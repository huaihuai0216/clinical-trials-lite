Having an autologous stem cell transplant to replace the blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy, allows higher doses of chemotherapy to be given so that more plasma cells are killed. By reducing the number of plasma cells, the disease may progress more slowly. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant in treating primary systemic amyloidosis.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects and how well giving low-dose melphalan together with dexamethasone works compared with high-dose melphalan followed by an autologous stem cell transplant in treating patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hematologic Response Rate","timeFrame":"10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Low-Dose Melphalan","deltaMin":55.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"High-Dose Melphalan + Autologous HSC","deltaMin":69.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":34},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Edema limbs","Hemoglobin decreased","Platelet count decreased","Leukocyte count decreased"]}}
