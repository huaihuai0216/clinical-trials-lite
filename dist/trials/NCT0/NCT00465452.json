Side effects that we will monitor in particular include somnolence, peripheral edema, cognitive decline with and without hallucinations. PD patients followed in the MUO Neurology Clinic who are being treated with pramipexole and have evidence of at least one of the following symptoms: somnolence, cognitive impairment with or without hallucinations, or peripheral edema will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parts 3 (Motor Performance) and 4 (Disability).","timeFrame":"initial visit and at end of study 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Continuous Release Dopamine Agonist","deltaMin":19.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["General pains","Nervous System","Gastrointestinal","Upper Respiratory","Injury"]}}
