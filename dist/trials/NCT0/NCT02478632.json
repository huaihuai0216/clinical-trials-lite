These are Phase III, randomised, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching to DTG plus RPV from current integrase inhibitor (INI)-, non NNRTI-, or protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed, having HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels \\<50 copies per millilitre (c/mL). Randomisation in the parent studies will be stratified by baseline third agent class (INI, NNRTI, or PI), age group (\\< or =\\>50 years old) and participation in this Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) sub-study, therefore there will also be balance across the treatment arms in this sub-study both overall and with respect to baseline third agent class and age at entry.\n\nThe study population will include approximately 75 evaluable subjects recruited from the Early Switch DTG + RPV treatment group of the parent studies 201636 and 201637, and approximately 75 evaluable subjects from the Late Switch group who continue their current antiretroviral therapy (CAR) through to Week 52 across both the 201636 and 201637 (SWORD-1 and SWORD-2) studies. Subjects participating in study 202094 will have DEXA scans performed at Day 1 and at study Weeks 48, 100 and 148 in parallel with the corresponding scheduled visits in the parent studies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Total Hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Week 48","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 1) and Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG + RPV","deltaMin":1.34,"sd":null},{"arm":"Current Antiretroviral Regimen","deltaMin":0.05,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.014"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Canada","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29239893"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":53},"commonTop":[]}}
