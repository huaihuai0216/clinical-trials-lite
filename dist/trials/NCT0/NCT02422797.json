The study primarily assessed the non-inferiority antiviral activity of switching to DTG + RPV once daily compared to the continuation of current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) up to Week 48 with a switch visit for eligible subjects in the CAR group to initiate DTG + RPV therapy at Week 52. CAR included 2 NRTIs plus 1 HIV-1 integrase inhibitor (INI), or 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or 1 protease inhibitor (PI). The study included a 148-week open-label treatment phase, comprising of an Early Switch Phase (Day 1 to Week 52) and a Late Switch Phase (Week 52 to Week 148). The participants fulfilling the study eligibility criteria participated in the Early Switch Phase where they either switched from their CAR to DTG + RPV, or continued taking their CAR, until Week 52. At the end of Early Switch Phase, eligible participants proceeded to the Late Switch Phase where all participants in both DTG + RPV and CAR treatment groups received DTG + RPV therapy until Week 148. After Week 148, subjects could have been eligible to continue to receive DTG +RPV in the Continuation Phase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 Using Snapshot Algorithm","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG + RPV","deltaMin":94,"sd":null},{"arm":"Current Antiretroviral Regimen (CAR)","deltaMin":94,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":30},"locations":{"siteCount":61,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Russia","Spain","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31307948","29310899","29239893"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":261},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Bronchitis","Arthralgia","Headache"]}}
