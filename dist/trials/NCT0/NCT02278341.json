Anemia is a reduced number of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Hemoglobin (which contains iron) is important for the transport of oxygen in your blood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if roxadustat is effective and safe in the maintenance treatment of anemia in ESRD participants on stable dialysis. Roxadustat was compared to epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa, commercially available medicines for treatment of anemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) to the Average Hemoglobin (Hb) in Weeks 28-36 Without Rescue Therapy [EU (EMA)]","timeFrame":"Baseline and weeks 28 to 36","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Roxadustat","deltaMin":0.428,"sd":null},{"arm":"ESA (Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent)","deltaMin":0.193,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":143,"countries":["Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Czechia","France","Georgia","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38363466","36005278"],"seeAlso":["https://astellasclinicalstudyresults.com/study.aspx?ID=364"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":210,"n":414},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Iron deficiency","Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Headache"]}}
