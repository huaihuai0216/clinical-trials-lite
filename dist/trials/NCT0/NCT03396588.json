The objective of this application is to evaluate the effectiveness of clonidine as a treatment for neonates with NAS, in a randomized clinical trial. Our central hypothesis is that clonidine will effectively treat drug withdrawal manifestations in neonates.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Neurobehavioral Performance Summary Scores From the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS)","timeFrame":"Baseline (5-10 days post natal age) and one-month post-natal age (between 4-6 weeks of age), or at discharge, whichever comes first.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Clonidine","deltaMin":0.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Morphine","deltaMin":0.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Hours","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25624389","14993525"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":60},"commonTop":["Finnegan scores consecutively >8","Phenobarbitol added","Adjunct medication added"]}}
