No single existing intervention is likely to control malaria in Africa. Rather, improvements in malaria prevention are likely to come from strategies that employ multiple proven interventions targeting different populations. HIV-infected children represent one of the most vulnerable subpopulations in these countries. It is possible that the use of protease inhibitor (PI) - based antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected children living in areas of high malaria transmission could prevent malaria in this vulnerable population. An effective remedy that offers the possibility to further reduce malaria risk, such as PIs, is highly desirable. This study will determine whether a PI based ART regimen will reduce malaria among children living in a malaria endemic area of Uganda and receiving insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) and TS. This study will compare two different ART regimens. Children enrolled in the study will start or continue to receive either standard Ugandan first line treatment ART regimen (NNRTI+2 NRTIs) or an ART regimen containing the HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir/ritonavir +2 NRTIs) and followed for a period of 24 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence-density of Malaria Defined as the Number of Incident Episodes of Malaria Per Time at Risk.","timeFrame":"Time from randomization to at least 24 months of follow up or until end of the study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1: LPV/r + 2 NRTIs","deltaMin":1.32,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2: Nevirapine (NVP) or Efavirenz (EFV) + 2 NRTIs","deltaMin":2.25,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.04"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23190222","23358639","21876053","24326597","24759826","25742090","27580060","29052340"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":84},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Elevated Temperature","Thrombocytopenia Platelets, decreased","Anemia","Elevated ALT"]}}
