The most commonly used protocols of follicular stimulation now employs follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and long-acting agonists of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) to prevent the occurrence of a mid-cycle luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and to ensure the induction of well-synchronized larger cohort of ovarian follicles.\n\nThe results of a number of studies have demonstrated that in the majority of clinical situations, FSH administration alone is sufficient to achieve successful follicular development. A study had shown that in subjects receiving recombinant human-follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) and recombinant human-luteinizing hormone (r-hLH), pregnancy rates were similar in the younger and older age groups, however, in women receiving r-hFSH alone, there was a significant decline in pregnancy rates for women 35 and older. This particular study also went on to show that the subgroup of women 35 and older, may benefit from supplementary r-hLH. A number of studies have been conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of r-hLH administered concomitantly with r-hFSH in the presence of developing follicles to reduce the rate of growth of intermediate and small follicles while allowing the dominant follicle to continue to progress.\n\nThis was a Phase III, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate safety and efficacy of addition of Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone (Luveris) to a standard assisted reproductive technologies (ART) protocol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Number of Metaphase II Oocytes Per Participant Who Underwent Ovum Pick up for Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)","timeFrame":"On the day of ovum pick up (Day 1 or 2 after human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] administration).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone (Luveris)","deltaMin":9.5,"sd":4.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":52},"commonTop":["Local tolerability of injections","Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome","Constipation","Diarrhea","Fatigue"]}}
