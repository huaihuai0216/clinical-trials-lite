Information is lacking on Multi-focal ERG and microperimetry outcomes with ranibizumab therapy. Additionally, VA and OCT outcomes don't always correlate and other assessments such as the Multi-focal ERG and microperimetry may be useful as early predictors of when patients should be retreated. This study will assess 2 groups (monthly and PRN therapy) and assess high resolution OCT, microperimetry, and Multi-focal ERG outcomes. For the PRN group retreatment will be based on OCT criteria. We will investigate if microperimetry or multifocal ERG would have been an early predictor of fluid recurrence.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Multifocal Electroretinography N1-P1 Amplitude","timeFrame":"One Year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Monthly Ranibizumab","deltaMin":3.6,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"PRN Ranibizumab","deltaMin":5.3,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"Ranibizumab 0.5 mg","deltaMin":4.9,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"Ranibizumab 2.0 mg","deltaMin":4,"sd":0.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Injection Site Irritation","Corneal Abrasion"]}}
