This study has a Preliminary Part (I) in which all subjects are treated with Fibrin Sealant Grifols and a Primary Part (II) in which subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Fibrin Sealant Grifols or manual compression.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Subjects Achieving Hemostasis by Four Minutes After Treatment Start","timeFrame":"From start of treatment until 4 minutes after treatment start","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fibrin Sealant Grifols","deltaMin":76.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Manual Compression","deltaMin":22.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Hungary","Russia","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38695613"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":168},"commonTop":["Procedural pain","Pyrexia","Oedema peripheral","Body temperature increased","Anaemia"]}}
