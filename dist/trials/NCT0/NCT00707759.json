To investigate the impact of this protocol in growth, bone metabolism, insulin- sensitivity and evaluate the expression of IL17 (interleukin 17) and mRNA FOXP3 (messenger ribonucleic acid forkhead box protein 3) as early markers of acute rejection (blood, urine and renal biopsy).\n\nHypothesis:Steroid withdrawal in renal pediatric transplant patients improves growth and bone metabolism without increasing the risk of acute rejection. The expression of FoxP3/IL17 in urine cells could be an early molecular markers of acute rejection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Stimulation of Growth After 12 Months (Delta Z-score)","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A: Withdrawal Steroids","deltaMin":1.2,"sd":0.2},{"arm":"B: Control Steroids","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":0.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Chile"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
