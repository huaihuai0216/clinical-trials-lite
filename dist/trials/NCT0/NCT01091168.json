Alkylating agents showed a modest activity in pretreated metastatic breast cancer. This phase III trial will compare the effectiveness and the safety profile of vinflunine to an alkylating agent of physician choice in MBC patients who have exhausted anthracyclines, taxanes, antimetabolites and vinca-alkaloids.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From baseline up to 3 years 1 month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vinflunine","deltaMin":9.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Alkylating Agent","deltaMin":9.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.673"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":80,"countries":["Argentina","Austria","Belarus","Belgium","France","Germany","Italy","Portugal","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29481630"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":82,"n":297},"commonTop":["Nausea","Asthenia","Constipation","Abdominal pain","Stomatitis"]}}
