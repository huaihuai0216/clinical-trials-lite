It is expected that this improved comprehensive protocol for cardiac MRI be accurate at detecting significant coronary artery disease and may obviate the need for other more expensive and invasive diagnostic tests currently used.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Magnetic Resonance Image Quality Rating","timeFrame":"Cross sectional study; magnetic resonance images were obtained on all patients using two different acquisition methods.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ischemic Heart Disease Patients","deltaMin":3.57,"sd":0.66}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}
