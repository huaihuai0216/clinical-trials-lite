Applying topical treatments such as adapalene gel may cause irritant adverse effects. Hence, using a moisturizer is another way to protect or relieve this undesirable event. Moisturizers that have anti-inflammatory property could reduce irritant effects, emergent from using topical treatment and also reduce severity of acne.\n\nResearch teams chose an adapalene gel to act as topical treatment for curing acne. It has anti-inflammatory and comedolytic effects and has fewer side effects than other groups of topical retinoic acids. However, peeling skin, redness skin, tingling sensation or itching sensation may occur if they are continually used for a long period. Thus, for the purpose of studying the efficacy of moisturizer containing licochalcone A, L-carnitine and 1,2-decanediol in reducing irritant effect of using adapalene gel (Licochalcone A has anti-inflammatory effect, L-carnitine decrease sebum production and 1,2-decanediol has anti-bacterial effect).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Reduction of Undesirable Effects","timeFrame":"2nd week, 4th week, and 8th week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Adapalene Gel","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adapalene Gel With Placebo Moisturizer","deltaMin":38,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adapalene Gel With Eucerin","deltaMin":35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.016"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.025"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.571"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.449"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26293170"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}
