Secondary endpoints include BMD changes at the total hip and the femoral neck, changes in body height, changes in bone mineral metabolism parameters, incidence of fractures, and allograft function at one year. Safety measurements include the occurrence of rejection episodes, infectious complications, graft loss and mortality.\n\n* Trial with medicinal product","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in BMD at the Total Lumbar Spine From Baseline to Month 12","timeFrame":"Baseline and month 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Denosumab","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":3.8},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":-0.3,"sd":5.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26713403","39382091"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":46},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infections","Hypocalcemia","Exanthema","Sore throat","Tremor"]}}
