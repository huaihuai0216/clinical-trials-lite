Vilazodone HCl under the trade name Viibrydâ„¢ is approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (how well the drug works), safety (the side effects), and tolerability (how well tolerated) of Vilazodone in preventing relapse or recurrence of depression. As vilazodone is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent the recurrence of depression, for the purposes of this study it is considered investigational. The word \"investigational\" means that the study drug is still being tested in research studies and has not been approved for this use by the FDA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Total MADRS Scores From Baseline to Week 8","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vilazodone 10mg","deltaMin":-24.95,"sd":10},{"arm":"Vilazodone 20mg","deltaMin":-18.95,"sd":9.71},{"arm":"Vilazodone 40mg","deltaMin":-23.89,"sd":6.75}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26693034"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["Dry Mouth","Weight Gain","Nausea","Diarrhea"]}}
