Approximately 160 eligible patients will be stratified based on the ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) and number of metastatic sites of disease (0 and 1 vs. \\>=2). The study consists of two treatment periods of 10 weeks with a 2-week wash-out period between the two treatment periods. Patients will receive pazopanib and sunitinib treatment sequentially in a double-blinded fashion. The primary objective of the study is to assess how the tolerability and safety differences between pazopanib and sunitinib translate into patient preference, defined by the patient's stated preference for which drug they may prefer to continue treatment with at end of study. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the reason for patient preference as assessed by a patient preference questionnaire; to evaluate fatigue as assessed by FACIT-Fatigue and quality of life as assessed by EuroQoL EQ-5D; to evaluate dose modifications and time to dose modification; and to evaluate safety.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Preference for Pazopanib Versus Sunitinib as Assessed by the Patient Preference Questionnaire (PPQ)","timeFrame":"End of treatment of both study drugs (maximum of 22 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sunitinib 50 mg Followed by Pazopanib 800 mg","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pazopanib 800 mg Followed by Sunitinib 50 mg","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":33},"locations":{"siteCount":51,"countries":["Finland","France","Germany","Italy","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37146227","35011579","26457466","24687826"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":35,"n":148},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Hypertension","Decreased appetite"]}}
