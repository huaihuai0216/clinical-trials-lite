Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In patients with Pompe disease, an excessive amount of glycogen accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle, which prevents their normal function. The overall objective is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of alglucosidase alfa treatment in patients with late-onset Pompe disease as compared to placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Summary of Patients Reporting Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events","timeFrame":"weeks 0-78","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Alglucosidase Alfa","deltaMin":60,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":30,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","France","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21543987","20393176"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":60},"commonTop":["Fall","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Diarrhoea","Hypoacusis"]}}
