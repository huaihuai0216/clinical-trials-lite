Between 75 and 100 eligible patients will be enrolled. Patients will receive afamelanotide (16 mg implants) or placebo according to the following dosing regimen:\n\n* Group A will be administered afamelanotide implants on Days 0, 60 and 120\n* Group B will be administered placebo implants on Days 0, 60 and 120\n\nThe number and severity of phototoxic reactions, the type and duration of sun exposure, treatment-emergent adverse events and the use of concomitant medication will be recorded by patients in study diaries between Days 0 and 180. Quality of life will be measured using the DLQI and EPP-QoL at Days 0, 60, 120 and 180. Participants will visit the clinic on Days 60, 120 and 180 for assessments of adverse events.\n\nA subset of patients will be photoprovoked on the lower back and dorsal surface of the hand and the minimal symptom dose (MSD) will be determined on Days 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Duration of Direct Sunlight Exposure Between 10:00 and 18:00 Hours on Days When no Pain Was Experienced (Pain Score of 0).","timeFrame":"Daily for 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Afamelanotide","deltaMin":69.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":40.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26132941"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":48},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Back Pain","Implant site discolouration"]}}
