Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ system dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of every other week dosing of GA-GCB (velaglucerase alfa) in participants with type 1 Gaucher disease who were previously treated with imiglucerase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants Who Experienced at Least One Adverse Event","timeFrame":"Week 53","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GA-GCB (Velaglucerase Alfa)","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Israel","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23339116"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":40},"commonTop":["Headache","Arthralgia","Nasopharyngitis","Back pain","Cough"]}}
