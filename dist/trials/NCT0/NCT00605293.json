Participants currently receiving maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa will be randomized either to receive monthly injections of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms Mircera, with the starting dose derived from the dose of epoetin alfa they were receiving in the week preceding study start, or to continue on epoetin alfa treatment. The anticipated duration of study is 32 weeks, and the target sample size is 146 participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hemoglobin (Hb) Concentration Within Plus Minus (+/-) 1 Grams Per Deciliter (g/dL) of Their Reference Hb and Between 10 and 12 g/dL During the EEP","timeFrame":"EEP (Week 16 to 23)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"C.E.R.A","deltaMin":45.45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Epoetin Alfa","deltaMin":55.17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4778"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":65},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Atrial fibrillation","Nasopharyngitis","Hyperlipidaemia","Hyperphosphataemia"]}}
