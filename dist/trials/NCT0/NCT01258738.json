During period one there will be a comparison of Etanercept (ETN) against a placebo with both arms maintaining the background anti inflammatory drug prescribed by their Physician. The hypothesis is that Etanercept will be superior to the placebo arm as determined by the proportion of subjects achieving Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS)40 improvement at 12 weeks. This will be followed by 92 weeks extension where everyone in the trial receives Etanercept (ETN) and a background non steroidal anti inflammatory drug(NSAID).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 40 Response at Week 12","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Etanercept","deltaMin":32.38,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":15.74,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0062"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["Argentina","Belgium","Colombia","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Netherlands","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38359938","35840157","33514428","31900174","28970213","28970212","28673924","28587658","28482137","26269397","24891317"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=B1801031&StudyName=Study%20Comparing%20Etanercept%20%28ETN%29%20Against%20a%20Placebo%20for%20Etanercept%20on%20a%20Background%20Nonsteroidal%20Anti%20Inflammatory%20Drug%20%28NSAIDs%29%20in%20"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":111},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Headache","Gastroenteritis"]}}
