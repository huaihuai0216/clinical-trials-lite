New laser technologies such as the Moses Pulse laser system provide for improved energy delivery which may decrease blood loss and operative time. We seek to evaluate Moses technology for enucleation of the prostate in the setting of BPH.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Operative Time","timeFrame":"intraoperatively","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Holmium Laser Enucleation of Prostate","deltaMin":101,"sd":30},{"arm":"Moses Holmium Laser Enucleation of Prostate","deltaMin":126,"sd":22}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":30},"commonTop":[]}}
