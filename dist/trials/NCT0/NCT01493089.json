Although a number of treatment options are available, a more effective therapy is still required. The failure of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to completely resolve symptoms is an accepted problem, with approximately 25% of patients with GERD continuing to experience the symptoms of heartburn in spite of treatment. This study aims to demonstrate an earlier onset to relief of symptoms in patients suffering from heartburn associated with GERD using an immediate-release omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate formulation when compared with delayed-release omeprazole (Losec®).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Determination of Median Time to Sustained Partial Response as Defined by Reduction in Likert Severity Scale Used to Assess Pain Associated With Heartburn in the Patient","timeFrame":"up to 14 days following treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zegerid Group","deltaMin":37.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Losec Group","deltaMin":37.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.563"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25706883"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":122},"commonTop":["Nausea","Abdominal distension","abdominal pain upper","flatulence","Influenza like illness"]}}
