Safety information on the rate of capsular contracture, rupture, and infection will be collected, and used to help determine device safety.\n\nApproximately 1000 patients at centers across the United States will be enrolled in this research study. These patients will be implanted with silicone breast prostheses and monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"10-Year Kaplan-Meier Estimated Cumulative Incidence Rate of Occurrence of Any Reoperation","timeFrame":"10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Primary Augmentation","deltaMin":25.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Primary Reconstruction","deltaMin":49,"sd":null},{"arm":"Revison Augmentation","deltaMin":43.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Revision Reconstruction","deltaMin":50.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33620918","25158767"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":552},"commonTop":[]}}
