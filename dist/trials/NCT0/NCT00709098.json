This is a double-blind (12 week), randomized study to compare the safety and tolerability of inhaled iloprost power disc-15 and power disc-6 in patients with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). After completion of the double blind period, patients will be entered in the open label period using iloprost power disc-15.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment-emergent Adverse Events","timeFrame":"Double-blind period: from first inhalation of study drug to end of 12-week treatment period.
