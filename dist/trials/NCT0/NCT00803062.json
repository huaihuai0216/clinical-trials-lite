Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective when given together with cisplatin or topotecan with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with cervical cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From entry into the study to death or the date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Paclitaxel and Cisplatin)","deltaMin":14.26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Bevacizumab)","deltaMin":17.51,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm III (Topotecan Hydrochloride and Paclitaxel)","deltaMin":12.68,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm IV (Topotecan Hydrochloride, Paclitaxel, Bevacizumab)","deltaMin":16.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":16,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":549,"countries":["United States","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36898292","32847980","28756902","25638326","24552320"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":42,"n":112},"commonTop":["Hemoglobin","Leukocytes","Fatigue","Neutrophils","Hair Loss/Alopecia (Scalp Or Body)"]}}
