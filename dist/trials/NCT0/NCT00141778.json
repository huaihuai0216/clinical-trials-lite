Post-operative AF, which leads to significant morbidity and a prolonged hospital stay, complicates 20% to 40% of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgical procedures. While recent studies indicate that interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or AT1 receptor antagonism decreases the incidence of AF following a heart attack or cardioversion (electric shock to the heart), its effect on the incidence of post-operative AF has not been throughly studied. Studies in both animals and humans suggest that inflammation-induced atrial remodeling plays an important role in the cause of AF. Recent studies also provide evidence that activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system induces inflammation, myocyte injury, proarrhythmic electrical remodeling, and fibrosis through aldosterone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation","timeFrame":"Measured from admission to the ICU until discharge from hospital","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":27.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ramipril","deltaMin":27.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Spironolactone","deltaMin":25.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.95"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20599398","18824641","22824930","39878152","25468655","22626819"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":147},"commonTop":["Hypokalemia","Hypotension","Hyperkalemia"]}}
