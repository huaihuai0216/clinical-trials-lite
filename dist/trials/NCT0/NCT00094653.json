Survival time will be evaluated, as well as patient responses and time to disease progression. Eligible patients are those who in response to a single regimen containing interleukin-2 (IL-2), dacarbazine, and/or temozolomide, have 1) relapsed following an objective response (partial response/complete response \\[PR/CR\\]); 2) failed to demonstrate an objective response (PR/CR); or 3) could not tolerate such a regimen due to unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be randomized into one of three groups, and will receive one of the following treatments: MDX-010 alone, MDX-1379 alone, or MDX-010 in combination with MDX-1379.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) (Time-to-Death) Difference Between MDX-010 in Combination With gp 100 Melanoma Peptide Vaccine Versus gp 100 Melanoma Peptide Vaccine Alone","timeFrame":"From randomization until the end of the study, which was defined as the time at which 481 deaths were observed (264 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ipilimumab Plus gp100","deltaMin":9.95,"sd":null},{"arm":"gp100","deltaMin":6.44,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":209,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","France","Germany","Hungary","Netherlands","South Africa","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26700304","26627641","25667295","25649350","25214238","23942774","23444228","23400564","22694829","20525992"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":55,"n":131},"commonTop":["FATIGUE","NAUSEA","DIARRHOEA","DECREASED APPETITE","CONSTIPATION"]}}
