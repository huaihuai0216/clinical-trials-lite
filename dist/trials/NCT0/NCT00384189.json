Treatment medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide or placebo will be inhaled once daily in the evening. The study consists of a baseline period (2 to 4 weeks) and a treatment period (12 weeks). The study provides further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ciclesonide 40 µg","deltaMin":15.23,"sd":2.69},{"arm":"Ciclesonide 80 µg","deltaMin":14.79,"sd":2.6},{"arm":"Ciclesonide 160 µg","deltaMin":17.37,"sd":2.68},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":5.4,"sd":3.71}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.0116"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0148"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0028"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":122,"countries":["Bulgaria","Germany","Hungary","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20619624"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":305},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Pharyngitis","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
