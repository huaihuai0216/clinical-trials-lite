The ultimate objective will be clinical application of these drugs in the emergency department for the treatment of acute headache and migraine.\n\nThe two phenothiazines (metoclopramide and prochlorperazine) have been routinely utilized in the treatment of acute headache and migraine in the emergency department setting. Per the 2017 American Headache Society guidelines, both intravenous metoclopramide and intravenous procholorperazine are recommended as \"clinicians should offer\" agents with level B evidence. Of note, there are no agents with level A evidence purported by this guideline for acute management of migraine. The same guideline offers \"no recommendation can be made regarding the role of intravenous magnesium for adults who present to the ED with acute migraine. However intravenous magnesium may be of benefit to patients who present with migraine with aura.\" Multiple trials have evaluated intravenous magnesium's safety and efficacy in the management of acute migraine. These have demonstrated the tolerability of intravenous magnesium on a with breadth of patients. Most commonly the primary adverse event was flushing which self-resolved. No cases of hypotension were reported.\n\nNone of these study agents have been withdrawn from the market.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"30 Minute Pain Score","timeFrame":"30 minutes after initiation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Magnesium","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Metoclopramide","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prochlorperazine","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":61},"commonTop":[]}}
