This study examined the long-term effectiveness of different anti-HIV drug combinations in children and strategies for switching treatment if the first treatment does not work. The study enrolled children who had not previously taken anti-HIV medication. Participants in this study were recruited in the United States, South America and Europe.\n\nSome European children may also enroll in a substudy that will observe changes in body fat in children taking anti-HIV medications.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Viral Load Measured in log10 HIV-1 RNA Copies/ml","timeFrame":"Baseline visit and 4 years after Study Entry","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Drug Class/PI","deltaMin":-3.16,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Drug Class/NNRTI","deltaMin":-3.31,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Switch Point (1K)","deltaMin":-3.26,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Switch Point (30K)","deltaMin":-3.2,"sd":0.09}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.26"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.56"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":31,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15886376","14724792","14724793","14758118","21288774"],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00006304"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":66},"commonTop":[]}}
