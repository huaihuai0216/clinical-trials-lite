The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a superior wound closure rate of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) of neuropathic origin after a maximum of 12 weeks topical daily application of trafermin 0.01% spray compared with placebo, in addition to best local care (off-loading, dressings). Approximately 210 patients will be randomized and it is planned that this study will be conducted at approximately 40 investigational sites in Europe.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Wound Closure Rate of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) of Neuropathic Origin After a Maximum of 12 Weeks Topical Daily Application of Trafermin 0.01% Spray Compared With Placebo, in Addition to Best Local Cares","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trafermin","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":16.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4039"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","Netherlands","Poland","Slovakia","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":105},"commonTop":["Diabetic foot","Diabetic foot infection","Edema peripheral"]}}
