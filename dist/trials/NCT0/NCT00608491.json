When a person's condition worsens to the point of hospitalization, that person is said to have acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Abnormal kidney function in association with cardiac distress, known as cardiorenal syndrome, is a common complication of heart failure and causes further medical problems and need for hospitalization. While there are various effective treatments for heart failure, more research is needed to determine the best treatment for targeting both ADHF and cardiorenal syndrome. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of ultrafiltration versus standard medical drug therapy in improving renal function and relieving fluid buildup in people hospitalized with ADHF and cardiorenal syndrome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Serum Creatinine","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to Day 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Stepped Pharmacologic Care","deltaMin":-0.04,"sd":0.53},{"arm":"Ultrafiltration","deltaMin":0.23,"sd":0.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23131078","31163974","28130379","26927285","26041600","25543972"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":54,"n":94},"commonTop":[]}}
