Vedolizumab SC will be given as an injection just under the skin. This type of injection is called a subcutaneous injection or SC for short. Another aim of the study is to collect information on whether the participant's condition remains under control or improves during and after treatment with Vedolizumab SC.\n\nParticipants who previously took part in studies MLN0002SC-3027 or MLN0002SC-3031 will be invited to visit the study clinic. At this visit, the study doctor will check if each participant can take part in this study.\n\nFor those who can take part, participants will receive a subcutaneous injection of vedolizumab SC either once a week or once every 2 weeks. How often each participant receives vedolizumab SC will depend on their results from the previous study and on how active their condition is. Participants might be able to self-inject vedolizumab SC after being trained by the study doctors. During this study, the dose of vedolizumab SC might be increased for participants whose condition worsens.\n\nParticipants will continue treatment with vedolizumab SC until it is approved in their particular country, the participant decides to stop treatment, or the sponsor stops the study. If the sponsor stops the study before vedolizumab SC is approved in all countries, the sponsor will make sure all affected participants will have access to vedolizumab SC outside of the study.\n\nAfter their final dose of vedolizumab SC, participants will visit the clinic 18 weeks later for a final check-up. Then, the clinic will telephone the participants 6 months after their final dose of vedolizumab SC to check if they have any health problems.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs Adjusted by Duration of Participant's Exposure to Long-term Vedolizumab Treatment","timeFrame":"Up to 97.9 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ulcerative Colitis: Vedolizumab 108 mg","deltaMin":22.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Crohn's Disease: Vedolizumab 108 mg","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":301,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Lithuania","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37492976"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b60274db2bf003ab498d5"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":163},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Crohn's disease","Upper respiratory tract infection","Abdominal pain","Arthralgia"]}}
