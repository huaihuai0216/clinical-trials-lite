Both types of omega-3 fatty acids are commonly found in fish oils. It is believed that a deficiency in these omega-3 fatty acids may lead to the development of major depression.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Score on a Depression Severity Rating Scale Over Eight Weeks","timeFrame":"8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA)","deltaMin":-10.34,"sd":0.62},{"arm":"Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)","deltaMin":-9.26,"sd":0.62},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-9.49,"sd":0.61}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34817851"],"seeAlso":["http://www.massgeneral.org/depression"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Difficulty sleeping","Decreased energy","Poor concentration","Anxiety","Fatigue"]}}
