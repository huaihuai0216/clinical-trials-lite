Participants with antidepressant-induced and antihypertensive-induce xerostomia were divided into two groups: for the first 'intervention group' a topical sialogogue spray (1% malic acid) was applied, while for the second 'control group', a placebo spray was applied; for both groups the sprays were applied on demand during two weeks. The Dry Mouth Questionnaire (DMQ) was used to evaluate xerostomia levels before and after product/placebo application. Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flows rates, before and after application, were measured.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Dry Mouth Questionnaire (DMQ)","timeFrame":"2 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Malic Acid 1%","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":0.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":100},"commonTop":[]}}
