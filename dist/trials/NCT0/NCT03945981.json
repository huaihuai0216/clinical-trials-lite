Suppressing viral replication with ART also reduces the potential for transmission of HIV. Hence, ART is recommended for all persons with HIV viremia regardless of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count. This is an open-label single arm which will evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety using a fixed dose combination (FDC) of Dolutegravir (DTG) plus Lamivudine (3TC) as a first line regimen of a rapid Test and Treat model of care over 48 weeks. Participants with new and confirmed diagnosed HIV-1 who are willing to start study treatment immediately following diagnosis will receive 50 milligram (mg) DTG + 300 (mg) 3TC FDC as first line therapy without waiting for screening laboratory results, at the Screening/Day 1 Visit. The total duration for the study will be 52 weeks and 4 weeks of follow up period if required. This study will be conducted in United States (US) with approximately 120 participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) Regardless of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Regimen at Week 24 by ITT-E Missing = Failure Analysis","timeFrame":"At Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG Plus 3TC","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34115650","40134635"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":131},"commonTop":["Headache","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Depression","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
