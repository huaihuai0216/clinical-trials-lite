Enhanced support is especially important when undertaking and sustaining new challenging self-care tasks, such as initiating or intensifying insulin treatment regimens. Although some VAs have implemented telephone nurse care management programs supported by automated calling services, many are reluctant to adopt these models due to nursing shortages.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycemic Control (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"6 months (baseline to 6 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Reciprocal Peer Support Group","deltaMin":8.02,"sd":1.32},{"arm":"Nurse Case Management Group","deltaMin":7.93,"sd":1.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20956707"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":125},"commonTop":[]}}
