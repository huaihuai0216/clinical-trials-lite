Negative pressure wound therapy is a commonly used method of applying suction on wounds to remove fluid from wound and to promote healing. The VAC system is widely used and consists of a foam dressing and a portable computerized suction pump. The G-SUC method uses commonly available dressing supplies attached to vacuum (suction) pump located on the wall above a hospital bed. The investigators have frequently used both methods over the past 10 years and have not observed any specific negative side effects of either.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Wounds With Complete Skin Graft Take","timeFrame":"Day 4 or 5","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GSUC","deltaMin":80,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vacuum-assisted Closure","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.80"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":57},"commonTop":[]}}
