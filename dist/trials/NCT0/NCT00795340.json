Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether cediranib is more effective than a placebo when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well cediranib works when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"at every 3 months visit throughout trial, a median of 13.1 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cediranib","deltaMin":12.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":12.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["Brazil","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24360368"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":67,"n":153},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Alopecia","Neuropathy-sensory","Cough","Nausea"]}}
