Eight courses of treatment with either placebo or IGIV-C will occur every 3 weeks. Neurological function will be measured by Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) scores. Patients who deteriorate or show no improvement between day 16 and month 6 will receive the alternate study drug for an additional 6 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Comparison of the Responder Rates Between Two Treatment Groups in the Efficacy Period","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IGIV-C","deltaMin":54.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":20.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Poland","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18178525","19260050","19365055","19496683","20837852","20647554","20457948"],"seeAlso":["http://www.talecris-pi.info/inserts/gamunex.pdf","http://www.talecris-pi.info/inserts/plasbumin25la.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":113},"commonTop":["Headache","Pyrexia","Hypertension","Asthenia","Back pain"]}}
