This parasite is mainly spread by insects called triatomine bug. If Chagas' disease is left untreated, it can later cause serious heart and digestive problems.\n\nThe study treatment nifurtimox has been used for more than 50 years to treat Chagas' disease. When used early after infection, it kills the parasite. In people who have long-term Chagas' disease, it's no longer possible to kill the parasite. However, nifurtimox may help slow the progression of the disease and its most serious complications.\n\nNifurtimox was developed for use in adults only, but has also been used in children (off-label) for over 40 years. Currently it is available for doctors to give to adults and to children. However, there are not enough data about nifurtimox in children.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well nifurtimox works in children aged 8 months to less than 18 years with Chagas' disease. To answer this, the researchers will compare the amount of antibodies against the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi in the serum (fluid from blood without the clotting factors) between children treated with nifurtimox for 60 days with untreated children from the past (control group):\n\n* 12 months and\n* 4 years after the end of treatment. The data for the control group will come from 2 previous studies conducted in children.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part 1 - Percentage of Sero-reduction or Sero-conversion (Cured Subjects)","timeFrame":"At 12 months post-treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nifurtimox 60 Days / Arm 1","deltaMin":32.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nifurtimox 30 Days, Then Placebo 30 Days / Arm 2","deltaMin":18.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["Argentina","Bolivia","Colombia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["9790423","8937280","33412557","37352322","36975790"],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/","https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/","https://filehosting-v2.pharmacm.com/api/Attachment/Download?tenantId=80217261&amp;parentIdentifier=16027&amp;attachmentIdentifier=341adaa4-a747-4150-98c6-4f09a62e7bcb&amp;fileName=Bayer_16027_PLS_v2.0_2022_08_30.pdf&amp;versionIdentifier="]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":219},"commonTop":["Headache","Vomiting","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Decreased appetite"]}}
