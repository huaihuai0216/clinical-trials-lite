A secondary aim is to determine whether valproate therapy delays the progression of cognitive and functional measures of the illness. This trial will also assess the tolerability and safety of low-dose, long-term valproate therapy. Valproate, an anticonvulsant drug, was selected because of its possible symptomatic efficacy for agitation in AD, known safety profile in numerous clinical populations, and in view of recent data supporting its neuroprotective potential in AD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Presence of Agitation and/or Psychosis Measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Combined With an Assessment of the Clinical Significance of Behavioral Change Rated by the Study Clinician","timeFrame":"24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Valproate","deltaMin":25,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":29,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.88"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":46,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12453674","11126389","10037507","21810649"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":51,"n":153},"commonTop":["Confusional state","Somnolence","Agitation","Fall","Asthenia"]}}
