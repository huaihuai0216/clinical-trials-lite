Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side effects of radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with amifostine and chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Two Year Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"Up to Two Year After Enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Stratum II","deltaMin":0.87,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":109,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31657981","31553639"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":79,"n":111},"commonTop":["Hearing impaired","Fever","Vomiting","Tinnitus","White blood cell decreased"]}}
