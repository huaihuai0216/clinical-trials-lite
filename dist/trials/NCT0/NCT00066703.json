Hormone therapy using triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-free Survival","timeFrame":"5-year estimate reported at a median follow-up of 72 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"T+OFS","deltaMin":87.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"E+OFS","deltaMin":91.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":228,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Egypt","Germany","Hungary","India","Italy","New Zealand","Peru","Slovenia","South Africa","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18325918","20482225","24095609","24881463","36521078","31618131","29863451","28911092","27825388","27044936","26092816"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":484,"n":1321},"commonTop":["Hot flashes/flushes","Pain - Joint","Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Sweating (diaphoresis)","Insomnia"]}}
