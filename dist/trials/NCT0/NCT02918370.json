Primary Aim will be to assess change in alcohol use by the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method. Secondary Aim will include change in alcohol craving using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). Changes in psychiatric symptoms (mania/hypomania and depression) and predictors of response will be assessed. Participants with â‰¥ 1 drinking day at week 12 will be enrolled in a 4-week extension phase with an upward titration to 30 mg/day for those in the active treatment group. The placebo group will remain on placebo.\n\nSubjects will be discontinued from the study if any of the following conditions occurs: change in diagnosis to other than bipolar I or II disorder and AUD, development of active suicidal or homicidal ideation with plan and intent, worsening in mood symptoms, that in the opinion of the investigators requires discontinuation, pregnancy, development of severe or life-threatening medical condition, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration, significant alcohol withdrawal (e.g. delirium tremens) based on clinical judgment (increases in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scores will initiate a careful clinical assessment of possible worsening of withdrawal symptoms), or cocaine or amphetamine-positive urine drug screen during the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Timeline Follow Back (TLFB)","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aripiprazole","deltaMin":-0.82,"sd":5.86},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.71,"sd":4.23}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":36},"commonTop":["Nausea or vomiting","Restlessness/Fidgeting","Somnolence","increased appetite or weight gain","Dry mouth"]}}
