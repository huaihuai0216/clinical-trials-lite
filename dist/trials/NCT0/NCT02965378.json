This is a sub-study that includes all screened patients positive for the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) biomarker. FGFR can cause tumor cells to grow more quickly. AZD4547 may decrease the activity of FGFR and may be able to shrink tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Objective Response Rate (Confirmed and Unconfirmed, Complete and Partial)","timeFrame":"From date of registration to maximum of 2 years and 4 months or death.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I - AZD4547","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":43,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1084,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":27},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Anemia","Anorexia","Dry mouth","Dysgeusia"]}}
