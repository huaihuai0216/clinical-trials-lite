The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of evinacumab IV on other lipid parameters, evaluate the effect of evinacumab on LDL-C goal attainment, assess the effect of evinacumab on eligibility for apheresis (using German and US apheresis criteria), evaluate the safety and tolerability of evinacumab in patients with HoFH, assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of evinacumab in patients with HoFH and evaluate the potential development of anti-evinacumab antibodies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Calculated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) From Baseline to Week 24 (Intent-to-Treat [ITT] Estimand)","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo IV Q4W","deltaMin":1.9,"sd":6.5},{"arm":"Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W","deltaMin":-47.1,"sd":4.6}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Canada","France","Greece","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","South Africa","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40169529","32813947"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Influenza like illness","Toothache","Nausea"]}}
