The investigators will investigate the effect of switching to Truvada (a combination pill of tenofovir and emtricitabine, the other two components of Atripla) plus raltegravir.\n\nRaltegravir is a licensed drug for HIV treatment which showed side effects were fewer in number when compared to efavirenz in 2 other clinical studies, where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time.\n\nThis study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine blood tests which the investigators ordinarily use to monitor your treatment) and monitor effectiveness, your viral load and CD4 counts, when you switch treatment from Atripla速 to Truvada/raltegravir.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Rate of Neuropsychiatric and Central Nervous System (CNS) Toxicity of Raltegravir Therapy After 4 Weeks on Treatment","timeFrame":"4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Single Arm","deltaMin":26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":40},"commonTop":["Bilateral Arm Pain","Ichthyosis","Haematuria","Renal Colic","Cellulitis"]}}
