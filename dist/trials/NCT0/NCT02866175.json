This study is designed to evaluate the safety and to explore the efficacy of an edoxaban-based antithrombotic regimen versus a vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-based antithrombotic regimen in subjects with AF following PCI with stent placement. Bleeding is a central safety outcome in cardiovascular clinical trials, especially for antithrombotic strategies and invasive procedures.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adjudicated Major or Clinically Relevant Non-major Bleeding As First Event Defined by International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Following Edoxaban-based Regimen Compared With Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)-Based Regimen","timeFrame":"Day 1 to 12 months postdose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Edoxaban Regimen","deltaMin":128,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vitamin K Antagonist Regimen","deltaMin":152,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":200,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Lithuania","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Serbia","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33098470","31492505","29421002"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":176,"n":746},"commonTop":["Cardiac failure","Atrial fibrillation","Non-cardiac chest pain","Oedema peripheral","Dizziness"]}}
