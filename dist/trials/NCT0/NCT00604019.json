The trial will enroll patients with suspected or documented site of infection and having 2 out of the three SIRS criteria. Patients will also be receiving standard of care, early-goal directed therapy including but not limited to fluid resuscitation, appropriate and early antibiotics, source control and evaluation for drotrecogin alpha where deemed appropriate, while being supported for septic shock.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy and Safety of Dopamine Versus Norepinephrine in Septic Shock","timeFrame":"28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dopamine","deltaMin":67,"sd":null},{"arm":"Norepinephrine","deltaMin":51,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19851126"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":134},"commonTop":[]}}
