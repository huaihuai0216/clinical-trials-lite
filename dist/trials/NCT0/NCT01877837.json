Sickle cell disease is a recessive disorder caused by a point mutation that results in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the B-chain of hemoglobin. This leads to sickling of the red blood cells under many conditions, such as hypoxia, dehydration, and hyperthermia. The sickling leads to vaso-occlusion, which causes irreversible damage in almost all systems in the body, including the central nervous system (CNS), lungs, heart, bones, eyes, liver, and kidneys.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Graft Failure","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":25},"commonTop":[]}}
