The trial is conducted in patients diagnosed with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) who are recommended for treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate adherence to a three-month (12-dose) regimen of weekly rifapentine and isoniazid (3RPT/INH) given by directly observed therapy (DOT) compared to self-administered therapy (SAT). The secondary objectives:\n\n* To compare the treatment completion rates between participants randomized to SAT without reminders versus SAT with weekly SMS reminders\n* To evaluate the timing of doses and patterns of adherence to once weekly RPT/INH among participants who complete treatment and those who discontinue therapy prior to completion.\n* To determine the availability and acceptability of using SMS reminders among all patients consenting to participate in the study.\n* To determine the toxicity and tolerability by comparing the rates of any drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events or death between the DOT arm and the SAT arms (both combined and individually)\n* To compare the frequency, timing, and causes for failure to complete treatment between the DOT arm and the SAT arms\n* To collect patient-specific cost data related to the 3 treatment arms\n* To describe the pattern of antituberculosis drug resistance among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains cultured from participants who develop active TB.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Completion Rate.","timeFrame":"Up to 16 weeks from start of treatment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"3HP Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)","deltaMin":294,"sd":null},{"arm":"3HP Self Administered Therapy (SAT)","deltaMin":248,"sd":null},{"arm":"3HP SAT With SMS Reminders","deltaMin":250,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States","China","South Africa","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22150035","22157884","24200264","25904367","36815322","29393655","29114781"],"seeAlso":["https://www.cdc.gov/tb/research/tbtc.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":337},"commonTop":["Other","Systemic Drug Reaction","Hepatitis","Thrombocytopenia","Neutropenia"]}}
