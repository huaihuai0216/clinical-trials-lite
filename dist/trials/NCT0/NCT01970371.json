An additional cohort of patients with BSI, HABP, VABP, complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), or acute pyelonephritis (AP) due to CRE, not eligible for inclusion in the other cohort, were enrolled into a single arm (Cohort 2) and treated with plazomicin-based therapy. Therapeutic drug management (TDM) was used to help ensure that plazomicin exposures lie within an acceptable range of the target mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With All Cause Mortality (ACM) at Day 28 or Significant Disease-Related Complication (SDRC) in the Microbiological Modified Intent to Treat (mMITT) Population in Cohort 1","timeFrame":"Up to Day 28 for ACM, up to 7 Days for SDRCs in all patients, on or after Day 5 for BSI patients only.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Plazomicin in Combination With Meropenem or Tigecycline","deltaMin":23.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Colistin in Combination With Meropenem or Tigecycline","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["31254273"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":18},"commonTop":["Acute kidney injury","Anaemia","Diarrhoea","Thrombocytopenia","Delirium"]}}
