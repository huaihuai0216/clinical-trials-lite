This study will test whether children receiving a high dose of vitamin D have less frequent and less severe asthma exacerbations compared with those receiving placebo.The study will also document the safety profile of this strategy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Serum 25OHD","timeFrame":"During the 7-month follow-up period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vitamin D","deltaMin":9.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30777118","33305842"],"seeAlso":["http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30777118/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":24},"commonTop":["infections and infestations (SOC)","General (SOC)","Investigations (SOC)","Respiratory (SOC)","Gastrointestinal disorders (SOC)"]}}
