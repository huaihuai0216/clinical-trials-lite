Important factors contributing to low bone density in AN include low levels of estrogen and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). While estrogen is important for preventing bone loss, IGF-1 is important for optimizing bone formation. We have shown in a previous study that replacement of estrogen is effective in increasing bone density in teenage girls with AN; however, this increase in bone density remains lower than that seen in normal-weight controls over the same duration, and residual deficits persist. Importantly, the impact of administering replacement doses of IGF-1 with estrogen replacement has not been studied in teenagers with AN.\n\nThis study will examine the impact of administering recombinant human (rh) insulin like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) with estrogen (to mimic pubertal levels of these hormones) versus administration of estrogen alone on bone metabolism in adolescent girls with anorexia nervosa (AN).\n\nOne aim of this proposal is to investigate whether co-administration of insulin like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) with physiologic estradiol replacement to adolescent girls with AN will increase BMD (bone mineral density) more than estrogen monotherapy, and whether bone mass will approach that seen in healthy adolescent girls. An additional aim is to determine whether co-administration of rhIGF-1 with estradiol to mimic the normal pubertal milieu stimulates bone formation through an IGF-1 mediated anabolic effect, increases bone density to a greater extent than estrogen monotherapy, and improves bone mass accrual to approach that in healthy controls. The impact of rhIGF-1 +estradiol versus estradiol alone on bone microarchitecture will also be assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Bone Density Over a 12-month Period","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rh IGF-1 + Transdermal Estradiol","deltaMin":0.045,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Transdermal Estradiol","deltaMin":0.28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".109"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"14 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":38},"commonTop":["Headache","Vasovagal with venipuncture","Constipation","Irritation at patch site","Irregular menses"]}}
