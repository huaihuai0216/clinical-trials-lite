Sedentary persons are particularly vulnerable for these health problems and generally not adherent to prescribed physical activity. This study will investigate if treatment with vitamin D will benefit physical performance in male veterans age 65 to 95.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Short Physical Performance Battery Test Score","timeFrame":"baseline and 9 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Arm","deltaMin":7.3,"sd":1.69},{"arm":"Cholecalciferol 4000 IU","deltaMin":7,"sd":1.62}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":64},"commonTop":["fall","hypercalcemia"]}}
