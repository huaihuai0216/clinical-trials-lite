Enrollment in the study was conducted in two stages. In Stage I of the study, approximately 400 subjects receiving non-biological DMARDs (with the exception of methotrexate \\[MTX\\] monotherapy or MTX and leflunomide combination therapy) were enrolled. In Stage II of the study, approximately 160 subjects receiving a Federal Drug Administration-approved biological DMARD at the time of screening were enrolled.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Developing a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Within 24 Weeks After Receiving the First Course of Rituximab Treatment","timeFrame":"From first treatment with rituximab (Day 1) through Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab 1000 mg (Stage I Patients)","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Rituximab 500 mg (Stage II Patients)","deltaMin":9.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":36},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["23547218"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":48,"n":401},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Rheumatoid arthritis","Sinusitis","Headache","Urinary tract infection"]}}
