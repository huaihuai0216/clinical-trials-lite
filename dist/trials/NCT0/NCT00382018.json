Measuring blood levels of tumor cells may help in learning how well chemotherapy works to kill metastatic breast cancer cells and allow doctors to plan better treatment. When blood levels of tumor cells are high while receiving chemotherapy, it is not yet known whether it is more effective to change chemotherapy regimens at that time or wait until disease progression.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying treatment decision making based on blood levels of tumor cells in women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Every 3 months until progression then every 6 months for 5 years or until death","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm C1 (Baseline CTCs >= 5, Day 22 CTCs >= 5, High Risk)","deltaMin":10.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C2 (Baseline CTCs >= 5, Day 22 CTCs >= 5, High Risk)","deltaMin":12.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.98"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":296,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24888818"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":161},"commonTop":["Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Hemoglobin","Neutrophils/granulocytes (ANC/AGC)","Pain - Bone","Diarrhea"]}}
