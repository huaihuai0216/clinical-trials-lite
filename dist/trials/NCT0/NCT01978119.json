The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that FSC 250/50 mcg administered BID by capsule-based inhaler is non-inferior compared to FSC 250/50 mcg administered BID by multi-dose inhaler . The study consists of six phases: Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 3 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 31 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 85","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 85","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FSC Capsule-Based Unit Dose DPI","deltaMin":0.231,"sd":0.0339},{"arm":"FSC Multi-Dose DPI","deltaMin":0.203,"sd":0.0338}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27599598"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":82},"commonTop":["Headache","Hypertension","Blood pressure increased"]}}
