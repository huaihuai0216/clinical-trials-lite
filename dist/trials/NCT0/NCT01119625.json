In addition, the study will also assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a fourth dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A (commercial lot) when co-administered with Infanrix-IPV/Hib at 18-21 months of age in children primed in study NCT00808444.\n\nThe primary vaccination study was conducted in Malaysia and Singapore. The booster vaccination study will not be performed in Malaysia since the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A has been registered in September 2009. However, subjects in Malaysia will be offered a booster dose of the commercial pneumococcal conjugate vaccine licensed in Malaysia and Infanrix-IPV/Hib vaccine during the second year of life according to the nationally recommended regimen. Administration of the booster dose will be outside the set-up of a clinical trial. Hence no data will be collected, no blood samples will be taken in Malaysia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Concentrations of Antibodies Against Vaccine Pneumococcal Serotypes.","timeFrame":"Before booster vaccination at Month 0","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Synflorix™ Clinical-Commercial + Infanrix™-IPV/Hib Group","deltaMin":0.48,"sd":null},{"arm":"Synflorix™ Commercial-Commercial + Infanrix™-IPV/Hib Group","deltaMin":0.35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25278086"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":118},"commonTop":["Pain","Fever","Redness","Irritability","Swelling"]}}
