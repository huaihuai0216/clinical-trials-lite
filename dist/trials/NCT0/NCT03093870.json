Varlitinib (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with cancer by simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of Biliary Tract Cancer. Treatment groups are Varlitinib+capecitabine and Placebo + capecitabine","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Part 1","timeFrame":"Data obtained up until progression, or until last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, regardless of whether subjects discontinued treatment or received a subsequent therapy prior to progression, up to 2 years.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Varlitinib and Capecitabine","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo and Capecitabine","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States","Australia","China","Hong Kong","Hungary","Japan","Poland","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":24},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Blood Bilirubin Increased","Decreased Appetite","Palmar-plantar Erythrodysaethesia Syndrome"]}}
