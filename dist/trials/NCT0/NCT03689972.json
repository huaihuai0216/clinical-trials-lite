The secondary objectives is to evaluate relapse-based clinical efficacy measures, disability worsening, additional Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-lesion efficacy measures and safety of Q6W in participants who have previously been treated with natalizumab Q4W for at least 12 months, in relation to continued Q4W treatment.\n\nPart 2: The primary objective is to evaluate participant preference for subcutaneous (SC) versus intravenous (IV) route of natalizumab administration.
