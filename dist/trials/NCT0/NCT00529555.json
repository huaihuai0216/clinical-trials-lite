This is also called scaling and root planing. Placing a topical antibiotic into the periodontal pocket at the time of scaling and root planing may help reduce pocket depth and thus help the periodontal disease. Periocline (minocycline HCl) 2.1% gel is a topical antibiotic approved in a number of countries for this use, and is now being tested in the US.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Pocket Depth.","timeFrame":"baseline & 9 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Scaling and Root Planing + SHAM TX","deltaMin":-1.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Scaling and Root Planing + Periocline Gel","deltaMin":-1.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Scaling and Root Planing + Vehicle","deltaMin":-1.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":200},"commonTop":["Gastrointestinal disorders","Injury, poisoning and procedural complications","Gerenal Disorders and adminstration site conditions","Infections and infestations","Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders"]}}
