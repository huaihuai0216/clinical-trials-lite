Therefore in Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) 2009 combination therapy is recommended. In JSH 2009 it is advised to start the combination therapy at a low dose, and to increase the dosage when the antihypertensive effect is not sufficient. In the Japanese long-term safety study, 259 patients received the T40/A5 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC), and after 6 weeks treatment 48 patients of them could not control their blood pressure (DBP =90) (U09-2494-01). For those patients who cannot control their blood pressure with T40/A5 mg FDC, a switch to a higher dose such as T80/A5 mg is recommended.\n\nIn the overseas 4x4 factorial design trial, a clinically meaningful difference of the blood pressure lowering effect between T80/A5 mg free combination and T40/A5 mg free combination was shown (U07-3503-02). But the sponsor has no data that verifies this difference in Japanese patients.\n\nThus, this clinical trial is being conducted to investigate the antihypertensive effect and safety of high dose T80/A5 mg FDC compared with low dose T40/A5 mg FDC in Japanese patients with essential hypertension. In this trial, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group comparison method is employed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Reduction From the Reference Baseline in Mean Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) at Trough","timeFrame":"Reference baseline, 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"80 mg Telmisartan and 5 mg Amlodipine FDC","deltaMin":4.93,"sd":0.61},{"arm":"40 mg Telmisartan and 5 mg Amlodipine FDC","deltaMin":3.47,"sd":0.61}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":112},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}
