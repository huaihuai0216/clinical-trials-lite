The primary objective is overall survival. Secondary objectives include progression free survival, overall response rate, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response/progression, pain response/progression, overall safety, and pharmacokinetics. Patients will be treated until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 10 cycles. Patients will have long-term follow-up for a maximum of up to 2 years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From the date of randomization up to 104 weeks (study cut-off)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mitoxantrone + Prednisone","deltaMin":12.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cabazitaxel + Prednisone","deltaMin":15.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Russia","Singapore","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25538172","23723295","22743148","20888992"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":77,"n":371},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Asthenia"]}}
