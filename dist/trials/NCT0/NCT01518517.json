Clinical allergy is associated with inactivation of asparaginase by antibodies (A-Abs), which can also neutralize asparaginase without any clinical signs of hypersensitivity (silent inactivation). GRASPA improves pharmacokinetics, tolerability and maintain circulating asparaginase activity due to the protective barrier of the erythrocyte membrane.\n\nThis study is run to confirm the benefit/risk profile of GRASPA at 150 IU/kg in combination with the COOPRALL regimen in adults and children patients with relapsed ALL, with or without known hypersensitivity to L-asparaginase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Duration of Asparaginase Activity >100 U/L During Induction","timeFrame":"Induction treatment period (i.e. 28 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GRASPA Non Allergic","deltaMin":18.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Reference L-asparaginase","deltaMin":8.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["Belgium","France"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":26},"commonTop":["Leukopenia","Neutropenia","Thrombocytopenia","Lymphopenia","Transaminases increased"]}}
