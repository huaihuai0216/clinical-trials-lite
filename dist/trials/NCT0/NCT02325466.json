Study participants will be randomized into 3 groups, and each group will receive each of 3 treatments in the cross-over study. At the end of each individual 4 week treatment period the investigators will determine whether there are differences in low and high shear rate dependent viscosity and investigate the effect of the treatment on peripheral arterial blood flow using pulse volume recordings, ankle brachial index and toe pressures. Subjects will be eligible if they have ankle-brachial index less than or equal to 0.85, or if a patient's blood vessels are calcified, patients will have toe-brachial index less than or equal to 0.6 performed using continuous-wave Doppler.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Low Shear Blood Viscosity","timeFrame":"baseline, week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aspirin/Ticagrelor Placebo","deltaMin":1.045,"sd":1.525},{"arm":"Aspirin/Ticagrelor","deltaMin":-1.793,"sd":1.835},{"arm":"Aspirin Placebo/Ticagrelor","deltaMin":-1.759,"sd":1.298}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31174526"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":70},"commonTop":["Shortness of Breath"]}}
