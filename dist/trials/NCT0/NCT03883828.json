This study is being conducted because prior studies from this research group have found bacterial colonization in the nose prior to initiation of RT to be associated with an increased risk of high-grade RD. Patients in the treatment arm will receive pretreatment with mupirocin ointment to the nares and chlorhexidine wash to the body while patients in the control arm will receive standard of care treatment. Bacterial cultures will be taken from the nares and skin, and participants will also complete a quality of life questionnaire before and after RT.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Incidence of High Grade Radiation Dermatitis","timeFrame":"Last treatment session (study week depends on patient's length of treatment), approximately 5 to 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Arm","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37140904"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":39},"commonTop":["Itch"]}}
