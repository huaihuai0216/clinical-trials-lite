The hypothesis is that PET-guided Bone Marrow Sparing IMRT will reduce acute hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity and increase chemotherapy tolerance for cervical cancer patients treated with concurrent cisplatin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary Event (Acute Hematologic or GI Toxicity)","timeFrame":"Up to 30 days post radiation, about one month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IMRT Arm (Phase II)","deltaMin":55,"sd":null},{"arm":"PET-Guided BMS-IMRT (Phase II)","deltaMin":46,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States","China","Czechia","India","Poland","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":55},"commonTop":["Grade 3 or higher neutropenia","Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity","Clinically significant GI toxicity","Grade 2 GI toxicity","Grade 3 or higher GI toxicity"]}}
