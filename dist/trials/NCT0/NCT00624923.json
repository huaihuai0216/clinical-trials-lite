We will evaluate the effects of targeting inflammation using the anti-inflammatory drug salsalate, compared to placebo, on coronary artery plaque volume assessed by multi-detector computed tomographic angiography (MDCTA). The TINSAL-CVD study is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, 2 arm, clinical trial.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to compare the effect of salsalate or placebo on sub-acute inflammation and coronary plaque, in people with cardiovascular disease. Participants are randomized to active intervention (salsalate) or placebo interventions for a period of 30 months. The primary endpoint is change in plaque volume in the coronary arteries assessed by MDCTA from baseline to 30 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Non-calcified Plaque Volume in the Coronary Arteries Assessed by MDCTA From Baseline to 30 Months","timeFrame":"Baseline to 30 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1- Active Pharmacologic","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"2-Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16823477","17959861","19337387","20231565","23817699","23370525","25220612","28045401","27438318","27438317","34425254"],"seeAlso":["http://tinsalt2d.org","http://joslin.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":127},"commonTop":["Respiratory","Ear and Labyrinth","Dyspnea","General","Gastrointestinal"]}}
