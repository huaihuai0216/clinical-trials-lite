Experts warn that the next influenza pandemic is imminent and could be severe. Prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and worldwide distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. Candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines must be developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the best formulation and vaccination schedule.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the immune response of a candidate pandemic vaccine. The protocol posting deals with objectives \\& outcome measures of the secondary phase of this study. The objectives and outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol posting (NCT number = 00449670).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Boosted at Month 12 With Haemagglutinin-inhibition (HI) Antibody Concentrations Above the Cut-off Value","timeFrame":"At Month 12 + 21 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GSK1562902A M12 Group","deltaMin":178,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["Hong Kong","Singapore","Taiwan","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24628789"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":219},"commonTop":["Pain","Myalgia","Fatigue","Headache","Arthralgia"]}}
