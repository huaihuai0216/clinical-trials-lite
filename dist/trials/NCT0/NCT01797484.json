This effect was shown by significantly reduced areas of atypical or dysfunctional myocardium in SPECT-examinations.\n\nThe dimension of myocardial damage (i.e. area of ischemic myocardium) is directly related to the rate of complications (i.e. left-ventricular pump failure, malignant arrhythmia) and the grade of Rehabilitation to daily life (i.e. persistent reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction).\n\nIn patients with stable angina pectoris, Ranolazine is used with beneficial results1. Ranolazine improves diastolic blood flow and therefore microcirculation in the myocardium by reducing diastolic tension (via inhibiting late Na+-Influx and consecutive Ca2+-Overload).\n\nRecently published data2 showed that treatment with Ranolazine significantly reduces the ischemic area in chronic damaged myocardium. This is due the effect of improved microcirculation in hibernating myocardium.\n\nEarly administration of Ranolazine and improvement of microcirculation in patients with acute damaged myocardium (i.e. directly after acute ischemia) should lead to a recruitment and re-uptake of cardiac activity of hibernating myocardium.\n\nFor the RIMINI-Trial patients are given Ranolazine on top of the guideline-based treatment to reduce the area of acute ischemic myocardium.\n\nPatients with unstable angina pectoris and proof of acute cardiac ischemia, proof of myocardial dyskinesia and angina pectoris in the patient history will receive unaltered guideline-based therapy for acute cardiac ischemia5,6. All necessary procedures will be performed to stabilize patients to a hemodynamically compensated state and patients are then transferred to receive cardiac catheterization (angiography and angioplasty if necessary).\n\nAfter patients are stabilized Ranolazine will be given additionally to guideline based medication.\n\nThe measurement of the ischemic myocardial area will be done via three functional echocardiographies with speckle tracking technique10.\n\nA statistical evaluation of ischemic myocardial area before and after treatment with Ranolazine/Placebo will be done after conclusion of the RIMINI-Trial to show the effect of Ranolazine in acute myocardial ischemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Left Ventricular Global Strain Rate","timeFrame":"42 days after first dose of Ranolazine","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ranolazine","deltaMin":18,"sd":2},{"arm":"No Additional Medication","deltaMin":23,"sd":3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17456819","19909934","20840192","19004841","17569677","21270073","16990383","20717762","20362924","29938533"],"seeAlso":["http://www.uhz.de"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
