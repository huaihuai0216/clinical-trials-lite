This study will look at the change in the participants' body weight from the start to the end of the study. The study compares the weight loss in people who get semaglutide to the weight loss in people who get placebo. Placebo is a \"dummy\" medicine that looks like the study medicine, but has no effect on the body.\n\nParticipants will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm.\n\nParticipants will also have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more physically active and what participants can do to lose weight.\n\nThe study will last for about a year (50 weeks). Participants will have 10 clinic visits and 8 phone calls. At 6 of the clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken.\n\nParticipants cannot take part if participants have or have had diabetes. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to get pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight (%) : In-trial Observation Period","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), end of treatment (week 44)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide","deltaMin":-16.4,"sd":7.3},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.6,"sd":5.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["South Korea","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40825340"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":101},"commonTop":["Nausea","COVID-19","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
