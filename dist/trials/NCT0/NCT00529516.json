In this observer blind study, the subjects previously enrolled in study 104888 (NCT00377585) will receive a dose with the 2007-2008 season's formulations of Fluarix or GSK576389A. Only subjects who were previously enrolled in study 104888 (NCT00377585) are eligible for participation in this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"During a 7-day follow-up period after vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FluAS25 Group","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluarix ≥ 65 Years Age Group","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluarix 18-40 Years Age Group","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Germany","Norway"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":475},"commonTop":["Pain at the injection site","Myalgia","Fatigue","Headache","Shivering"]}}
