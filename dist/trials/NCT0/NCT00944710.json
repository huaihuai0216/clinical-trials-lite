Children ages 3 to \\<8 years with visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/400 in the amblyopic eye will be enrolled in a run-in phase with weekend atropine until no improvement, followed by randomization of eligible patients to weekend atropine treatment with a plano lens over the sound eye versus without a plano lens over the sound eye. The primary objective is to determine if adding a plano lens to weekend atropine will improve visual acuity in patients with amblyopia still present after visual acuity has stabilized with initial treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Distribution of 10-week Amblyopic-Eye Visual Acuity","timeFrame":"10 weeks after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intensified Treatment","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25727586"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Light Sensitivity","New ocular deviation or worsening of preexisting deviation by at least 10 PD"]}}
