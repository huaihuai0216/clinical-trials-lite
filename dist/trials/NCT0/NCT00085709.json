Monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether induction therapy using cytarabine and daunorubicin is more effective with or without gemtuzumab ozogamicin or whether postconsolidation therapy using gemtuzumab ozogamicin is more effective than no additional therapy in treating de novo (first occurrence) acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different regimens of chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody therapy to see how well they work in treating patients with previously untreated de novo acute myeloid leukemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"2-year Disease-free Survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"After completing any treatment, every 6 months for 2 years, than annually for years 3-5","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Post-consolidation GO","deltaMin":39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Post-consolidation Observation","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":279,"countries":["United States","Canada","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37534515","37267439","25527568","24383844","23591789"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":47,"n":293},"commonTop":["Febrile neutropenia","Nausea","Platelets","Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Neutrophils/granulocytes (ANC/AGC)"]}}
