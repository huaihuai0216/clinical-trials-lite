Diabetic participants will also be treated with open label, background,metformin HCl. Two-hundred sixty subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 200 pre-diabetic subjects are planned to be be enrolled. Qualified subjects with T2DM will be randomized 1:1 to receive metformin HCl plus colesevelam HCl or metformin HCl plus placebo matching colesevelam HCl. Qualified pre-diabetic subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive colesevelam HCl or matching placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change of Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) From Baseline to 16 Weeks When Given as Initial Therapy to Drug-naïve, Diabetic Subjects.","timeFrame":"Baseline to 16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Type 2 Diabetes Group: Placebo + Metformin","deltaMin":-0.83,"sd":0.064},{"arm":"Type 2 Diabetes Group: Colesevelam + Metformin","deltaMin":-1.09,"sd":0.064}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0035"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":31,"countries":["United States","Colombia","India","Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22913890","22836068","20634176","20634175"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":141},"commonTop":["Headache","Influenza","Nausea","Constipation","Back pain"]}}
