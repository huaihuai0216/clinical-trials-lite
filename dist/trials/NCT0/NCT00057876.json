Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without radiation therapy in treating pancreatic cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine with or without radiation therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival Time","timeFrame":"assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for year 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gemcitabine","deltaMin":9.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gemcitabine + Radiation","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.017"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":229,"countries":["United States","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":35},"commonTop":["Anemia","Nausea","Weight loss","Vomiting"]}}
