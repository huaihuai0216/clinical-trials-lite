The End of Study visit in studies 01, 02, and 06 will be set as the Visit 1 (Day 0) of this study. There will be no interruption of study treatment between the parent studies and this study.\n\nIt is planned that approximately 150 patients will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to two groups to receive either budesonide MMX 6 mg or placebo irrespective of the treatment assigned in studies 01, 02, or 06. Treatments will be administered once a day after breakfast for a maximum of 12 months or up to the occurrence of the first clinical relapse, where clinical relapse is defined as combined recurrence of rectal bleeding and stool frequency ≥ 1-2 stools/day above normal for the patient (score ≥ 1 in both UCDAI items).\n\nDuring the study, patients will be assessed for safety and efficacy at Visit 1 and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment.\n\nPatients will be contacted by telephone on a monthly basis for safety assessment. In case of occurrence of symptoms suggestive of clinical relapse, patients will attend an unscheduled visit at any time during the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission","timeFrame":"1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2: Placebo","deltaMin":76.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"1: Budesonide MMX® 6 mg","deltaMin":88.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":58,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":61},"commonTop":["Colitis ulcerative","Abdominal pain","Headache","Osteopenia","Frequent bowel movements"]}}
