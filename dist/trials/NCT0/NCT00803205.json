A specific type of mutation called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of CF in approximately 10% of patients with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 3 trial that will evaluate the clinical benefit of ataluren in adult and pediatric participants with CF due to a nonsense mutation. The main goals of the study are to understand whether ataluren can improve pulmonary function and whether the drug can safely be given for a long period of time. The study will also assess the effects of ataluren on CF pulmonary exacerbation frequency, cough frequency, health-related quality of life, antibiotic use for CF-related infections, CF-related disruptions to daily living, body weight, and CF pathophysiology.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Predicted Function (Percent-Predicted) of Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 1)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ataluren","deltaMin":62.092,"sd":13.6159},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":60.232,"sd":15.1437}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3264"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24836205","36866921"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":46,"n":120},"commonTop":["Cystic fibrosis lung","Cough","Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Pyrexia","Abdominal pain"]}}
