Those currently receiving darbepoetin alfa, epoetin alfa, or epoetin beta maintenance treatment will receive intravenous Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200, or 360 micrograms (mcg) per month (based on the erythropoiesis stimulating agent \\[ESA\\] dose administered on Week -1). Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the country-specific target range (11 to 13 grams per deciliter \\[g/dL\\] for Switzerland and 10 to 12 g/dL for Austria).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Within Plus/Minus (Â±) 1 g/dL of Reference Hb or Within Target Range During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)","timeFrame":"At Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1, 0; pre-dose (0 hours) and immediately before dialysis (minimum 3 sessions per week) during Weeks 18, 20, 22, 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mircera in Renal Anemia","deltaMin":75.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":27,"countries":["Austria","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":43,"n":91},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fall","Diarrhoea","Hypertension","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
