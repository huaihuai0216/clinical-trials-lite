Eligible patients will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio into 1 of the 2 treatment arms to receive either idelalisib plus rituximab or placebo plus rituximab. Participants who are tolerating primary study therapy but experience definitive CLL progression are eligible to receive active idelalisib therapy in the extension study, GS-US-312-0117.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival","timeFrame":"Up to 17 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Idelalisib + Rituximab","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Rituximab","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Italy","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33297794","32599655","24450857"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":110},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Cough","Pyrexia","Nausea","Infusion related reaction"]}}
