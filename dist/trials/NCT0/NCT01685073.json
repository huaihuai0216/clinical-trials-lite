Frequent marijuana users have reported that they have trouble sleeping when they try to quit, and that the loss of sleep can lead to relapse. This research is designed to measure the severity of sleep problems in people as they are trying to quit heavy use of marijuana, and to investigate whether extended-release zolpidem (Ambien CRÂ®) can improve quit rates among people trying to stop using marijuana.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sleep Efficiency as Assessed by Percentage of Time Asleep While in Bed","timeFrame":"Week 1 of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zolpidem","deltaMin":78,"sd":16},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":74,"sd":19}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28782982"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":62},"commonTop":["Cold symptoms","nausea","emesis","Headache","toothache"]}}
