Mirtazapine is a potent blocker of 5-HT2A receptors and was found to be effective in reducing the number and intensity of hot flushes in preliminary trials. Also several Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other similar compounds have been investigated to manage hot flushes, confirming the role of the serotonergic system. In the present trial, the efficacy and safety of four different doses of esmirtazapine compared to placebo was investigated in women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with the menopause. The primary study hypothesis was that esmirtazapine would show superior efficacy to placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 4","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-3.9,"sd":4.2},{"arm":"Esmirtazapine 2.25 mg","deltaMin":-5.6,"sd":3.8},{"arm":"Esmirtazapine 4.5 mg","deltaMin":-6,"sd":3.6},{"arm":"Esmirtazapine 9 mg","deltaMin":-6,"sd":4},{"arm":"Esmirtazapine 18mg","deltaMin":-6,"sd":4.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.01"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.01"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.01"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":"<0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["30712391"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":317},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Weight increased","Headache","Fatigue","Increased appetite"]}}
