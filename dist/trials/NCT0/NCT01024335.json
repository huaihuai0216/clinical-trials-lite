We hypothesize that administering dronabinol during detoxification and during the first few weeks of naltrexone treatment will lead to improved naltrexone tolerability, resulting in better naltrexone compliance and treatment retention, and ultimately a reduction in opioid use and relapse rates.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Opiate Withdrawal Measured by the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) .","timeFrame":"3x/week during 8 weeks of the trial or study participation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Naltrexone and Placebo","deltaMin":11.16,"sd":6.13},{"arm":"Naltrexone and Dronabinol","deltaMin":13.36,"sd":10.55}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":20},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Mood changes","Diarrhea","Nausea/vomiting","GI Distress"]}}
