Interstitial cystitis is a chronic bladder disease that includes the following symptoms: Urinary frequency during the day,urinary frequency at night, urinary urgency and bladder discomfort relieved by voiding.\n\nPresently, there is no cure for interstitial cystitis. The response to current treatments is poor. Patients with interstitial cystitis have a poorer quality of life. The cause of interstitial cystitis is unknown. This study is evaluating the drug Humira® (adalimumab) for improving the symptoms of patients with interstitial cystitis. Humira® is an injectable anti-inflammatory medication that has been available for use since December 31, 2002. Humira® has been FDA approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn's disease. These diseases have similar characteristics to interstitial cystitis. This study will evaluate an investigational use of Humira® for the treatment of interstitial cystitis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"O'Leary-Santa Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index and Problem Index (OSPI) Score","timeFrame":"Baseline/12 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Inactive Drug","deltaMin":27.7,"sd":4.9},{"arm":"Adalimumab","deltaMin":27.8,"sd":3.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.75"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23792149","32734597"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Infection","Pain","Diarrhea","Headache","Urinary Tract Infection"]}}
