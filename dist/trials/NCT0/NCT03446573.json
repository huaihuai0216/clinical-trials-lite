This study will also provide important information regarding the safety and participant satisfaction with this two-drug regimen. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced, virologically suppressed participants. This study also will characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC compared to TBR through Week 144 and characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC through Week 200.\n\nThis will be a 200-week, Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel- group study. The study will include a screening phase (up to 28 days), a randomized early switch phase (Day 1 up to Week 148), a randomized late switch phase (Week 148 up to Week 200), and a continuation phase (post Week 200). HIV-1 infected adults on stable TBR will be randomized 1:1 to switch to DTG + 3TC once daily for up to 200 weeks, or to continue their TBR for 148 weeks, at which time and if HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\<50 copies per milliliter (c/mL) at Week 144, these participants will switch to DTG + 3TC up to Week 200.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Virologic Failure Endpoint as Per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot Category at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG+3TC FDC (Early Switch)","deltaMin":0.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"TAF Based Regimen (Early Switch)","deltaMin":0.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":133,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Japan","Netherlands","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31905383","39015350","38737429","38587380","38515183","38213637","37520420","37376649","35079789","33587500"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":369},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Back pain","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
