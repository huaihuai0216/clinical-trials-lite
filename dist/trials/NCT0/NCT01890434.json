The duration for a subject in the study may range from 2 days to 4-6 weeks. One to four visits to the study doctor will be required.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that sensitivity and specificity of gadobutrol-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) exceed pre-specified minimum performance thresholds of 60% and 55%, respectively, and to show superior sensitivity over unenhanced wall motion CMRI at vasodilator rest/stress for the detection of significant CAD. The CMR images acquired with a uniform imaging acquisition software will be evaluated either against the results from routine clinical Coronary Angiography (CA) or Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), which are the standard of reference.\n\nCMRI and CA/CTA images will be collected for an independent image review (blinded read).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Presence of a Myocardial Perfusion Defect Indicating Significant CAD Per Participant on Gadobutrol-enhanced CMRI - Primary Analysis of Sensitivity Based on Blinded Readers' Assessment","timeFrame":"0 to 30/40 min post-injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg Body Weight","deltaMin":64.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":478},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Chest discomfort","Dyspnoea","Dysgeusia"]}}
