Lenalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether dexamethasone is more effective with or without lenalidomide in treating multiple myeloma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying dexamethasone and lenalidomide to see how well they work compared to dexamethasone alone in treating patients with previously untreated stage I, stage II, or stage III multiple myeloma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival","timeFrame":"From date of initial registration to date of progression/relapse of disease or death from any cause, whichever came first, up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenalidomide+Dexamethasone","deltaMin":78,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dexamethasone","deltaMin":52,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20876454"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":96},"commonTop":["Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Hemoglobin","Glucose, serum-high (hyperglycemia)","Calcium, serum-low (hypocalcemia)","Leukocytes (total WBC)"]}}
