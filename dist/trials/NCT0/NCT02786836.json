An evaluable patient is one who has completed one or more breath tests for at least 30 minutes after administration of the 13C-Methacetin solution (test substrate).\n\nThe Breath Test will be performed up to five times during the study period on all enrolled patients. The first Breath Test will be performed upon admission into the study (Day 1) and repeated on Days 2, 3, 5 and 7 provided no contra-indications are present. Each test continuously measures changes in the metabolism of the 13C-Methacetin in order to assess the improvement or deterioration in liver metabolic function about improvement or deterioration in liver metabolic function. If an enrolled non-APAP ALI or ALF patient receives a liver transplant, is discharged /transferred from the hospital or dies prior to Day 7, additional Breath Tests will not be performed.\n\nPatients will be contacted for the Day 21 follow up (21 days after enrollment into the trial) to determine spontaneous survival, transplantation and occurrence of serious adverse events since the patient's last study treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Peak Percent Dose Recovery (PDR) Value","timeFrame":"Days 1 and 21","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13C-Methacetin Breath Test (MBT)","deltaMin":10.2,"sd":7.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["2490426","16573791","20180786","26220750","19248196","17593076","15209153","5570565","11097497","18638013","28440304","37183883"],"seeAlso":["http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/acute-liver/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":62},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Nausea","Constipation","Diarrhoea","Gastrointestinal haemorrhage"]}}
