The current study uses a safe, convenient bedside imaging tool called contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to estimate the extent of microvascular perfusion impairment in the heart, kidneys and/or brain of COVID-19 pediatric patients in vivo and assess the significance of imaging findings by correlating to clinical outcomes.\n\nThis pilot study will be conducted at one site, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The investigators plan to enroll and evaluate 30 patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Estimate the Proportion of Patients With Normal Perfusion Versus Area(s) of Hypoperfusion in Heart, Kidneys and/or Brain","timeFrame":"15 minutes.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Contrast-enhanced Ultrasonography","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Minute","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32418446","32609336","32622375","32234718","32227090","32172546","32105632","32015507","31996437","32247631","32031570","32294295","32299776","32473124","13706404","22532616","28715949","28527200","23849270","28395964","31924423","30353273","29280236","28649730","30189812","30560547","31705672","20375378","36030353","35081803"],"seeAlso":["https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2002131","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.20032524"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":4},"commonTop":[]}}
