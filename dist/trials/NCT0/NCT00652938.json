Vaccination of pre-teens and adolescents, ideally before sexual debut and thus before exposure to oncogenic HPV, is a rational strategy for prevention of cervical cancer. Thus, HPV vaccination could complement the existing pre-adolescent/adolescent vaccination programs. This Phase IIIb study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of co-administering a commercially available vaccine with GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 (Cervarix TM) vaccine as compared to the administration of either vaccine alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Anti-Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (Anti-HBs) Antibody Concentrations Above the Cut-off Value for Seroprotection","timeFrame":"Month 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix&Engerix Group","deltaMin":190,"sd":null},{"arm":"Engerix Group","deltaMin":181,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["Netherlands","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21856349"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":247},"commonTop":["Pain","Headache","Fatigue","Redness","Swelling"]}}
