The hypothesis of the clinical study was that provision of the methionine metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) would correct abnormal hepatic methionine metabolism thereby effectively treating ALD. The two goals of the clinical research were a)to determine the clinical relationship of aberrant hepatic methionine metabolism to ALD by comparisons of patterns of serum methionine metabolites in groups of ALD patients, alcoholics without liver disease, and normal healthy subjects, and b) to determine the treatment effects of SAM on patterns of serum methionine metabolites and on the histopathology and biochemical features of liver injury in ALD patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes in Serum AST Levels","timeFrame":"Week 0 to week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe)","deltaMin":-13.5,"sd":51.344},{"arm":"Sugar Pill","deltaMin":-56,"sd":18.243}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20561703","22044287"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Abdominal bloating","Abdominal pain","Headache","Nausea"]}}
