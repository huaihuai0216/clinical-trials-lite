Rolapitant or placebo will be administered 1-2 hours prior to initiation of chemotherapy on Day 1 with granisetron and dexamethasone. Subjects will record all events of emesis and use of rescue medication for established nausea and/or vomiting, and will indicate the severity of nausea they experienced in each of the previous 24 hours in the Nausea and Vomiting (NV) Subject Diary prior to HEC administration through Day 6 of Cycle 1. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the FLIE Questionnaire on Day 6 of Cycle 1. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values.\n\nAll subjects are expected to complete Cycle 1 and will have the option of participating in up to five additional cycles.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"No Emetic Episodes and No Rescue Medication","timeFrame":">24 to 120 hours post chemotherapy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rolapitant + Granisetron + Dexamethasone","deltaMin":70.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Granisetron + Dexamethasone","deltaMin":61.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.043"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26272769"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":80,"n":272},"commonTop":["Asthenia","Constipation","Decreased Appetite","Neutropenia","Nausea"]}}
