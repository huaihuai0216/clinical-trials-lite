In participants with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), participants whose tumors are programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive (defined as combined positive score \\[CPS\\] ≥10), ESCC participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in all participants, overall survival (OS) is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.\n2. In participants with ESCC, participants whose tumors are PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥10), and in all participants, progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by investigator is superior with pembrolizumab plus SOC chemotherapy compared with placebo plus SOC chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) Whose Tumors Are Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Biomarker-Positive (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 34 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab + SOC","deltaMin":13.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + SOC","deltaMin":8.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":189,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","Colombia","Costa Rica","Denmark","France","Germany","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Japan","Malaysia","Peru","Romania","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38815152","38607538","37139963","35668304","35394255","34454674","30735435"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26081&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":207,"n":370},"commonTop":["Nausea","Anaemia","Decreased appetite","Constipation","Fatigue"]}}
