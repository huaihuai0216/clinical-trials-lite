Patients with one study eye will be randomly assigned (stratified by visual acuity and prior laser) with equal probability to one of the three treatment groups:\n\n1. Laser photocoagulation\n2. 1mg intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection\n3. 4mg intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection\n\nFor patients with two study eyes (both eyes eligible at the time of randomization), the right eye (stratified by visual acuity and prior laser) will be randomly assigned with equal probabilities to one of the three treatment groups listed above. The left eye will be assigned to the alternative treatment (laser or triamcinolone). If the left eye is assigned to triamcinolone, then the dose (1mg or 4 mg) will be randomly assigned to the left eye with equal probability (stratified by visual acuity and prior laser).\n\nThe study drug, triamcinolone acetonide, has been manufactured as a sterile intravitreal injectable by Allergan. Study eyes assigned to an intravitreal triamcinolone injection will receive a dose of either 1mg or 4mg. There is no indication of which treatment regimen will be better.\n\nPatients enrolled into the study will be followed for three years and will have study visits every 4 months after receiving their assigned study treatment. In addition, standard of care post-treatment visits will be performed at 4 weeks after each intravitreal injection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change In Visual Acuity [Measured With Electronic-Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS)]Baseline to 2 Years.","timeFrame":"Baseline to 2 Years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Focal/Grid Laser Photocoagulation","deltaMin":1,"sd":17},{"arm":"1mg Intravitreal Triamcinolone","deltaMin":-2,"sd":18},{"arm":"4 mg Intravitreal Triamcinolone","deltaMin":-3,"sd":22}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.02"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.002"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.49"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":84,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17765429","18698292","18662829","19273785","20122739","20008708","33206392","21571677"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":135,"n":330},"commonTop":["Vitreous floaters","Conjunctival Hemorrhage","Intraocular Pressure increased","Cataract Subcapsular","Visual acuity reduced"]}}
