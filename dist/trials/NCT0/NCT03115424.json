Comparative effectiveness of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) demonstrate that RYGB is significantly superior to SG in terms of weight loss and glycemic control. Both RYGB and SG increase GLP-1 concentrations which directly affect B-cell function. Data has shown that the postprandial rise in GLP-1 might affect feeding behavior after RYGB and to a lesser extent SG, where the increase in GLP-1 is less marked. In this study the investigators propose to randomize subjects undergoing SG to receive either placebo or Liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, to compare weight loss and CV risk factors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Weight","timeFrame":"baseline and 36 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sleeve Gastrectomy Saxenda","deltaMin":127,"sd":7},{"arm":"Sleeve Gastrectomy Placebo","deltaMin":130,"sd":8},{"arm":"Roux-en-Y Gastric (RYGB)","deltaMin":126,"sd":4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":12},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Hgb < 11.5 g/dL"]}}
