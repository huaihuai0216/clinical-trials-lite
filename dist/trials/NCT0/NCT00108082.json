Subjects with LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) and hypertension will be studied. The primary endpoint will be the change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) characterized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following 12 months of treatment. Secondary endpoints include the change in LV (left ventricular) mass, LV wall thickness, diastolic left ventricular filling parameters, and left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiographic methods at Treatment Month 12. Composite outcomes and individual event data will also be evaluated by treatment group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Model-adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Mass Indexed (LVMI) by Body Surface Area as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at Month 12","timeFrame":"Baseline and Month 12 (If Month 12 data were not available, the Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] analysis, which includes data collected on or after Month 9 of treatment to Month 12 of treatment, was used)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Carvedilol CR","deltaMin":-6.34,"sd":0.85},{"arm":"Atenolol","deltaMin":-6.67,"sd":0.756},{"arm":"Lisinopril","deltaMin":-7.94,"sd":0.85}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.7651"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.1711"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17023232","20980215"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4},"commonTop":["Headache","Cough","Dizziness","Fatigue","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
