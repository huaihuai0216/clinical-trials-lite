Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether receiving combined carboplatin and paclitaxel plus continued low-dose paclitaxel is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel alone for early-stage ovarian cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying carboplatin and paclitaxel alone too see how well they work compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel together with continued low-dose paclitaxel in treating patients with early-stage ovarian cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Paclitaxel + Carboplatin Followed 4 Weeks Later by Paclitaxel","deltaMin":20.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paclitaxel + Carboplatin Followed by Observation","deltaMin":23.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":151,"countries":["United States","Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21529904"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":274},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Leukopenia","Anema","Dermatologic","Gastrointestinal"]}}
