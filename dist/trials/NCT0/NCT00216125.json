Docetaxel was selected based upon a survival benefit in patients with recurrent NSCLC.\n\nThis trial will evaluate the role of consolidation therapy with docetaxel in patients with unresectable stage III disease. The purpose of the trial is to evaluate survival and toxicities of the regimens employed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Participants were measured from treatment initiation to death","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Consolidation Docetaxel","deltaMin":21.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Observation Only","deltaMin":24.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.883"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19001323"],"seeAlso":["http://www.hoosieroncologygroup.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":44,"n":77},"commonTop":["FATIGUE (ASTHENIA, LETHARGY, MALAISE)","NEUTROPHILS/GRANULOCYTES (ANC/AGC)","DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)","LEUKOCYTES (TOTAL WBC)","ESOPHAGITIS"]}}
