This infection generally requires hospital admission and antibiotic therapy. This treatment usually helps eradicate the infection but sometimes it is not possible to clear or it comes back after treatment. Also, once someone has had one line infection the chance of getting another one is higher. This study will test whether treatment and secondary prophylaxis of CLABSI with ethanol lock therapy (ELT) can significantly reduce the risk of treatment failure (comprising failure to clear initial infection, relapse or reinfection) in children and adolescents treated for cancer or hematologic disorders or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). ELT involves injecting a solution of ethanol and water into the line or port, allowing it to dwell for 2 hours, and then withdrawing the solution.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Therapeutic Failures (Early or Late Failure) in Children and Adolescents With CLABSI Receiving Standard Care Plus Ethanol Lock Therapy (ELT) vs. Standard Care Alone","timeFrame":"Up to 25 weeks after the start of treatment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment (Ethanol)","deltaMin":43.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control (Placebo)","deltaMin":43.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States","Australia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29884572"],"seeAlso":["http://www.stjude.org","http://www.stjude.org/protocols"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":48},"commonTop":["Chest pain (infusional)"]}}
