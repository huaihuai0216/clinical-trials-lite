The overall hypothesis is that metformin will have beneficial effects on longevity and quality of life by inducing autophagy downstream of activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibiting mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) through potential effects of reduced inflammation, reduced degeneration of muscle and tendon tissue, antineoplastic effects, reduced obesity and hyperglycemia, preserved cardiovascular functions, and/or the prevention of neurodegeneration (such as age-associated dementia). This pilot study will address the following aim:\n\nDemonstrate that metformin therapy will increase cellular autophagy as an inverse correlate of aging as measured by increases in Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) scores.\n\nHypothesis 1: In addition to beneficial effects on glycemia, body weight, and body composition, metformin therapy exerts beneficial effects on surrogate measures of autophagy and aging.\n\nPrimary outcome: Increased levels of LC3 in leukocytes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Leucocyte LC3 Score","timeFrame":"Data will be collected at 0 and 12 weeks and analyzed within 8 weeks of sample collection.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin","deltaMin":0.1,"sd":3.4},{"arm":"Placebo Oral Tablet","deltaMin":-1.8,"sd":3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":["Diarrhea"]}}
