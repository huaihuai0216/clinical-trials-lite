The study's purpose was to investigate the safety and effectiveness of a once-daily Truvada® pill (compared with placebo) in preventing HIV among HIV-uninfected women at risk of becoming infected through sexual intercourse.\n\nThe study population included HIV-antibody-negative women between the ages of 18-35 who were at risk of HIV acquisition through sexual intercourse. Each participant was randomized to take either a daily single oral tablet of Truvada®, which is a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC; 200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF; 300 mg), or an identical placebo.\n\nAfter enrollment, each participant was followed every four weeks. All participants were followed for an additional eight weeks after study drug was stopped. Incidence rates of HIV infection were compared between the two groups (active drug and placebo) using the intent-to-treat principle.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"HIV Infection","timeFrame":"Cumulative HIV infection between enrollment and 52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Truvada Arm","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Arm","deltaMin":35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Kenya","South Africa","Tanzania"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25539648","25503265","25459097","22784040"],"seeAlso":["http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/complement-factor-i-deficiency","http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hivaids.html","http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hepatitis.html","http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ProxyServlet?mergeData=true&objectHandle=DBMaint&APPLICATION_NAME=drugportal&actionHandle=default&nextPage=jsp/drugportal/ResultScreen.jsp&TXTSUPERLISTID=0000057114&QV1=N-OCTADECANOIC+ACID","http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ProxyServlet?mergeData=true&objectHandle=DBMaint&APPLICATION_NAME=drugportal&actionHandle=default&nextPage=jsp/drugportal/ResultScreen.jsp&TXTSUPERLISTID=0001592230&QV1=CALCIUM+STEARATE","http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ProxyServlet?mergeData=true&objectHandle=DBMaint&APPLICATION_NAME=drugportal&actionHandle=default&nextPage=jsp/drugportal/ResultScreen.jsp&TXTSUPERLISTID=0007047849&QV1=ALUMINUM+MONOSTEARATE","http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/fdalinks","http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1202614"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":1025},"commonTop":["Blood phosphorus decreased","Headache","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Malaria","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
