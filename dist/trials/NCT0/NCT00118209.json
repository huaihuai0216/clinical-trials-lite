Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective when given with rituximab in treating diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying rituximab when given together with two different combination chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival Rate at 2 and 5 Years","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years post-registration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm B - DA-EPOCH-R","deltaMin":78.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm A - R-CHOP","deltaMin":75.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.6519"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":47,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39809075","32232481","30939090","22180164"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":232,"n":243},"commonTop":["Hemoglobin decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Platelet count decreased","Leukocyte count decreased","Peripheral sensory neuropathy"]}}
