There have been no prospective randomized trials of treatment for GERD in preterm infants with apnea or other symptoms attributed to GER.\n\nMethods: A randomized, cross-over study will be performed. This cross-over design will provide the patient's clinician with unbiased information about the patient's response to treatment. The clinician can use this information in deciding whether or not to continue treatment after the two-week study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Bradycardia Episodes/Day","timeFrame":"7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Medications","deltaMin":4.6,"sd":3.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3.6,"sd":2.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Month","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19540518"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":[]}}
