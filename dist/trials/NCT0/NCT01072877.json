In this study, patients with varicose veins in the legs will be participating. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of three different concentrations of an investigational drug, polidocanol injectable foam compared to vehicle (inactive solution) in treating the symptoms and appearance of varicose veins.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Patient-reported Symptoms of Varicose Veins (VVSymQ Score)","timeFrame":"Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vehicle","deltaMin":2.13,"sd":0.452},{"arm":"Polidocanol Injectable Foam 0.125%","deltaMin":4.63,"sd":0.447},{"arm":"Polidocanol Injectable Foam 0.5%","deltaMin":5.68,"sd":0.483},{"arm":"Polidocanol Injectable Foam 1.0%","deltaMin":4.87,"sd":0.477},{"arm":"Polidocanol Injectable Foam 2.0%","deltaMin":5.78,"sd":0.425}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26384639"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":56},"commonTop":["Pain in extremity","Thrombophlebitis superficial","Injection site hematoma","Limb discomfort","Injection site pain"]}}
