The study involves two daytime clinical research center (CRC) visits with random assignment to receive G-Pen™ glucagon 1 mg during one period and Lilly Glucagon 1 mg during the other. Each daytime visit is preceded by an overnight stay in the CRC. In the morning of the inpatient study visit, the subject is brought into a state of hypoglycemia through IV administration of regular insulin diluted in normal saline. After a hypoglycemic state with plasma glucose \\< 50 mg/dL is verified, the subject is administered a dose of G-Pen or Lilly Glucagon via subcutaneous injection. Plasma glucose levels are monitored for up to 180 minutes post-dosing, with a value of \\>70.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes of glucagon administration indicating a positive response. After 3 hours, the subject is given a meal and discharged when medically stable. After a wash-out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects return to the CRC, and the procedure are repeated with each subject crossed over to the other treatment. A follow-up visit as a safety check is conducted 2-7 days following administration of the final dose of study drug.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With a Positive Glucose Response","timeFrame":"0 to 30 minutes post dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"G-Pen","deltaMin":76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lilly Glucagon","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34620618"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":76},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Headache"]}}
