Subjects who completed 12 weeks of double-blind treatment and the 30-day follow-up period in Study No. 6002-014 will undergo Screening and Baseline evaluations for eligibility for the study. Eligible subjects will be treated with istradefylline at a starting dose of 20 mg/d with an option for a dose adjustment to 40 mg/d at Week 12 based on the Investigator's judgment of each subject's response and tolerability. If deemed necessary, one unscheduled dose adjustment visit between Week 2 to Week 12 is allowed in accordance with clinical judgment of the Investigator. Subjects who had a dose adjustment to 40 mg/d can have their dose decreased to 20 mg/d by the Investigator at a second unscheduled dose adjustment visit if there are tolerability issues. The istradefylline dose should remain fixed between Week 26 to Week 52. Consultation with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor is required prior to any unscheduled dose adjustment visits. A subject may discontinue from the study at any time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Evaluation of the Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Oral Istradefylline (20mg or 40mg/Day [mg/d])","timeFrame":"From screening through to study completion, an average of 52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Safety Analysis Set","deltaMin":141,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["United States","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Israel","Italy","Poland","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":30,"n":239},"commonTop":["Dyskinesia","Fall","Parkinson's disease"]}}
