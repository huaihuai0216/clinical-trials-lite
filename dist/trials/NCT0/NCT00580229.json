The study will be useful as pilot data to establish that there are no different trends between the two treatment strategies at decreasing the frequency and severity of acute infusion reactions. It would also establish proof of principle that pre-treatment with oral prednisone is equally as efficacious as IV methylprednisolone.\n\nThe primary endpoint will be to assess the safety and tolerability of rituximab (Rituxan) in RA.\n\nBy showing that there are no differences in the frequency or severity of acute infusion reactions after rituximab when using pre-treatment with oral prednisone compared to I.V. methylprednisolone, we will establish proof of principle that oral prednisone is a viable alternative to I.V. methylprednisolone. Pre-treatment with oral prednisone would be a practical advantage for both the patient and the treating physician. The patient could self-administer this treatment at home thereby decreasing the time they would need to spend at the infusion center. Further, this dose of prednisone has fewer side effects than 100mg of methylprednisolone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Acute Infusion Reactions in the First 24 Hours After Oral Prednisone Pretreatment to Initial Rituximab Infusion","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Prednisone as a Pretreatment to Rituximab","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":50},"commonTop":["upper respiratory infection","sinusitis","headache","backache","diarrhea"]}}
