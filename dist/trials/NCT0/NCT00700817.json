The aim of this trial is to compare the effect on blood sugar control of liraglutide or sitagliptin, both in combination with metformin, in subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone.\n\nThe trial has been extended by 52 weeks. The extension will consist of two 26-week periods:\n\n1. Week 27-52 after randomisation\n\n   \\- All subjects will continue receiving sitagliptin or liraglutide at unchanged dose and dosing regimen.\n2. Week 53-78 after randomisation\n\n   * Subjects receiving sitagliptin at the end of week 52 after randomisation will discontinue sitagliptin and will be randomised 1:1 to liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or liraglutide 1.8 mg/day. Liraglutide will be initiated at a dose of 0.6 mg/day, and increased to 1.2 mg/day or 1.8 mg/day in weekly intervals.\n   * Subjects receiving liraglutide 1.2 mg/day or 1.8 mg/day at the end of week 52 after randomisation will continue the treatment at unchanged dose and dosing regimen. Trial completion is planned for June 2010.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 26","timeFrame":"Week 0, Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lira 1.2 mg -> Lira 1.2 mg -> Lira 1.2 mg","deltaMin":-1.24,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Lira 1.8 mg -> Lira 1.8 mg -> Lira 1.8 mg","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":0.06},{"arm":"Sita -> Sita","deltaMin":-0.9,"sd":0.07}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":166,"countries":["United States","Canada","Croatia","France","Germany","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Puerto Rico","Romania","Serbia and Montenegro","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20417856","21309842","21355967","22193143","21883806","21883438","22851600","22834986","22862847","23010561","23186975","25504028","26936426","23537458"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":221},"commonTop":["Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Diarrhoea","Vomiting"]}}
