Its active compound, pitavastatin has recently been approved by US FDA for indications of primary hypercholesterolemia and combined dyslipidaemia. It exhibits unique pharmacokinetic properties. Unlike atorvastatin which is metabolized by CYP3A4, metabolism of 1PC002 does not depend on CYP3A4. This multi-center study is conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of 1PC002 administered for 12 weeks is non-inferior to atorvastatin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Percentage Change From Baseline in LDL-C Level at Week 12.","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lipitor","deltaMin":-42.89,"sd":12.8},{"arm":"1PC002","deltaMin":-37.43,"sd":17.97}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":103},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Blood creatine phosphokinase","Myalgia","Back pain","Dizziness"]}}
