However, basal-bolus insulin is labor intensive and associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia, glycemic variability, weight gain and poor compliance. Thus, there is a critical need for a simpler treatment regimen that could overcome these limitations. IDegLira, a fixed-ratio combination (FRC) therapy consisting of insulin degludec and liraglutide, is an attractive option for this population given its proven benefits on glycemic control, weight and compliance. This study aims to show that a simpler regimen using a novel FRC agent (IDegLira) can improve glycemic control, decrease hypoglycemia, reduce the burden of diabetes care, and improve satisfaction/adherence in patients with poorly controlled T2D with HbA1c between ≥ 9-12%. This open-label, treat-to- target, two-arm parallel, controlled trial will randomize participants with T2D and HbA1c ≥ 9%, treated with oral anti-diabetic agents and/or basal insulin therapy to lDegLira or basal-bolus insulin for 26 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IDegLira","deltaMin":-3.18,"sd":2.29},{"arm":"Basal-Bolus Insulin","deltaMin":-3,"sd":1.79}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":72},"commonTop":["Nausea","Abdominal Pain","Diarrhea","Vomiting"]}}
