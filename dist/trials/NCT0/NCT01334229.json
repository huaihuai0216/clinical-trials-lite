Although clinical studies to date indicate that fasting lipid levels are minimally affected by DPP-IV inhibitor treatment \\[14-16\\], animal studies suggested that DPP-IV inhibition reduce intestinal triglycerides (TG) absorption and apolipoprotein (apo) production \\[17\\] and increased chylomicron catabolism \\[18\\]. Interestingly, a recent study supporting this hypothesis showed that vildagliptin therapy was able to reduce postprandial intestinal triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) particles in patients with type 2 diabetes \\[19\\]. Recently, our group has reported that sitagliptin treatment significantly reduced plasma apo B-48 and TG concentrations in the postprandial state. Moreover, animal studies showed that sitagliptin decreased intestinal secretion of intestinal apo B-48, mainly by increasing level of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 \\[20\\]. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of sitagliptin on the kinetics of TRL apo B-48 and in patients with type 2 diabetes. A possible reduction in postprandial atherogenic TRL apo B-48-containing lipoprotein levels by sitagliptin would add to therapeutic utility of this DPP-4 inhibitor and suggest the potential to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Measurement of Apolipoprotein B48 and Apolipoprotein B100 Production Rates With Stable Isotope During Postprandial Period","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":2.1,"sd":0.7},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.5,"sd":1.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":[]}}
