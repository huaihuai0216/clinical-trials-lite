Parents/legal guardians will be approached about study participation at the Anesthesia outpatient pre-visit. Attending Anesthesiologist will receive e-mail notification about potential subject participation the day before the scheduled surgery. Study lab (hepatic function panel) will be collected as soon as possible after anesthesia induction by anesthesia. Results will be reviewed by study team member and study drug will be ordered by study team if patient does not meet exclusion criteria. Study drug (IV acetaminophen or placebo) will be administered at the time of skin closure by anesthesia on completion of the surgical procedure (after randomization). Study drug will be administered every 6 hours for 2 days. Subjects will continue to receive standard of care with patient controlled analgesia (PCA) opiate therapy (morphine or hydromorphone) for analgesia as per the Pain Management Service. Pain scores, opiate (morphine equivalent) administered, requirements for treatment of opiate related side effects (treatment for nausea and itching), and certain post-operative characteristics will be measured for up to 4 days post-operatively (time to mobilization, time to diet advancement, time to discharge).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Opiate Requirement","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Saline Placebo","deltaMin":1.19,"sd":0.43},{"arm":"Intravenous Acetaminophen","deltaMin":1.01,"sd":0.32}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":28},"commonTop":[]}}
