A total of 189 military personnel with chronic insomnia, aged 18-65, will be recruited and randomized to receive 6-sessions (over 6 weeks) of CBTi (n=77), ICBTi (n=35), or a MC control (n=77) condition. The investigators will compare these three groups on subjective and objective measures of sleep. The CBTi and MC control groups will be compared on other variables of interest (e.g., depression, substance abuse, and PTSD symptoms) and predictors of outcomes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sleep Diary Sleep Efficiency","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment and 6 month follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"In-person CBT of Insomnia","deltaMin":73.2,"sd":2.2},{"arm":"Internet CBT of Insomnia","deltaMin":72.5,"sd":2.1},{"arm":"Minimal Contact","deltaMin":72.9,"sd":2.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29458705","34600107","31176888","33748530","30252077","29618098","28472528","32586427"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":75},"commonTop":["Cold/ flu","Pain, Arthritis","Allergies","Skin Rash","Other"]}}
