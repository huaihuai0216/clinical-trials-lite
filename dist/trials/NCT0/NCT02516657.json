Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that is usually diagnosed before the age of 20. Individuals with this disease are completely dependent on insulin for survival. While significant advances have been made in technological support for improving diabetes control, insulin remains the only effective treatment for Type 1 diabetes. Liraglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analog. This drug is approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in adults. This study will test the effect of liraglutide on blood sugar control in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Weekly Blood Glucose","timeFrame":"Visit 1 (Before Liraglutide) at baseline (Day 0) vs. Visit 2 (After Liraglutide) on Day 7;","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide 0.6 mg","deltaMin":187,"sd":35}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":[]}}
