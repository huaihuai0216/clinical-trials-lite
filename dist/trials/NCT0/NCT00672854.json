We do not know why TPN increases hospital complications, but it may be caused by the high sugar or fat content in TPN solutions.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of New Nosocomial Infections After 48 Hrs of Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Between the 2 Groups During Their Hospital Stay","timeFrame":"2 days after Parenteral Nutrition (up to 28 days post randomization)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Given Intralipid 20%","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) Given ClinOleic 20%","deltaMin":29,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22488002"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":49},"commonTop":["Vein irritation"]}}
