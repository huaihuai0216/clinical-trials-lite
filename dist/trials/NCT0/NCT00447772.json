The patients will be assigned to one of the two basic types of cervical dystonia, either predominantly rotational torticollis or predominantly laterocollis on the basis of clinical examination. This will determine which therapy is to be administered, using the clearly defined, structured injection protocols.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Total Score of the Tsui Rating Scale (Patient in Sitting Position) at the First On-treatment Visit (Week 4 or Week 12)","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 4 or Week 12 (up to 12 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rotatory Torticollis","deltaMin":-3.8,"sd":3.3},{"arm":"Laterocollis","deltaMin":-4,"sd":2.6},{"arm":"Dysport® 500 U - Total Study Population","deltaMin":-3.8,"sd":3.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.2552"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":106,"countries":["Austria","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23604344","22021883"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":515},"commonTop":["Muscular weakness","Dysphagia","Neck pain","Nasopharyngitis","Headache"]}}
