Ketamine is an anesthetic (a drug or agent used to decrease or eliminate the feeling of pain by putting you in an unconscious state). We will look at the brain using a machine that records the brain's electrical activity, called an electroencephalogram (EEG). We will assess how it impacts patient's pain responses.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Pain Intensity Pre- and Post-Ketamine Induction","timeFrame":"Approximately 125 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ketamine EEG Dynamics","deltaMin":7.9,"sd":0.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
