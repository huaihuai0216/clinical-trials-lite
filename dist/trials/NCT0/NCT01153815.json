Approximately 168 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will receive a single treatment session of intramuscular GSK1358820 (Botulinum Toxin Type A, also known as \"OnabotulinumtoxinA\" or \"Botox\") '200U or 240U (if thumb spasticity is present)' or placebo in a randomization ratio of 1:1. The subjects will be observed until 12 weeks post injection. Outcome measures include changes from baseline at every post injection visit as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) and Global Assessment Scale. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline at week 6 for wrist flexor muscle tone as measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale. Safety parameters will also be measured including adverse events, vital signs (pulse and blood pressure) and clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinanalysis).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline at Week 6 for Wrist Flexor Muscle Tone as Measured on the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 0) and Week 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.56,"sd":0.735},{"arm":"BTX 200 U","deltaMin":-1.21,"sd":0.936}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":83},"commonTop":["Hyperlipidemia","Epilepsy","Rash","Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased","Blood glucose increased"]}}
