The purpose is to evaluate the acceptability concerning a warming sensation effect and its potential benefit in the target population.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the warming sensation caused by the excipient IFF flavor 316 282, in a syrup containing paracetamol 500 mg + pseudoephedrine 30 mg per 30 ml syrup. The syrup contains (0.15% w/v) warming flavor.\n\nThe Secondary Objectives are to assess subject acceptability of the syrup and the safety and tolerability of the syrup. The study will be run in fifty-six (56) subjects suffering from symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) for 7 days or less, e.g. nasal congestion associated with colds and flu symptoms such as pain, headache and/or fever. Subjects must have one or more symptoms per category:\n\n1. mild to moderate body pain, headache, fever or sore throat\n2. nasal congestion (blocked nose) with or without rhinorrhea (runny nose) or sneezing Adolescents will be included in the study population","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Warming Sensation Caused by the Excipient IFF Flavor 316 282, in a Syrup Containing Paracetamol 500 mg + Pseudoephedrine 30 mg Per 30 ml Syrup","timeFrame":"1 minute","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Upper Respiratory Infections","deltaMin":34.2,"sd":25.51}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":56},"commonTop":["Somnolence"]}}
