At the time the study was designed, the standard treatment for people with HIV-1 and HCV coinfection included two drugs: pegylated-interferon alfa 2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of giving boceprevir (BOC) together with standard treatment in treating HCV infection in people with HIV-1 and HCV coinfection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at 24 Weeks After Treatment Discontinuation (SVR24)","timeFrame":"24 weeks after treatment discontinuation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HCV Treatment-Naive (Group A)","deltaMin":34.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"HCV Treatment-Experienced (Group B)","deltaMin":25.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":16,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":43,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17381715","20692693"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":32,"n":135},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Haemoglobin decreased","Platelet count decreased","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
