It is a viral infection that causes cough, throat, and airway swelling, making breathing difficult. Dexamethasone is a medication that helps to reduce swelling, making breathing easier for children. A standard dose of 0.6mg/kg is used in children. However, a lower amount (due to side effects of steroids in children) has been suggested. We will examine whether 25% less than the standard dose is equally effective in treating croup. Investigators will conduct a clinical study with the support of patients with lived experience (which, in this case, are the parents of the children) to better care for children with croup. If proven, this study can improve the outcome in children with croup.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Return Visits or Readmissions to the Hospital","timeFrame":"Seven days following initial presentation to the ED with croup.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"0.15mg/kg Dexamethasone","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Practice of 0.6mg/kg Dexamethasone","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":[]}}
