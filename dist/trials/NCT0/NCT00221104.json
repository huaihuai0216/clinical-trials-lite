The neuroprotective mechanism beyond cholesterol lowering should be expected to attenuate inflammation and atherosclerosis. The present study hypothesizes if pravastatin prevents recurrent stroke in the ischemic stroke patients with safety.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence Rate of Stroke and TIA","timeFrame":"up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pravastatin","deltaMin":2.56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":2.65,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.8234"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29511130","28924103","28135841"],"seeAlso":["http://jstars.umin.ne.jp"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":188,"n":780},"commonTop":[]}}
