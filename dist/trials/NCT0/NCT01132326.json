Droxidopa augments norepinephrine levels which should lead to improved cerebral perfusion following orthostatic challenge thereby reducing the symptoms of NOH. The present study will evaluate the long-term safety of droxidopa.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patients With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events","timeFrame":"up to 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Droxidopa","deltaMin":263,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":83,"n":350},"commonTop":["Fall","Urinary tract infection","Headache","Syncope","Dizziness"]}}
