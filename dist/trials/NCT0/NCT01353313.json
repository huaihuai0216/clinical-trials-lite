Infants will be randomized to receive hydrocortisone or placebo. This study will determine if hydrocortisone improves infants'survival without moderate or severe BPD and will be associated with improvement in survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 22 - 26 months corrected age.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Survival Without Moderate/Severe Physiologic Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)","timeFrame":"From day of randomization to 36 weeks post menstrual age","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hydrocortisone","deltaMin":332,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":349,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39543521","37256621","35320643"],"seeAlso":["http://neonatal.rti.org/","https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/ppb/Pages/overview.aspx"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":84,"n":398},"commonTop":["Respiratory failure","Hypertension","Adrenal insufficiency neonatal","Nosocomial infection","Hyperglycaemia"]}}
