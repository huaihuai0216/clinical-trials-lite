After discontinuation of study medication, assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of enrollment or until study termination. For those participants planning to continue treatment with MMB following the end of the study, the Early Study Drug Discontinuation (ESDD), 30-day, 12-Week, and survival follow-up visits are not required.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Splenic Response Rate at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Momelotinib (MMB)","deltaMin":57,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ruxolitinib (RUX)","deltaMin":64,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.014"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":114,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Japan","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40535755","39516087","37042865"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":49,"n":214},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Thrombocytopenia","Diarrhoea","Headache","Fatigue"]}}
