The investigators hypothesize that women who receive a paracervical block of combined ketorolac and lidocaine will experience less pain during the procedure based on a visual analog scale (VAS) compared to those who receive preoperative ibuprofen and a paracervical block with lidocaine alone.\n\nThis randomized, multi-site, placebo-controlled clinical trial will investigate the difference in perceived pain from first trimester surgical abortions using a paracervical block of combined ketorolac and lidocaine compared to preoperative ibuprofen and paracervical block with lidocaine alone. A total of fifty women who are seeking elective surgical abortions of intrauterine pregnancies less than 11 0/7 weeks' gestation will be recruited from Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Planned Parenthood of Maryland in Baltimore, Maryland and Planned Parenthood Columbia-Willamette in Portland, Oregon. Pain before, during, and after surgical abortion will be measured using a 100-mm VAS.\n\nThe primary outcome of interest is the mean difference in pain level from preoperative baseline to time after cervical dilation comparing the treatment groups. If the investigators see greater pain reduction associated with the paracervical block of lidocaine and ketorolac, adoption of this regimen may improve pain management during first trimester surgical abortions. If combined ketorolac and lidocaine when administered as a paracervical block is proven to be efficacious, the need for additional analgesia in first trimester surgical abortions can be minimized.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Level of Pain During Specific Time Intervals Throughout D&C Procedure.","timeFrame":"Baseline, Speculum Insertion, at Paracervical block injection, After dilation, End of procedure, 30 minutes after procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Paracervical Block With Lidocaine","deltaMin":52.2,"sd":20.8},{"arm":"Paracervical Block With Ketorolac and Lidocaine","deltaMin":51.7,"sd":25.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.94"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.49"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.03"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.7"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".52"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19935022"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":["reported symptoms"]}}
