COVID-19 coagulopathy is characterized by elevated D-dimer, an indicator of fibrin formation and clot lysis, and a mildly prolonged prothrombin time, suggestive of coagulation consumption. To date, it seems that COVID-19 coagulopathy manifests with thromboembolism, thus anticoagulation may be of benefit. We propose to conduct a parallel pragmatic multi-centre open-label randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of therapeutic anticoagulation compared to standard care in hospitalized patients admitted for COVID-19 with an elevated D-dimer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Composite Outcome of ICU Admission, Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation, Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, or All-cause Death up to 28 Days.","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Therapeutic Anticoagulation","deltaMin":37,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Care","deltaMin":52,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35244208","34649864","34268513","33691765","33502773"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":228,"n":228},"commonTop":["Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection"]}}
