Excess androgen production by the ovary is stimulated by increased pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in this disorder. The investigators hypothesize that in PCOS women ovarian theca cells, which are responsible for androgen synthesis, are more sensitive to LH stimulation compared to that of theca cells from normal women. To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to conduct a dose-response study in which androgen responses to multiple doses of human chorionic gonadotgropin (hCG), an LH surrogate, will be assessed in PCOS and normal women.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Serum 17OHP Responses to hCG","timeFrame":"24 hrs post dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PCOS","deltaMin":2,"sd":0.3},{"arm":"Normal","deltaMin":1.2,"sd":0.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17893687","18285408","16720653","16804036","15644405","15467530","27473350","25313914","25303490","24188875","21270326"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
