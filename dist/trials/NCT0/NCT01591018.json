Patients will be randomized - subgroup 1 will undergo a 40-240minute non-diagnostic TCD monitoring during CS, subgroup 2 will undergo interventions without TCD monitoring.\n\nThe aim of the project is a concordance with the aim No 1 of the Resort Program of a Research and Development: \"Improvement of quality of life of patients using the modern therapeutic methods but with relative small positive effect of quality of life\". The aim of the project is in concordance with a priority of announced public grant competition: \"Development of the new therapeutic methods of cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary heart disease and stroke\". Confirmation of our hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during CS with consecutive reduction of the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CS in patients. We can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for CS can be treated using these methods in the future.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number od Participants With New Brain Infarction in the Monitored MCA Territory Detected Using MRI","timeFrame":"24 hours after intervention","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cardiac Surgery With Sonolysis","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cardiac Surgery Without Sonolysis","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Czechia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27196464"],"seeAlso":["http://fno.cz","http://mzcr.cz"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":42,"n":60},"commonTop":[]}}
