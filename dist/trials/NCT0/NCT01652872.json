Anemic subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and not on dialysis will be randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 dosing strategies to evaluate the proportion of subjects receiving at least one red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In the haemoglobin (Hb)-based titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to maintain Hb â‰¥ 10.0 grams/deciliter (g/dL). In the fixed dose group, subjects will receive a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa. Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses, and protocol specified Hb concentrations will be blinded. Subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years from the date of randomization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants in Receipt of 1 or More RBC Transfusions","timeFrame":"From randomization until the end of study, up to week 101.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hb-Based Titration Group","deltaMin":24.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fixed Dose Group","deltaMin":24.14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":30},"locations":{"siteCount":249,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33288629"],"seeAlso":["http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":190,"n":377},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Urinary tract infection","Oedema peripheral","Hyperkalaemia","Anaemia"]}}
