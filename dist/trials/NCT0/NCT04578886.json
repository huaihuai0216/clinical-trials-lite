Various pharmacologic agents including dopamine antagonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, melatonin, antipsychotics, alpha-2 agonists, and glutamate antagonists are used for treatment of delirium in the ICU despite the lack of clear evidence of efficacy.Since there is no evidence-based pharmacologic treatment of ICU delirium, current therapy is focused on non-pharmacologic prevention techniques and pharmacologic agents are used once delirium is established. Guanfacine, an alpha-2 agonist, has been identified as a potential medication that may be of benefit in the treatment of delirium. The purpose of this study to investigate the effects of guanfacine versus placebo on delirium in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU and to determine whether guanfacine along with standard of care reduces the duration of delirium, compared to standard of care alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Days Without Delirium","timeFrame":"From the time of ICU admission up to 14 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.54,"sd":3.14},{"arm":"Guanfacine","deltaMin":3.38,"sd":3.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.22"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0150"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":[]}}
