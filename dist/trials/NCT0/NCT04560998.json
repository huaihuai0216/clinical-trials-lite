Participants will either get semaglutide or placebo (\"dummy\") medicine - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Semaglutide is a medicine for type 2 diabetes that can be prescribed by doctors in some countries. Participants will get the study medicine (semaglutide or placebo) in a pre-filled pen for injection. Participants must inject it once a week into the stomach area, thigh, or upper arm, at any time of the day. The study will last for about 59 weeks. Participants will have 8 clinic visits and 1 phone call with the study doctor. At some clinic visits, participants will have blood tests. At some visits participants will also do a treadmill test to measure how far they can walk. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Maximum Walking Distance on a Constant Load Treadmill Test","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), end of treatment (week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide","deltaMin":1.21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.08,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":124,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","Czechia","Denmark","Germany","Greece","Hungary","India","Japan","Latvia","Malaysia","Norway","Poland","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40169145"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":74,"n":396},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nausea"]}}
