It targets CD22, a molecule on the surface of essentially all hairy cell leukemia cells. Moxetumomab pasudotox binds to CD22, goes into the cell, and releases a toxin which kills the cell. In a phase I trial it had activity in relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia with safety profile supporting further clinical study (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22355053). This is a phase III multicenter trial designed to confirm these results.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Durable Complete Response (CR) Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review","timeFrame":"Full disease assessment (CBC, bone marrow and imaging) at end of treatment (EOT; up to 24 weeks) and post EOT Day 181; CBC monthly for 6 months post EOT, every 3 months post Day 181 for first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter (approximately 6 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Moxetumomab Pasudotox 40 µg/kg","deltaMin":36.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Norway","Poland","Serbia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["7820038","17237035","16990105","22355053","30030507","33627164","31298972"],"seeAlso":["http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?A_2013-C-0106.html","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=3161&filename=CD-ON-CAT-8015-1053_current_SAP_redacted_PDF-A.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=3161&filename=protocol-cd-on-cat-8015-1053-amendment-9_redacted_PDF-A.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":80},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Nausea","Fatigue","Headache","Pyrexia"]}}
