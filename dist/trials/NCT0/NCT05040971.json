The \"dummy\" medicine looks like semaglutide but has no effect on the body.\n\nIn addition to taking the medicine, participants will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more physically active and what participants can do to lose weight.\n\nParticipants will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment they get is decided by chance. Participants are 2 times as likely to get semaglutide as \"dummy\" medicine.\n\nParticipants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm.\n\nThe study will last for about 19 months. Participants have to take the study medicine every week for the first 12 months. The last 7 months participants will not take any medication.\n\nParticipants will have 14 clinic visits and 1 phone call with the study staff. At 9 of the clinic visits Participants will have blood samples taken. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight (Percentage [%])","timeFrame":"From randomisation (week 0) to end of treatment (week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-14.4,"sd":7.9},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.7,"sd":4.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["Canada","Denmark","Finland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39089293"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":138},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nausea","Constipation","Diarrhoea","Vomiting"]}}
