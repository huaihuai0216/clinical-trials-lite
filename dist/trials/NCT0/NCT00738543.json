Alternatives for povidone-iodine, which is the most commonly used agent, are costly or ineffective. To have more options, this study is needed. The investigators want to know if there are difference between the use of 10% sodium hypochlorite or 10% povidone-iodine for skin antisepsis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Bacterial Count of Skin Cultures for the 10% Povidone-iodine Period","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Whole Group","deltaMin":231,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":48},"commonTop":[]}}
