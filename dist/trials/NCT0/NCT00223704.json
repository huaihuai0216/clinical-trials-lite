CPB is associated with significant morbidity including the transfusion of allogenic blood products, inflammation and hemodynamic instability. In fact, approximately 20% of all blood products transfused are associated with coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. Transfusion of allogenic blood products is associated with well-documented morbidity and increased mortality after cardiac surgery. Enhanced fibrinolysis contributes to increased blood product transfusion in the perioperative period. The current proposal tests the central hypothesis that endogenous bradykinin contributes to the hemodynamic, fibrinolytic and inflammatory response to CPB and that bradykinin receptor antagonism will reduce hypotension, inflammation and transfusion requirements. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 we will test the hypothesis that the fibrinolytic and inflammatory response to CPB differ during ACE inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism. In SPECIFIC AIM 2 we will test the hypothesis that bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism attenuates the hemodynamic, fibrinolytic, and inflammatory response to CPB. In SPECIFIC AIM 3 we will test the hypothesis that bradykinin B2 receptor antagonism reduces the risk of allogenic blood product transfusion in patients undergoing CPB. These studies promise to provide important information regarding the effects of drugs that interrupt the RAS and generate new strategies to reduce morbidity in patients undergoing CPB.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Allogenic Blood Product Transfusion Risk","timeFrame":"Patients were followed for the duration of hospital stay, an average of 6 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":47.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Aminocaproic Acid Group","deltaMin":56.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"HOE 140 Group","deltaMin":52.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.72"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23361105"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":38},"commonTop":["New onset postoperative atrial fibrillation","Acute kidney injury","Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation (>24 hours)","Placement of permanent pacemaker"]}}
