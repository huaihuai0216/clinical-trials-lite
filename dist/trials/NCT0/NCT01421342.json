The primary objective is to compare the acute (up to 12 weeks) treatment effectiveness of augmenting an antidepressant with aripiprazole or with bupropion-slow release (SR) vs. switching treatment to bupropion-SR monotherapy on symptom remission in Veterans with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have not achieved optimal response after an adequate trial on antidepressant (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor \\[SSRI\\] or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor \\[SNRI\\] or mirtazapine) monotherapy. The secondary objectives are to compare the acute (up to 12 weeks) and long term (up to 36 weeks) efficacy, safety, effects on functioning, suicidality, quality of life, anxiety and other associated symptoms, costs and cost-effectiveness of each of the three treatments.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Protocol Remission of Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder","timeFrame":"During acute phase (12 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Switching: Bupropion-SR","deltaMin":114,"sd":null},{"arm":"Augmenting: Antidepressant + Bupropion-SR","deltaMin":136,"sd":null},{"arm":"Augmenting: Antidepressant + Aripiprazole","deltaMin":146,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.076"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.018"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.46"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26279130","27479536","28697253","40742171","35366613","33225492","32603560","30947531","30695291"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":52,"n":511},"commonTop":["Nervous system disorders","Psychiatric disorders","Gastrointestinal disorders","Metabolism and nutrition disorders","General disorders and administration site conditions"]}}
