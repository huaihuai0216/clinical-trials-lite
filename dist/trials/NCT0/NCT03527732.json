This study aims at providing evidence on the efficacy and safety of co-administered albendazole and ivermectin versus albendazole monotherapy (standard of care) against whipworm (T. trichiura) infections in children and adults (6-60 years).\n\nThe efficacy of the treatment and potential extended effects on follow-up prevalence will be determined 14-21 days, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment by collecting another two stool samples. The cure rate will be calculated as the percentage of egg-positive subjects at baseline who become egg-negative after treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants T.
