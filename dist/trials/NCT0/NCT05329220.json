Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ABNCoV2 or Comirnaty.\n\nPart B is designed to collect ABNCoV2 safety and tolerability data from a larger population of adult subjects, as well as additional immunogenicity data from a subset. Part B involves vaccination with the same single 100 µg dose of ABNCoV2 in the same population of adult subjects as the randomized component, and subjects will similarly be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to whether they have completed primary vaccination only or primary plus booster vaccination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Neutralizing Antibody Titers Against the SARS-CoV-2 Index Virus (Wuhan Wild Type Isolate) at 2 Weeks After Trial Vaccination","timeFrame":"2 weeks after the single trial vaccination occurring on Day 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part A Cohort 1 ABNCoV2","deltaMin":1018.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part A Cohort 1 Comirnaty","deltaMin":1060.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part A Cohort 2 ABNCoV2","deltaMin":1259,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part A Cohort 2 Comirnaty","deltaMin":1619.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.6350"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":57,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Denmark"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":34},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Pharyngitis"]}}
