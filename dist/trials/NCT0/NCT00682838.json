Because of disappointingly low adherence to the gold-standard treatment (continuous positive airway pressure therapy - CPAP), the Institute of Medicine has stated that new adherence strategies are needed that improve the quality of care, reduce social and economic costs, and help OSA patients live happier, healthier, and more productive lives through improved clinical management. The combination of a self-management approach along with emerging wireless technologies has strong potential to increase treatment adherence and improve outcomes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Nightly CPAP Adherence","timeFrame":"3 mos","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Self-management","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":1.8},{"arm":"Telemonitored Care","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":2.3},{"arm":"SM+TC","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":2.2},{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":2.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.50"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":65},"commonTop":[]}}
