Mifepristone would be given 24 hours prior to abortion, and misoprostol 400 mcg would be administered buccally 2 hours prior to abortion. Osmotic dilators are the method currently used in our institution, and are placed 24 hours prior to abortion. The primary outcome will be the length of the procedure. Secondary outcomes will include amount of dilation achieved, ease of procedure, participant's assessment of discomfort before mifepristone or dilators, discomfort during the abortion procedure, acceptability to participants, and acceptability to staff.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Length of Procedure","timeFrame":"Subjects will be followed from the administration of mifepristone/misoprostol or laminaria, until the end of their procedure, a total of two days.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mifepristone + Misoprostol","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Osmotic Dilators","deltaMin":13.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":[]}}
