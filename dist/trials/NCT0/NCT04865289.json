It is hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib will be superior to chemotherapy for progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR). It is also hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib will be superior to chemotherapy for overall survival (OS).\n\nAs of Amendment 7 eligible participants on study completion will be able to transition to an extension study, if available, in which they can continue to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy, lenvatinib monotherapy, or a combination of both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib as received in the parent study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in Mismatch Repair Proficient (pMMR) Participants","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 45 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":10.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paclitaxel + Carboplatin","deltaMin":10.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":73},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Platelet count decreased","White blood cell count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Proteinuria"]}}
