The topical steroid eye drops are aimed at reducing swelling in the retina, until the collateral vessels have a chance to develop.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With An Improvement in Vision, as Measured by an Increase of 15 Letters on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS) Vision Chart.","timeFrame":"one year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Prospective Active Treatment","deltaMin":63,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
