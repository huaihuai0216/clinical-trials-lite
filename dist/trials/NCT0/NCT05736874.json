Participants will receive either study drug or placebo. They will self-report any new or worsening symptoms or medical events they may experience while taking study drug or placebo. This study is intended to be all remote with no in person visits, unless the study team feels it is in the best interest of a participant to see them in person.\n\nPrior and current drug arms are listed on clinicaltrials.gov and will be updated with the activation of any new drug arms. This protocol was originally registered under NCT04885530. Per recent guidance on reporting master protocol research programs (MPRPs), a separate record for Arm C was created.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Sustained Recovery in Days","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm C - Fluticasone","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C - Placebo","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":87,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":656},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Hypoxia","Accelerated hair loss","Anxiety","Chest tightness"]}}
