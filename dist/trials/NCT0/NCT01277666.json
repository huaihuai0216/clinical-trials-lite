Efficacy will be assessed by proportion of subjects achieving response, defined as a decrease in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of at least 100 points (clinical response). Clinical remission (CDAI score less than 150 points) will be evaluated as a key secondary endpoint. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG). Population pharmacokinetics will evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes assessments will include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2), EQ-5D and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-CD (WPAI-CD) and receipt of disability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Response at Week 12","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":25.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"GSK1605786A 500 mg Once Daily","deltaMin":27.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"GSK1605786A 500 mg Twice Daily","deltaMin":27.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.546"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.648"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":219,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Poland","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":202},"commonTop":["Headache","Crohn's disease","Nasopharyngitis","Abdominal pain","Nausea"]}}
