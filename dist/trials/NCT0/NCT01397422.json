The novel pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) higher amantadine plasma concentrations during daytime hours when dyskinesia as well as motor and non-motor symptoms of PD are most problematic, ii) low amantadine plasma concentrations overnight, which may reduce the sleep disturbances and vivid dreams occasionally associated with amantadine, and iii) a reduced initial rate of rise in plasma concentration, which is expected to improve overall tolerability of amantadine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) Total Score From Baseline to Week 8","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 1) and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-6.7,"sd":2.68},{"arm":"ADS-5102 (260 mg)","deltaMin":-12.3,"sd":2.88},{"arm":"ADS-5102 (340 mg)","deltaMin":-17.9,"sd":2.82},{"arm":"ADS-5102 (420 mg)","deltaMin":-16.7,"sd":2.88}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG002","p":"0.0051"},{"comp":"OG003","p":"0.0131"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.1595"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Constipation","Dizziness","Fall","Dry mouth","Hallucination, visual"]}}
