The hypothesis to be tested is that dronabinol will be effective and well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania and/or skin-picking disorder compared to placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of disabling disorders that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"NIMH Trichotillomania Symptom Severity Scale (NIMH-TSS)","timeFrame":"Assessed every two weeks up to 10 weeks, baseline data reported","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dronabinol","deltaMin":12.38,"sd":3.15},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":10.63,"sd":3.42}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17194265","17727824","21590520","20819990","2308954","9204917","11976704","14526074","15078543","20554863","16052037","18632932","19581567","19051237","7730690","9223837","2761586","8657844","28779593","34825898","34582562"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":["Sedation","Light headed/dizzy","Cognitive blunting, attentional problems","Dry mouth","High (easy laughing, elation, heightened awareness)"]}}
