After 12 weeks of observation from disease onset, participants will receive one of the following regimens: (1) a 24-week course of PEG-IFN monotherapy (PEG-IFN 24); or (2) a 12-week course of PEG-IFN monotherapy (PEG-IFN-12); or (3) a 12-week course of PEG-IFN in combination with ribavirin (PEG-IFN + RVB 12). After the treatment period, participants will enter a 12-month follow-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Sustained Response (SR) at the End of the 6-month Follow-up Period","timeFrame":"Evaluated at the end of 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PEG-IFN 24","deltaMin":23,"sd":null},{"arm":"PEG-IFN 12","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"PEG-IFN + RVB 12","deltaMin":21,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["24442928"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":43},"commonTop":["Leukopenia","Pyrexia","Granulocytopenia","Arthralgia","Headache"]}}
