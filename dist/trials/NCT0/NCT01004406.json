The study will also investigate whether this intensive approach can help increase the presence of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), stem cells that have been shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) events in ACS patients. This study has II phases and FDA approval for phase II has been received.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in the Total Atheroma Volume of the Target Coronary Artery From Baseline to 12 Weeks Post-PCI as Assessed Via Intravascular Ultrasound With Virtual Histology (IVUS-VH)","timeFrame":"baseline and 12-week follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensive LDL-lowering Therapy (ILLT)","deltaMin":-3.7,"sd":18.52},{"arm":"Standard Statin Monotherapy (SMT)","deltaMin":10.79,"sd":35.23}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"31 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32791950"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":21},"commonTop":["Chest pain","Sinusitis","Dizziness","Otitis externa","Musculoskeletal pain"]}}
