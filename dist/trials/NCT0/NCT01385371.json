Participants will receive either the sublingual grass tablet or a placebo tablet during the study. It is expected that those participants receiving the active sublingual grass tablet will have less hayfever symptoms and need less medications to treat hayfever symptoms during the grass pollen season.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Total Combined Rhinoconjunctivitis Daily Symptom Score (DSS) and Rhinoconjunctivitis Daily Medication Score (DMS) Over the Entire Grass Pollen Season (GPS)","timeFrame":"Entire GPS (expected average duration of 5 to 6 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SCH 697243","deltaMin":3.24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.22,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["24468255","26507709","25685162"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":753},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Throat irritation","Upper respiratory tract infection","Oral pruritus","Headache"]}}
