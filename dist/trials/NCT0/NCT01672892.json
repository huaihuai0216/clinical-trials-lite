Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different methods of radiation and their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating endometrial and cervical cancer after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Acute Gastrointestinal Toxicity, as Measured by Change in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) Bowel Domain Score at 5 Weeks From the Start of Pelvic Radiation","timeFrame":"Baseline and week 5 of RT","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy","deltaMin":-18.6,"sd":18.7},{"arm":"Standard Radiation Therapy","deltaMin":-23.6,"sd":19.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0476"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":137,"countries":["United States","Canada","Hong Kong","Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32073955","31104905","29989857","35960897"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":125},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Fatigue","Nausea","Abdominal pain","Urinary frequency"]}}
