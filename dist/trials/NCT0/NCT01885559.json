Participants will be recruited and enrolled, either to Study A or B, over the first three years. Participants enrolled in Study B will be followed for five-to-eight years, with the average length of follow-up being six and a half years.\n\nCombination therapy will use angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB). Monotherapy will use ACE-I alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With 50% Reduction of Baseline eGFR, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD, Initiation of Dialysis or Preemptive Transplant), or Death.","timeFrame":"Patients followed for 5-8 years with average of 6.5 years follow up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ACE-I + Placebo","deltaMin":116,"sd":null},{"arm":"ACE-I + ARB","deltaMin":115,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.58"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39356039","37250503","25399731"],"seeAlso":["http://www.pkdcure.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":88,"n":242},"commonTop":["Hyperkalemia","Acute Kidney Injury"]}}
