Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Giving combination chemotherapy together with cetuximab as first treatment after diagnosis of a metastatic colorectal cancer ('1st-line' treatment) may improve the treatment efficacy. However, it is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with cetuximab is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone. This open-label trial investigates the effectiveness of cetuximab in combination with a standard and effective chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil (5FU)/Folinic acid (FA) plus irinotecan) for metastatic colorectal cancer in first-line setting, compared to the same chemotherapy alone on patient expressing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor.\n\nPatients expressing this EGF Receptor will be randomly assign in one of the 2 groups to either receive the combination chemotherapy alone or with cetuximab (open-label study) and will then be treated until progression of the disease or unacceptable toxicity occur. Regular efficacy assessments (every 8 weeks) based on imaging will be performed throughout the study together with regular safety assessments (e.g. safety labs). An independent Safety Board of experts will also monitor safety data.\n\nAfter participant discontinuation from the trial, regular updates on further treatments and survival status will be requested from the investigator.\n\nThe entire study (from the first patient entering the study to the last collect of follow-up information) is 4-5 years long.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time - Independent Review Committee (IRC) Assessments","timeFrame":"Time from randomisation to disease progression, death or last tumour assessment, reported between day of first patient randomised, 10 Aug 2004, until cut-off date, 27 July 2006","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cetuximab Plus FOLFIRI","deltaMin":8.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"FOLFIRI Alone","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0479"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":154,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Chile","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Singapore","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19339720","30657405","27722750","23265711"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":263,"n":600},"commonTop":["DIARRHOEA","NAUSEA","NEUTROPENIA","ALOPECIA","VOMITING"]}}
