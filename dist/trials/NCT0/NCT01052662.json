The study seeks to determine if combined treatment of memantine and buprenorphine may provide shorter-term treatment for opioid dependence.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change of Opioid Use From Week 1 to 13","timeFrame":"Weekly from week 1 to 13","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Memantine 30mg/Day + Buprenorphine","deltaMin":0,"sd":0},{"arm":"Memantine 15mg/Day + Buprenorphine","deltaMin":0.27,"sd":0.1},{"arm":"Memantine 0mg/Day + Buprenorphine","deltaMin":0.39,"sd":0.14}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"=0.00874"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["Pain","Nausea","Vivid Dreams","Constipation","Upper Respiratory Intection"]}}
