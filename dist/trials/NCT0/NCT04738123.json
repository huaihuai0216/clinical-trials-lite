The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice daily \\[BID\\]) versus placebo in reducing Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate improvement in disease severity and symptoms, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 5","timeFrame":"From baseline up to Week 5","effectByArm":[{"arm":"KarXT","deltaMin":-20.6,"sd":1.584},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-12.2,"sd":1.552}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40215379","40212458","40047530","38691387"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":125},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Dyspepsia","Constipation","Vomiting"]}}
