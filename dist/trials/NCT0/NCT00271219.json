Methadone is a drug that is commonly used for treating opioid dependence. However, its use by a pregnant woman can cause severe withdrawal symptoms in a newborn because of the prenatal exposure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of buprenorphine, another drug, versus methadone in reducing withdrawal symptoms in children born to opioid-dependent women.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Child's Head Circumference Measurement (Measured at Birth)","timeFrame":"birth","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A Methadone","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"B Buprenorphine","deltaMin":33.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Austria","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23786504","23523131","23279924","23106931","23106930","23106929","23106928","23106927","23106926","23106925","23106924","23106923","22088886","21142534"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":89},"commonTop":["gastrointestinal","respiratory","musculoskeletal","neuromuscular","hematopoietic or lymphatic symptoms"]}}
