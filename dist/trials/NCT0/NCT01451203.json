Following a year of treatment with CZP plus MTX treatment, CZP will be discontinued, and the subjects will be monitored for one more year (the follow-up period) to investigate the sustainability of efficacy of CZP during the MTX monotherapy for exploratory purposes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 52","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PBO + MTX","deltaMin":1.58,"sd":4.86},{"arm":"CZP + MTX","deltaMin":0.36,"sd":2.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28153828","26139005"],"seeAlso":["https://www.astellasclinicalstudyresults.com/hcp/study.aspx?ID=CDP870-275-11-001/1226-CL-B001"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":157},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Hepatic function abnormal","Nausea","Stomatitis","Pharyngitis"]}}
