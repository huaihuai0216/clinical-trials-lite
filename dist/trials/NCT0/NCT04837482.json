Adverse events and change in disease symptoms will be assessed.\n\nAGN-190584 is an investigational formulation of pilocarpine for treating symptoms associated with presbyopia as a topical, once-daily eyedrop delivered by a proprietary vehicle.\n\nThis crossover study consists of two parts. Part 1 consists of Visit 2 and Visit 3, and Part 2 consists of Visit 4 and Visit 5. Approximately half of the participants will receive AGN-190584 at Visit 2 through Visit 3 (Sequence 1 participants) and the remaining participants (Sequence 2 participants) will receive AGN-190584 at Visit 4 through Visit 5. All participants will receive AGN-190584 at home as instructed. Approximately 54 adult participants with presbyopia will be enrolled at 1 site in Australia.\n\nTreatment duration is expected to be no more than 71 days. In Part 1, at Visit 2 (Day 1) and at home as instructed for 7 to 14 days, Sequence 1 participants will receive 1 eyedrop of AGN-190584 in each eye and Sequence 2 participants will receive 1 eyedrop of vehicle in each eye. All participants will have a driving assessment at Visit 3 (Day 8 to 15). In Part 2, at Visit 4 (Day 15 to 57) and at home as instructed for 7 to 14 days, Sequence 2 participants will receive 1 eyedrop of AGN-190584 in each eye and Sequence 1 participants will receive 1 eyedrop of vehicle in each eye. All participants will have a driving assessment at Visit 5 (Day 22 to 71).\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effects of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, asking about side effects, and completing questionnaires.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Composite Driving Z Score Approximately 1 Hour After Study Intervention Instillation","timeFrame":"One hour after study intervention instillation at Visit 3 (Day 8 to 15) and at Visit 5 (Day 22 to 71)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vehicle","deltaMin":0.118,"sd":0.4011},{"arm":"AGN-190584","deltaMin":-0.121,"sd":0.4503}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Australia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38044272"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":["VISUAL IMPAIRMENT","HEADACHE","EYE PAIN","VISION BLURRED","DRY EYE"]}}
