As trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) is frequently given to adults, it is important to show that both vaccines can safely be given together without affecting the immune response (body's ability to protect against disease).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"TIV Comparisons: Percentage of Participants Achieving at Least a 4-fold Increase in the Titer of the Standard Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HAI)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 1 month after TIV vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC+TIV","deltaMin":80.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo+TIV","deltaMin":78.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":576},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Headache","Pain (any)","Pain (mild)","New muscle pain"]}}
