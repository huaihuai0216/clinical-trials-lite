After signing consent there can be up to 28 days before starting the treatment during which time a number of tests will be carried out which will include tumor evaluations and medical history. The following tests and evaluations will have to be done within 7 days of the start of treatment,on Day 1 of every cycle and at the end of study: Electrocardiogram, blood tests, patient quality of life questionnaires and a complete physical exam and vital signs. Treatment will be given in 21 day cycles with sorafenib/placebo to be taken every day for 21 days and capecitabine to be taken for the first 14 days. Patients will come in weekly for the first 6 weeks and then on Day1 for every cycle after the first 2 cycles. During the weekly visits the subjects will be check for any side effects and blood draws will happen for the study on Day 1 of each cycle.
