This trial includes three arms, one control arm (PEG2b + RBV for 48 weeks) and two experimental arms (PEG2b + RBV + boceprevir). One of the experimental arms, Arm 3, consists of treatment with all three drugs for 44 weeks after the lead-in. The other experimental arm, Arm 2, consists of all three drugs for 32 weeks after the lead-in. Participants in Arm 2 who were undetectable for HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8 will complete treatment at that point. Those who were not undetectable for HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 8 will receive an additional 12 weeks of PEG2b + RBV + boceprevir placebo. It is hypothesized that the addition of a third active anti-HCV drug may lead to more rapid viral response than therapy with two drugs, and therefore, the addition of boceprevir to PEG2b plus RBV therapy after a 4-week lead-in period may allow for both increased rates of SVR and shorter treatment durations (in some populations) than treatment with peginterferon plus RBV alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) Rate in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population.","timeFrame":"At Follow-up Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo+PEG2b+RBV, x 44 Weeks","deltaMin":21.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Boceprevir+PEG2b+RBV, Response Guided Therapy","deltaMin":58.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Boceprevir+PEG2b+RBV, x 44 Weeks","deltaMin":66.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["22626609","21449784"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":80},"commonTop":["FATIGUE","HEADACHE","NAUSEA","ANAEMIA","DYSGEUSIA"]}}
