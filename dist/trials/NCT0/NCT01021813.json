Participants will be randomized to receive suvorexant or placebo for a 12-month double-blind (DB) Treatment Phase. Participants who complete the 12-month DB Treatment Phase will enter a 2-month DB Randomized Discontinuation Phase. At the time of initial randomization, participants assigned to receive suvorexant during the initial 12-month Treatment Phase will be simultaneously randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either suvorexant or placebo during the 2-month Randomized Discontinuation Phase. Participants randomized to receive placebo in the initial 12-month Treatment Phase will continue to receive placebo during the 2-month Randomized Discontinuation Phase.\n\nThe first 3 nights of the Randomized Discontinuation Phase are referred to as the Run-Out Phase, and will assess rebound and withdrawal.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Cataplexy Adverse Events (AEs) During the Double-Blind (DB) Treatment Phase","timeFrame":"From the first day of study treatment up to 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Suvorexant","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28427826","28265715","24680372"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":521},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Dizziness"]}}
