The vaccine composition will be based on the WHO-recommended influenza strains for the 2013/2014 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. The results of this study are intended to support the use of this vaccine in future influenza seasons if the recommended vaccine composition remains the same, in compliance with the requirements of the current EU recommendations for clinical trials related to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Single Radial Hemolysis (SRH) Areas ≥25mm2, Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After Receiving One Dose of TIVc","timeFrame":"Day 22 (vaccination is on day 1)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TIVc (≥18 to ≤ 60 Years)","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"TIVc (≥ 61 Years)","deltaMin":41,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":63},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Headache","Fatigue","Injection site induration"]}}
