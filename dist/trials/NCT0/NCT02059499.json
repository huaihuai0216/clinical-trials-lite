Biological therapies, such as imiquimod, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether imiquimod or fluorouracil is more effective than observation in treating high-grade anal squamous skin lesions.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response in 5-FU Arm and Observation Arm Using ITT Population","timeFrame":"At week 20","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm C (Observation)","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Fluorouracil)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1877"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40801169"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":18},"commonTop":["ANOREXIA","HYPOGLYCEMIA","GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS (Anal spasms)","MUSCULOSKELETAL AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER - (pain)","HEADACHE"]}}
