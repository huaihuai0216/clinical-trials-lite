Study visits occurred at 4 week intervals for 16 weeks; the key measure of efficacy was the 6-minute walk test. Study procedures included routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease evaluation, and exercise tests. One optional substudy was also a part of FREEDOM-C at select centers - a hemodynamic substudy with a right heart catheterization at Baseline and Week 16.\n\nPatients who completed all assessments for 16-weeks were also eligible to enter an open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 16 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Arm","deltaMin":362.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active","deltaMin":362.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.072"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22628490"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":176},"commonTop":["headache","nausea","diarrhea","flushing","pain in jaw"]}}
