Patients were eligible to participate in this study if they are currently experiencing an inadequate response to a stable dose of a non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). Patients received 8 mg/kg tocilizumab \\[RoActemra/Actemra\\] as an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 6 infusions. The anticipated time on study treatment was 24 weeks. The target sample size was 50-200 patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) Low Disease Activity","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 24 (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab","deltaMin":27.59,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab + MTX","deltaMin":18.42,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["Egypt"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":29},"commonTop":["Low density lipoprotein increased","Blood chloride increased","Blood cholesterol increased","Blood calcium decreased","Blood sodium increased"]}}
