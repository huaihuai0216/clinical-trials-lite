The study assesses one factor related to nicotine patches with 3 levels: sending patches directly from the Helpline, providing vouchers that can be redeemed for patches, and usual care. A second factor is counseling plus materials versus materials only. This proposed study has the following specific aims:\n\n1. To demonstrate that a voucher for free nicotine patches will increase the quit rate for smokers who do not have access to free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)\n2. To demonstrate that sending patches directly from a quitline would outperform sending vouchers for free NRT, since the vouchers impose an additional barrier to those who want to quit\n3. To determine the effect of telephone counseling in the context of nicotine patch distribution and if any interaction effects exist between counseling and patch conditions","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Six Months Prolonged Abstinence","timeFrame":"Seven months post enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":61,"sd":null},{"arm":"Voucher","deltaMin":76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Patches","deltaMin":151,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12362011","18048638","20374628"],"seeAlso":["http://www.californiasmokershelpline.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":529},"commonTop":[]}}
