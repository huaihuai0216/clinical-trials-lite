In patients with allergies, there is an exaggerated production of IgE in response to specific substances such as pollens. Omalizumab is a new drug that inactivates IgE. This study tested the safety and efficacy of omalizumab against asthma attacks in children with allergic asthma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Clinically Significant Asthma Exacerbations Per Patient in the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Baseline to end of the fixed-dose steroid treatment period (Week 24)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Omalizumab","deltaMin":0.45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.64,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":56,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39309477","37088376","33223095","32298853","19910033"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":421},"commonTop":["Asthma","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Sinusitis","Headache"]}}
