Approximately 50% of those who develop Critical COVID-19 die, despite intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Patients with Critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure, currently treated with high flow nasal oxygen, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation will be treated with ZYESAMI (aviptadil), a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) plus maximal intensive care vs. placebo + maximal intensive care. Patients will be randomized to intravenous Aviptadil will receive escalating doses from 50 -150 pmol/kg/hr over 12 hours.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Resolution of Respiratory Failure (Alive and Free of Respiratory Failure)","timeFrame":"Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aviptadil IV in Escalating Doses + Standard of Care","deltaMin":72,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Standard of Care","deltaMin":33,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36044317"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":58,"n":131},"commonTop":["hypotension","diarrhoea","acute kidney injury","COVID-19","deep vein thrombosis"]}}
