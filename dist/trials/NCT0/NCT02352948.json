Patients with known EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase (TK) activating mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements are not eligible for the study (prospective testing is not planned within this study). The Standard of Care options are: an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib \\[TARCEVA®\\]), gemcitabine or vinorelbine (NAVELBINE®)","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"From randomization (Day 1) until death due to any cause, approximately 36 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sub-study A: Durvalumab","deltaMin":11.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sub-study A: SoC","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sub-study B: Durvalumab+Tremelimumab","deltaMin":11.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sub-study B: SoC","deltaMin":8.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.109"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":201,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34056687","32201234"],"seeAlso":["http://www.emergingmed.com/networks/AstraZeneca","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=2584&filename=D4191C00004-sap-arctic-ed-3_Redacted.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=2584&filename=D4191C00004-revised-csp-7_Redacted.pdf","https://filehosting-v2.pharmacm.com/api/Attachment/Download?tenantId=80217111&amp;parentIdentifier=D4191C00004&amp;attachmentIdentifier=6739cb21-2029-418c-8f56-df0682607b8b&amp;fileName=d4191c00004-study-synopsis_Redacted.pdf&amp;versionIdentifier="]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":62},"commonTop":["Decreased appetite","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Asthenia"]}}
