Participants will be enrolled into two cohorts. Cohort 1 will examine the effect of administering ocrelizumab per a shorter infusion protocol for Dose 2 or Dose 3. This cohort will consist of patients who have already received one or two doses of ocrelizumab according to the approved infusion protocol (i.e., per the currently U.S. label) and have reported no serious IRRs and who will then receive the next infusion of ocrelizumab at a higher rate in order to deliver 600 mg over the course of approximately 2 hours. Cohort 2 will examine the effect of administering ocrelizumab per a shorter infusion protocol for the second infusion of Dose 1. This cohort will consist of ocrelizumab na√Øve patients who, after receiving Infusion 1/Dose 1 of ocrelizumab at the approved rate (300 mg over approximately 2.5 hours or longer) have no reported serious IRRs, will then receive the second 300-mg shorter infusion over approximately 1.5 hours.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Infusion-related Reaction (IRR) Treated With 600 mg IV Ocrelizumab","timeFrame":"During or within 24 hours of administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort 1","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33045496"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":95},"commonTop":["Infusion related reaction","Fatigue"]}}
