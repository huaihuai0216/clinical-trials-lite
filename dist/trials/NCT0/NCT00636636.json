However, these treatments usually need to be taken 3 times a day for effective pain control. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new gabapentin tablet, which only needs to be taken once a day, is safe and effective for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) Average Daily Pain Score","timeFrame":"10 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"G-ER","deltaMin":-2.12,"sd":0.17},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.63,"sd":0.16}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0125"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27037091"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":221},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Headache","Somnolence","Nausea","Diarrhea"]}}
