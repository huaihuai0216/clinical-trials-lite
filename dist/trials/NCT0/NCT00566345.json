All subjects will be randomized to receive a single 0.5 ml intramuscular injection from one of three lots of seasonal Vero-cell derived influenza vaccine or saline placebo. Subjects will be monitored for 180 days following vaccination for occurrence of adverse events. For determining antibody response, subjects will have one blood draw before and one blood draw 21 days after vaccination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Developing Influenza Infection, as Confirmed by Viral Culture and Typing of Naso-pharyngeal Specimens","timeFrame":"21 days to 180 days after the date of vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Influenza Vaccine","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":62,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22267715","22172502","21329971"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":1829},"commonTop":["tenderness","injection site pain","muscle pain","headache","fatigue"]}}
