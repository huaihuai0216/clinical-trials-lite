Subjects will be in the dosing period of the study for 12 weeks in order to evaluate the incidence of hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in blood). Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled and all 12 will receive paricalcitol capsules.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Hypercalcemia","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Paricalcitol","deltaMin":15.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28332096"],"seeAlso":["http://www.rxabbvie.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":13},"commonTop":["NAUSEA","PYREXIA","COUGH","ABDOMINAL PAIN","ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER"]}}
