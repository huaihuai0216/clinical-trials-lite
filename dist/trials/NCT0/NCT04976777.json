AbbVie is updating the DEX PS DDS Applicator. This purpose of this study is to show that the updated DEX PS DDS Applicator works in adult participants with macular edema due to retinal diseases.\n\nThe DEX PS DDS is approved for the treatment of macular edema. Participants will be placed into 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives the same treatment drug delivered using different applicators. Around 54 adult participants with macular edema will be enrolled in the study in approximately 7-10 sites in the United States.\n\nParticipants will receive a single intravitreal (into the eye) administration of DEX PS DDS implant using either the currently-approved DEX PS DDS Applicator or the the updated Applicator. The participants will be observed for a duration of 7 days, with the DEX PS DDS implant received on day 1 and follow-up through day 7.\n\nThe updates being evaluated in this study are related to the DEX PS DDS Applicator only, with the safety and efficacy of the DEX PS DDS implant well characterized and the same as the currently marketed product. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The applicator function will be checked by medical assessment, checking for side effects, procedural complications and/or product complaints, and evaluating the administration procedure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Experiencing at Least One Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 7 Days After Study Drug Administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Updated DEX PS DDS 0.7 mg","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Approved DEX PS DDS 0.7 mg","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://rxabbvie.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":36},"commonTop":["CONJUNCTIVAL HAEMORRHAGE","INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE INCREASED","COVID-19"]}}
