The polyvalent (23-valent) pneumococcal vaccine, PPSV23, is the active comparator. In addition to studying safety/tolerability, it is hypothesized that, at 30 days postvaccination, the immunogenicity of V116 is noninferior to PPSV23 for the 12 common serotypes in V116 and PPSV23, and that V116 is superior to PPSV23 for the 9 serotypes unique to V116. It is also hypothesized that V116 is superior to PPSV23 in the percentage of participants with ≥4-fold rise from baseline in unique V116 serotypes, as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Solicited Injection-Site Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 5 days postvaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V116","deltaMin":4.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"PPSV23","deltaMin":6.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Colombia","Germany","Israel","New Zealand","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40333240"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26201&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":739},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Fatigue","Headache","Injection site erythema","Myalgia"]}}
