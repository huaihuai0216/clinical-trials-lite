Ultravist, the study drug, is used to improve the pictures obtained using computed tomography (CT). Ultravist acts like a dye to make CT pictures brighter and easier to read. In the case of this study, it will be injected into a vein in the patient's arm; from there, it travels through the blood stream and to the areas to be examined. CT scans will then be taken of the patient's head and/or body as ordered by his/her physician.\n\nPhase IIIb Study to Document the Safety and Efficacy of Ultravist 370 mg I/ml, When Administered Intravenously, in Volumes up to 162.2 ml, for Clinically Indicated Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) of the Head and/or Body","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Quality of Visualization of the Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) Images, Based on the Blinded Readers' Assessment.","timeFrame":"post administration assessment of study images","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Iopromide 370 mg I/mL","deltaMin":366,"sd":null},{"arm":"Iopromide 300 mg I/mL","deltaMin":17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States","Colombia","India","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":412},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dysgeusia","Erythema","Feeling Hot","Urticaria"]}}
