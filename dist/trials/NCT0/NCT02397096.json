The primary hypothesis is that a switch to doravirine, tenofovir, lamivudine will be non-inferior to continuation of the regimen at Screening for 24 weeks, as assessed by the proportion of participants maintaining HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\<50 copies/mL. The Base Study results will be based on the first 48 weeks of this ongoing study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Ribonucleic Acid (HIV-1 RNA) <50 Copies/mL","timeFrame":"Immediate Switch to MK-1439A arm: Week 48; Delayed Switch to MK-1439A arm: Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Switch Group (ISG)","deltaMin":90.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Delayed Switch Group (DSG)","deltaMin":94.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["40672760","33633036","32868326","30985556"],"seeAlso":["http://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26154&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":447},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Diarrhoea","Back pain","Arthralgia"]}}
