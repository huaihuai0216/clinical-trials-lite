The main objective of this study is to assess the cardiovascular safety of ertugliflozin. This trial includes 3 pre-defined glycemic sub-studies; 1. In participants receiving background insulin with or without metformin, 2. In participants receiving background sulfonylurea monotherapy, and 3. In participants receiving background metformin with sulfonylurea (all fully-enrolled).\n\nParticipants enrolled prior to Amendment 1 were in the overall study as well as a sub-study, if they met certain entry criteria. Participants enrolled following the start of Amendment 1 were only enrolled in the overall study. The sub-studies were the initial 18 weeks of the overall study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First Occurrence of MACE (Composite Endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events [Cardiovascular Death, Non-fatal Myocardial Infarction or Non-fatal Stroke]) (On-Treatment + 365-day Approach) (Overall Cardiovascular Study)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 6 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 5 mg (Overall Cardiovascular Study)","deltaMin":3.64,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 15 mg (Overall Cardiovascular Study)","deltaMin":4.16,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (Overall Cardiovascular Study)","deltaMin":4.01,"sd":null},{"arm":"All Ertugliflozin (Overall Cardiovascular Study)","deltaMin":3.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.002"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["30290289","38770818","37003273","35691283","35603908","35596030","35266296","35233908","34620621","34497110","33769675","33721213","33694093","33665685","33026243","32966714","29693360"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":958,"n":2746},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Urinary tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Hypertension"]}}
