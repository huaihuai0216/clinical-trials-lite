Participants, all personnel involved in the evaluation of participants' response to treatment (e.g., Investigators, study coordinators, study pharmacists), and designated Sponsor team members will be blinded to study treatment. Participants are required to have a histologically-confirmed diagnosis of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) gene-mutated cholangiocarcinoma that is not eligible for curative resection, transplantation, or ablative therapies prior to enrollment. IDH1 mutation testing will be performed at participating investigative sites. Participants must have progression of disease and have received at least 1 but not more than 2 prior treatment regimens for advanced disease (nonresectable or metastatic). All participants must have received either a gemcitabine or a 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemotherapy regimen.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Independent Radiology Committee (IRC)","timeFrame":"From the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause (Up to approximately 2 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AG-120","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":49,"countries":["United States","France","Italy","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32416072","38278871","34554208"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":43,"n":123},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Fatigue","Decreased appetite","Abdominal pain"]}}
