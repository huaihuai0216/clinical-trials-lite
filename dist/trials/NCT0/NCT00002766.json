Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, or chronic myelogenous leukemia.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different chemotherapy regimens and comparing them to see how well they work in treating adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, or chronic myelogenous leukemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Complete Remission (CR)","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All-2","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"L-20","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":39,"n":81},"commonTop":["Hypokalemia","Fatigue","Hypophosphatemia","Pain, other","Abdominal pain/cramping"]}}
