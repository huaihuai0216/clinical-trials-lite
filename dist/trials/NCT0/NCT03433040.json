Since obesity is associated with lower levels of plasma 17OHP-C, the investigator hypothesize that higher doses of 17OHP-C may help to prevent spontaneous PTB among obese women. The study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics of 17 OHP-C in obese compared with non-obese women.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Mean Trough Levels of 17-OHPC in the Three Groups at 20-22 Weeks, 27-29 Weeks and 34-36 Weeks.","timeFrame":"From enrollment to 36 weeks of pregnancy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Non Obese","deltaMin":10.1,"sd":4.5},{"arm":"Obese - Control","deltaMin":13,"sd":5.1},{"arm":"Obese","deltaMin":18,"sd":6.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":[]}}
