Patients will be enrolled at approximately 65 sites in the U.S. and ex-US for up to 23 weeks. Patients will be randomly assigned to either a low, medium or high dose, or placebo. The study will include a baseline period, a titration period and a maintenance period. After the maintenance period, patients will either continue into an open-label extension study or enter the taper period with a final visit 1 week after the last dose.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Reduction in Number of Drop Seizures (12-week Maintenance Period).","timeFrame":"4-week baseline period and 12-week maintenance period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Clobazam Low Dose","deltaMin":41.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Clobazam Medium Dose","deltaMin":49.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Clobazam High Dose","deltaMin":68.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":12.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.0120"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0015"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":53,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belarus","India","Lithuania"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21956725","33825230","27683846"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":58},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Upper respiratory tract infection","Pyrexia","Nasopharyngitis","Lethargy"]}}
