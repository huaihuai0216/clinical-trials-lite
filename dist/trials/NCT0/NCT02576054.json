This study will consist of two periods. Period I of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of V501 up to Month 7. Period II of the study is to evaluate the long-term immunogenicity and safety from Month 7 to Month 30. Two analyses are planned. The first analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed their Month 7 visit or have been discontinued before that time. The second analysis will be conducted at the end of study. The primary hypothesis tested in this study is that seroconversion rates for the vaccine HPV types will be \\>90% at 4 weeks postdose 3.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Seroconversion for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18","timeFrame":"Four weeks postdose 3 (Month 7)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V501","deltaMin":94.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31155600"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":100},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema","Nasopharyngitis","Injection site pruritus"]}}
