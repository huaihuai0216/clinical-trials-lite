However, it is not known if giving supplemental vitamin D to those with MS reduces the risk of attacks, and some research suggests that vitamin D could even be harmful to people with MS.\n\nIn this clinical trial, patients with relapsing-remitting MS will receive high-dose or low-dose oral vitamin D in addition to an approved therapy for MS, glatiramer acetate. Patients will be evaluated for two years, and the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on the rate of MS attacks and on the number of new lesions and change in brain volume on MRI will be determined. Establishing this association will have major implications for the treatment of individuals with MS throughout the world.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Subjects That Experience a Relapse","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Low-dose Vitamin D3","deltaMin":0.32,"sd":null},{"arm":"High-dose Vitamin D3","deltaMin":0.34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.60"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.57"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37125397","25311447"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":82},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory infection","Numbness or tingling","Headache / worsened headache / migraine","Fatigue / increased fatigue","Joint pain or swelling"]}}
