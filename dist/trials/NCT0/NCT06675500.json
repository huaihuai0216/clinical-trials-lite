Most studies suggest that the frequency ranges between 25-40%.\n\nSome studies have shown that serum hypomagnesaemia is common after coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and other types of cardiac surgery and is associated with postoperative morbidity such as atrial tachyarrhythmia.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate the anti-arrhythmic effect of Magnesium Sulfate in prevention of atrial fibrillation post cardiac surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With New Episodes of Atrial Fibrillation","timeFrame":"7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A (Study Group)","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group B (Control Group)","deltaMin":27,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Egypt"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15831645","10654548","2566713"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":65},"commonTop":["Hypotension"]}}
