The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that FS Grifols is not inferior to commercially-available oxidized cellulose pads (Surgicel速) in providing benefit in the time to hemostasis (i.e, the stoppage of bleeding). This study has a Preliminary Part (I) for study teams to become familiar with the application of FS Grifols and a Primary Part (II) to assess the safety and efficacy of FS Grifols. In both parts of the study, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either FS Grifols or Surgicel.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects Achieving Hemostasis Within 4 Minutes After Treatment Start","timeFrame":"From start of treatment until 4 minutes after treatment start","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fibrin Sealant (FS) Grifols","deltaMin":82.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Surgicel速","deltaMin":77.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States","Hungary","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":169},"commonTop":["Procedural pain","Procedural nausea","Nausea","Constipation","Pyrexia"]}}
