Another aim is to check if they tolerate the repeated SC injections.\n\nParticipants will receive a SC injection of lanadelumab every two weeks for 26 weeks. The first two doses of lanadelumab will be given at the study clinic. Once a participant (and/or parent/caregiver) has been appropriately trained, lanadelumab can be self-injected. Visits to the study clinic are planned for the first, third and fourth week and then every 4 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Investigator-Confirmed Angioedema Attacks During the Treatment Period of Day 0 Through Day 182","timeFrame":"Day 0 through Day 182","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.63,"sd":1.357},{"arm":"Lanadelumab 300 mg","deltaMin":2.17,"sd":2.062}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.899"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":45,"countries":["United States","Canada","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Poland","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40469312"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b5fdc4db2bf003ab47309"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":27},"commonTop":["Angioedema","Injection site pain","Headache","Arthralgia","Nausea"]}}
