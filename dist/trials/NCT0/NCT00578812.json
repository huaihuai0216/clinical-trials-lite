Patients with adjacent or non-adjacent prior fusion were allowed. A total of 416 patients with a degenerated cervical disc at one level from C3-C4 to C7-T1 were enrolled in the clinical trial and 403 were treated. Patients were randomly assigned to be treated either with the PCM Cervical Disc or ACDF.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Individual Patient Overall Success","timeFrame":"24 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PCM Cervical Disc-Investigational","deltaMin":142,"sd":null},{"arm":"Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion - Control Group","deltaMin":98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.nuvasive.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":68,"n":214},"commonTop":["Systemic - Musculoskeletal / Neck/Arm Pain","Systemic - Musculoskeletal Trauma","Systemic - Musculoskeletal / Back/Leg Pain","Systemic - Other","Systemic - Musculoskeletal / Spinal Event"]}}
