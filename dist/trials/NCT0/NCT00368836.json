The D-dimer blood test is currently used to diagnose PEs, but it is not always accurate for individuals who have recently undergone surgery or who have inflammatory-provoking diseases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Carboximeter, a new PE diagnostic device that measures carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) output, in individuals at risk for developing PEs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Phase I: Percentage Change in the Postoperative End Tidal CO2/O2 Ratio and D-dimer Concentration Relative to the Preoperative Measurement","timeFrame":"Pre-op measurement: the morning of surgery.
