During the chronic phase of SCI, a characteristic dyslipidemia emerges, which is characterized by low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, with values often qualifying to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, and elevations in serum triglycerides (TG). Serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations in those with SCI are usually similar to those of the general population. The current proposal in persons with SCI aims to determine the safety and efficacy of short-term fenofibrate treatment, an anti-lipid medication whose primary action lowers serum TG and raises serum HDL-C levels.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Triglyceride Concentration (Percent Change From Baseline)","timeFrame":"two months from initiating drug treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fenofibrate","deltaMin":-40,"sd":12},{"arm":"No Intervention","deltaMin":-2,"sd":16}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Elevated liver enzymes","Gastrointestinal discomfort"]}}
