Participants who qualify for the study will be randomly assigned to receive a fixed dose of asenapine (either 2.5 mg or 5 mg twice daily \\[BID\\]) or placebo for 8 weeks. Throughout the study, observations will be made on each participant at various times to assess the efficacy and safety of the study treatment. The primary objective of the trial is to demonstrate significant superiority of at least one asenapine dose to placebo, as measured by the change from baseline of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Day 56.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Day 56","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 56","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-17.8,"sd":17.8},{"arm":"Asenapine 2.5 mg BID","deltaMin":-23.7,"sd":18.6},{"arm":"Asenapine 5.0 mg BID","deltaMin":-25.5,"sd":16.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.070"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.064"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.064"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.046"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.273"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26091193"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":102},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Headache","Insomnia","Sedation","Akathisia"]}}
