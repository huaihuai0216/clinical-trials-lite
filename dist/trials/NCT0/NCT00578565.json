Safety of rituximab therapy in this disease will be assessed through patient history, physical exams and laboratory parameters.\n\n* Twelve male/or female patient with RA-associated lung disease (6 of each nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) histological subtype) will be enrolled\n* The study involves 12 visits over 48 weeks\n* Rituximab will be administered intravenously at Day 1 and Day 15 with repeat dosing at six months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLco) From Baseline to 48 Weeks","timeFrame":"baseline, 48 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":10},"commonTop":["Infusion reaction"]}}
