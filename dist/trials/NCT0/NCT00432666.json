Injected into the muscle, incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) causes local weakening. Botulinum toxin type A is widely used for treatment of various neurological conditions. This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity of the upper limb.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Reduction of at Least 1 Point at Week 4 Compared to Baseline in Ashworth Score in Wrist Flexors","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin)","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Czechia","Hungary","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":73},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Contusion","Headache","Hypercholesterolaemia","Hyperglycaemia"]}}
