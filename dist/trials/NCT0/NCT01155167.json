The investigators hypothesize that topical nitroglycerin and lidocaine will reduce radial artery spasm. Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization via the radial artery will be randomized to topical nitroglycerin + lidocaine versus placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Radial Artery Diameter","timeFrame":"Baseline and after 30 minutes of drug application","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-5.6,"sd":2.1},{"arm":"Topical Dilator","deltaMin":16.5,"sd":4.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23582415"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":43},"commonTop":[]}}
