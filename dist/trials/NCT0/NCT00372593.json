Monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with gemtuzumab may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without gemtuzumab in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy and gemtuzumab to see how well they work compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating young patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival at 3 Years","timeFrame":"Time from study entry to time of induction failure, relapse, or death, assessed at 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Standard Arm - No GMTZ, AML Pts w/Out Down Syndrome","deltaMin":46.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Experimental - With GMTZ, AML Pts w/Out Down Syndrome","deltaMin":53.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm A: Standard Arm - No GMTZ, AML Patients With Down Syndrome","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":198,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22378848","25092781","40294366","38295280","37267439","36815378","34596937","33080007","28883080","27133823","23471307"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":511},"commonTop":["Infections and infestations - Other","Febrile neutropenia","Hypokalemia","Anorexia","Hyperglycemia"]}}
