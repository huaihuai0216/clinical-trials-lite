Recent studies suggest that people respond differently to some asthma medications (eg Serevent, Foradil). Some people feel better when they use these inhalers, but others may not, and some people get worse. It seems that this difference shows up more often in Blacks than in Whites, which is why we are looking for Black subjects for this study. In all people, this difference seems to depend on their genes or DNA. This study is comparing the use of long acting asthma medications (Serevent, Foradil) to Tiotropium (Spiriva) for the treatment of asthma. Spiriva is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will help to see if this medication is also useful for treating asthma and whether it works better for some people than the current asthma medications.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Asthma Exacerbation (Mean Number of Exacerbations/Person-year)","timeFrame":"evaluated monthly (on average) via questionnaire for 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tiotropium","deltaMin":0.37,"sd":null},{"arm":"Salmeterol or Formoterol","deltaMin":0.42,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.31"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26505596","36472162"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":84,"n":532},"commonTop":["Disease Progression","Asthma"]}}
