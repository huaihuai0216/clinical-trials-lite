The study will also assess the impact of BMN 270 (compared to FVIII prophylaxis) on: the number of bleeding episodes requiring exogenous FVIII treatment in \"Post FVIII Prophylaxis to Last Visit\", FVIII activity as measured by chromogenic sustrate assay at Week 104 following intravenous infusion of BMN 270, usage of exogenous FVIII replacement therapy in \"Post FVIII Prophylaxis to Last Visit\", health-related quality of life patient-reported outcomes at week 104 following intravenous infusion of BMN 270.
