Approximately 292 subjects will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms; belimumab plus rituximab-placebo (Arm A, control), belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B, combination), or belimumab plus standard therapy (Arm C, reference). Belimumab will be administered as subcutaneous (SC) and rituximab-placebo or rituximab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusions. The total duration of the study is for 104 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a State of Disease Control at Week 52","timeFrame":"Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Belimumab + Placebo","deltaMin":16.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Belimumab + Rituximab","deltaMin":19.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Belimumab + Standard Therapy","deltaMin":25.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.5342"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":32},"locations":{"siteCount":79,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Mexico","Netherlands","Russia","South Korea","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39159997","38775637","33687069","30898822","30055091"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":72},"commonTop":["Headache","Urinary tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Arthralgia"]}}
