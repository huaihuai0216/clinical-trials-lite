Caspofungin acetate, fluconazole, and voriconazole may be effective in preventing fungal infections in patients following donor stem cell transplant. It is not yet known whether caspofungin acetate is more effective than fluconazole or voriconazole in preventing fungal infections in patients following donor stem cell transplant.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"42-day-cumulative Incidence of Proven or Probable Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI)","timeFrame":"Up to 42 days following allogeneic HCT","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Caspofungin Acetate)","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Fluconazole or Voriconazole)","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":49,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33136159"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":144},"commonTop":["Respiratory failure","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Acute kidney injury","Sepsis"]}}
