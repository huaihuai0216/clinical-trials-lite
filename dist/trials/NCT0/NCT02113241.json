About a quarter of the adult population suffers the disease.\n\nDapagliflozin is an inhibitor of the sodium-glucose co-transporter SGLT2 in the kidney and is a novel treatment for diabetes type 2. Some studies indicate that SGLT2 inhibitors have benefits on blood pressure, triglycerides levels and help to raise the levels of high density lipoproteins cholesterol (c-HDL).\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.\n\nThe investigators hypothesis is that the administration of dapagliflozin modifies the metabolic syndrome, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Waist Circumference at Week 12.","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dapagliflozin","deltaMin":97.6,"sd":8.9},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":97.2,"sd":6.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.089"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22238392","22446170","22701099","24105299","23910664","19996149","23210765","24130972","23194084","20518806","23668478","20566676","23906445","24463448"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Urinary infection"]}}
