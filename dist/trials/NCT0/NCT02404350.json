Long term efficacy up to 2 years was based on signs and symptoms of joint/bone structure preservation (X-ray) and improvement in physical function measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI©), as well as skin and nail improvement for psoriasis signs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) Achieving an American College of Rheumatology Response 20 (ACR20) at Week 16","timeFrame":"Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Secukinumab 150 mg Without Load","deltaMin":59.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Secukinumab 150 mg With Load","deltaMin":55.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Secukinumab 300 mg With Load","deltaMin":62.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":27.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":172,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Canada","Chile","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","Germany","Greece","Guatemala","Hungary","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Mexico","Netherlands","Philippines","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Thailand","United Kingdom","Vietnam"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29550766","38446397","34795065","34330846","31586420"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":222},"commonTop":["Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Headache","Dyslipidaemia"]}}
