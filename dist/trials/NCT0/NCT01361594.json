Blood sugar control with intravenous insulin may prevent such hospital complications. Many patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery (CABG) develop high blood sugars and require insulin therapy (shortly before or after surgery). It is not clear what the best insulin regimen is or what is the best blood sugar target in these patients. Accordingly, this research study aims to determine optimal blood glucose levels during the in patients undergoing cardiac bypass surgery. Patients will be divided in two groups. The intensive insulin group will be maintained at blood glucose between 100-140 mg/dl and the conventional treatment group at a glucose level between 140-180 mg/dl. The insulins to be used in this trial (lantus, aspart and regular insulin) are approved for use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). A total of 326 patients with high blood glucose after cardiac bypass surgery will be recruited in this study. Patients will be recruited at Emory University Hospital, Emory Midtown Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects That Were Diagnosed for Peri-operative Complications","timeFrame":"Within 6 months of hospitalization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensive Insulin Treatment","deltaMin":58,"sd":null},{"arm":"Conventional Insulin Treatment","deltaMin":70,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":63,"n":151},"commonTop":["Hypoglycemia (immediately after treatment)","Surgical re-intervention","ICU Re-admission","Hypoglycemia (ICU)"]}}
