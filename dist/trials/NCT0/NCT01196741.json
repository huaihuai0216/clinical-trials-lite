The trial will also determine toxicity and ascertain whether the combination of paclitaxel plus saracatinib should proceed to a phase III trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"6 Month Progression-free Survival Rate (PFS) (Based on Combined Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 +/- Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA125 Criteria)","timeFrame":"Using RECIST v1.1 at baseline; at Week 7 or 8 of each chemotherapy cycle; and 3 monthly during follow up.
