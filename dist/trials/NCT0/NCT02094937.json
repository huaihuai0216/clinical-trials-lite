The study is divided into Run-in period, Period 1 (open-label treatment), Period 2 (double blind treatment) and Follow-up. Subjects with well controlled asthma after completing a run-in period of 4 weeks will be switched from middle-dose ICS/long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) equivalent dose to once-daily FF/VI 100/25 mcg for an 8 weeks treatment period (Period 1). After this, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either FP 250 mcg twice daily, FP 100 mcg twice daily or FF 100 mcg once daily in a 12 week double blind treatment period (Period 2). There will be a 1 week Follow-up Period following completion of the double-blind treatment period, or early withdrawal from the study. Overall , the total duration of subject's participation in the study will be for 25 weeks.
