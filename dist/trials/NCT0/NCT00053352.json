Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug, and giving them after surgery, may kill any remaining tumor cells following surgery. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is effective in decreasing the recurrence of childhood germ cell tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-Free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"3 Years after enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1","deltaMin":87,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":126,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31355926"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":104},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Anemia","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Febrile neutropenia"]}}
