The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the contribution on lung function (as measured by trough forced expiratory volume in one second \\[FEV1\\]) of FF 100 mcg to the FF/VI 100/25 mcg QD combination by comparison of the latter with VI 25 mcg QD and the safety of FF/VI 100/25 mcg over a 12-week treatment period in subjects with COPD.
