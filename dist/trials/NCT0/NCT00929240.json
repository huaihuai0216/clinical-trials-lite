Eligible patients will receive up to 6 x 3 week cycles of treatment with Avastin (15 mg/mg IV on Day 1 of each cycle) + docetaxel (75-100 mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle). Those patients who do not progress will be randomized to 3 week cycles of either a) Avastin (15 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each cycle) + Xeloda (1000 mg/m2 po bid on Days 1-14 of each cycle) or b) Avastin alone. Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient request for withdrawal or end of study, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death (Maintenance Phase Data Cutoff October 4, 2013)","timeFrame":"Randomization, at the end of every third cycle (every 9 weeks) until the end of maintenance phase and every 3 months until disease progression or death until data cutoff on October 4, 2013, up to 4 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Maintenance Phase: Bevacizumab","deltaMin":88.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Maintenance Phase: Bevacizumab + Capecitabine","deltaMin":75.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":63,"countries":["Brazil","China","Egypt","France","Hong Kong","India","Italy","Poland","Saudi Arabia","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25273343"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":78,"n":284},"commonTop":["Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome","Neutropenia","Hypertension"]}}
