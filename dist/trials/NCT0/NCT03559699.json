The study was composed of two parts. During Part 1, Dose Optimization Period, participants started on a dose of 5 mg AG-348 administered twice daily. Over the course of Part 1 each participant's dose of AG-348 was sequentially increased to 20 mg twice a day, followed by 50 mg twice a day depending on their tolerance. During Part 2, Fixed-Dose Period, participants received AG-348 at their optimized dose from Part 1.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving a Reduction in Transfusion Burden in Part 2","timeFrame":"From Part 2, Day 1 to Part 2 Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AG-348","deltaMin":37,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","France","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36594181","35988546","31974203"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":27},"commonTop":["Headache","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Nausea","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Fatigue"]}}
