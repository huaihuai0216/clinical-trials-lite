In people with spinal cord injury, some fibers may be destroyed at the site of injury, while others remain connected but do not work correctly to carry electrical impulses. As a result, subjects with an incomplete spinal cord injury may have spasticity which is muscle spasms or muscle stiffness that makes movement difficult. Fampridine-SR is an experimental drug that increases the ability of the nerve to conduct electrical impulses. This study will examine the effects of Fampridine-SR on moderate to severe lower-limb spasticity, as well as the effects on bodily functions such as bladder control, bowel function and sexual function. The study will also examine the possible risks of taking Fampridine-SR.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Double-blind Change From Baseline in Ashworth Score Evaluating Spasticity","timeFrame":"Baseline (visits 2,3) average score days 7,14 and double-blind treatment period (visits 4-7) average score days 28-98","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fampridine-SR 50mg/Day","deltaMin":-0.28,"sd":0.046},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.16,"sd":0.047}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.acorda.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":103},"commonTop":["Hypertonia","Urinary Tract Infection","Pain","Constipation","Paresthesia"]}}
