Patients will be randomized either to continue or discontinue Herceptin treatment (2mg/kg iv infusion weekly, or 6mg/kg iv infusion every 3 weeks) while receiving 2nd line chemotherapy of the investigator's choice. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event","timeFrame":"Baseline (BL) and every 8 weeks thereafter","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Chemotherapy Alone","deltaMin":58.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy + Trastuzumab","deltaMin":58.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":26},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Leukopenia","Other - unspecified","Nausea","Fever"]}}
