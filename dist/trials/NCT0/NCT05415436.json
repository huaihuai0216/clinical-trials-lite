We hypothesize that slow administration of IV propofol will have less hemodynamic disturbances and will require less amount of vasoactive medication for BP correction when compared to standard FDA approved administration rate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patients Administered Propofol at a Slower Rate of Infusion Will Have Lower Incidence of Post Induction Hypotension Than Patients Administered Propofol at FDA Approved Rate.","timeFrame":"induction to 1 hour post induction","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A- Propofol Given at FDA Approved Administration Speed","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group B- Propofol Given Over 120 Seconds","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":53},"commonTop":[]}}
