While on this study, participants will continue to take their usual, prescribed, stable regimen of levodopa (L-dopa) or L-dopa plus adjunct PD medications and will be randomized to receive 2 mg preladenant, 5 mg preladenant, or placebo, twice daily, for 12 weeks. After that, participants may choose to receive additional treatment with preladenant. The primary hypothesis is that at least the 5 mg twice daily dose of preladenant is superior to placebo as measured by the change from Baseline to Week 12 in the mean \"off\" time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Average \"Off\" Time (Hours Per Day) at Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Preladenant 2 mg","deltaMin":-1,"sd":0.2},{"arm":"Preladenant 5 mg","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":0.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.8,"sd":0.19}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.4933"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.2364"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26523919"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":157},"commonTop":["Constipation","Headache","Fall","Dizziness","Dyskinesia"]}}
