A few isolated case reports of treatment of individuals with a cutaneous porphyria suggest that cholestyramine and colestipol effectively remove porphyrins. Hypothesis: orally administered colestipol will effectively reduce sun sensitivity and lower erythrocyte porphyrin concentrations in subjects with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Photosensitivity, Assessed by Measuring the Number of Minutes of Sun Tolerance","timeFrame":"At 60 days of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Colestipol Treatment","deltaMin":65.8,"sd":58.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"22 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":4},"commonTop":[]}}
