The primary hypothesis is that the intensive strategy will reduce 60-day all cause mortality by 10% compared to the conventional strategy - i.e.,a reduction from 55% in the conventional arm to 45% in the intensive arm. Secondary outcomes are 60-day in-hospital all-cause mortality, 1-year all cause mortality, and recovery of renal function by day 28. The study will recruit 1164 patients over a period of 3 years, 8 months and each patient will be actively followed for 60 days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"60-day All-cause Mortality","timeFrame":"60 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensive Renal Replacement Therapy","deltaMin":302,"sd":null},{"arm":"Less-intensive Renal Replacement Therapy","deltaMin":289,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.47"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18492867","19678919","16317811","20507953","22595826","38461657","37357351","36416787","36068554","34519356","32470389","28443283"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":287,"n":563},"commonTop":[]}}
