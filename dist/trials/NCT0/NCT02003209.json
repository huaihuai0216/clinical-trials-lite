Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using goserelin acetate and aromatase inhibition therapy may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy with or without hormone therapy may be an effective treatment for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, operable or locally advanced breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent of Patients With Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in the Breast and Post Therapy Lymph Nodes","timeFrame":"Up to 2.8 years (when all patients completed primary breast surgery)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Combination Chemotherapy, Surgery, Radiation)","deltaMin":41.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Chemo, Estrogen Deprivation, Surgery, Radiation)","deltaMin":45.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":22,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":732,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":158},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Anemia","Fatigue","Alopecia","Nausea"]}}
