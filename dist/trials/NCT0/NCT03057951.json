People with chronic heart failure may need to be hospitalised for their condition. Some people with chronic heart failure may eventually die from their condition. The purpose of the study is to find out whether a medicine called empagliflozin lowers the chances of patients having to go to hospital for heart failure and whether it improves their survival. The study is open to patients with a type of chronic heart failure called chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n\nParticipants stay in the study until researchers have enough information about how effective empagliflozin is. It is expected that participants who enter at the very beginning of the enrolment period may be in the study for over 3 years, while participants who enter near the end of the enrolment period may be in the study for less than 2 years. The participants are put into 2 groups. It is decided by chance who gets into which group. One group gets empagliflozin tablets every day and the other group gets placebo tablets every day. Placebo tablets look like empagliflozin tablets but contain no medicine.\n\nParticipants visit the doctors regularly. During these visits, the doctors collect information about the participant's health. The doctors want to know how many patients had to go to hospital because of heart failure or who died from cardiovascular disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First Event of Adjudicated Cardiovascular (CV) Death or Adjudicated Hospitalisation for Heart Failure (HHF)","timeFrame":"From randomization until completion of the planned treatment phase, up to 1403 days.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":8.67,"sd":null},{"arm":"10 mg Empagliflozin","deltaMin":6.86,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":619,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Colombia","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","India","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39895437","38770818","38439582","37942723","37621153","37223933","36478225","36129693","36098051","36017745","35762322","35687107","35670067","35603667","35331406","34779658","34693515","34449189","31081589"],"seeAlso":["https://www.mystudywindow.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1543,"n":2989},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Hypotension","Fall","Urinary tract infection","Hyperkalaemia"]}}
