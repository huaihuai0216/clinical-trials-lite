Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and vincristine, work in different ways to stop tumor from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with standard local ophthalmic therapy is effective in treating intraocular retinoblastoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival","timeFrame":"At 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vincristine Sulfate and Carboplatin and Surgery","deltaMin":0.65,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":19,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":21},"commonTop":["Platelet count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased"]}}
