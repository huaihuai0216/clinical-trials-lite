The primary clinical hypothesis is that in men with low bone mineral density, the mean percent change in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months in subjects receiving denosumab will be greater than in subjects receiving placebo. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody with a high affinity for Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor (RANK) Ligand that can bind and neutralize the activity of human RANK Ligand similar to the action of endogenous osteoprotegerin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density Percent Change From Baseline at Month 12","timeFrame":"From Baseline to 12 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Denosumab 60 mg Q6M","deltaMin":5.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":39},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25607608","22723310"],"seeAlso":["http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":120},"commonTop":["Back pain","Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Constipation"]}}
