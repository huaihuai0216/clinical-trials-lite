Patients do not get needed care and agency financial stability is threatened. The Network for Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) began as a high-intensity improvement collaborative of 39 addiction treatment agencies distributed across 25 states. NIATx substantially improved time to treatment and continuation in treatment by making improvements to organizational processes (such as first contact, intake and assessment, engagement, level of care transitions, paperwork, social support, outreach, and scheduling) in preliminary studies. While the results are very encouraging, they have, by intent, been obtained from a select group of agencies using a high-cost combination of services. A more practical diffusion model is needed to spread process improvements across the spectrum of treatment agencies. This study is a cluster-randomized trial to test the effectiveness and cost of less expensive combinations of the services that make up the NIATx collaborative (interest circles, coach calls, coach visits and learning sessions).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Average Waiting Time From First Contact to Treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline and 15 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Interest Circle Call + Website","deltaMin":0.253,"sd":1.514},{"arm":"Coaching + Website","deltaMin":4.61,"sd":1.414},{"arm":"Full: LS, Coaching, ICC, Website","deltaMin":4.723,"sd":1.421},{"arm":"Learning Session + Website","deltaMin":3.52,"sd":1.407}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23316787","22716460","23021494","22193826","21524303","21918924","21371751","20942294","19356862","18259871","23378669","19195813","25243237","33413357","30032945","27681711"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":49},"commonTop":[]}}
