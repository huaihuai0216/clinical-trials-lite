The incidence and severity of CDI has increased in recent years and CDI recurrences (r-CDI) due to the appearance of new episodes in patients with a previous cured CDI, represent a serious and complex clinical issue. Although antibiotics are the recommended therapy for the first episode of CDI, treatment with oral vancomycin and/or metronidazole often results in significant treatment failure. In addition, the treatment of r-CDI is not adequately standardized, and although the most widely used treatment is the administration of fidaxomicin and bezlotoxumab, its efficacy in patients who already have r-CDI is not proven. In the late years, Fecal Microbiota Transfer (FMT) has emerged as the preferred non-pharmacological treatment to manage CDI with multiple recurrences and recent clinical trials have evaluated its potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with primary CD infection.\n\nThe objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the MBK-01 medication, consisting of heterologous lyophilized fecal microbiota capsules coming from healthy donors in comparison to the treatment with fidaxomicin, in 92 patients with primary or r-CDI.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Global Absence of Diarrhea Due to Clostridiodes Difficile 8 Weeks After the Start of the Treatment","timeFrame":"8 weeks after the start of the treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MBK-01","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fidaxomicin","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.228"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31883938","30221898"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-004591-17/ES"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":45},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","C-reactive protein increased","Abdominal pain","Headache","Flatulence"]}}
