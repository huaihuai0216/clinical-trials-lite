When taken regularly, the active ingredient of Cystagon® (cysteamine bitartrate) reduces cystine in the body. RP103 has the same active ingredient as Cystagon® and is designed to reduce cystine in a similar way that Cystagon® does. To decide if RP103 is better than Cystagon®, the study will look at two types of blood tests. One test is pharmacodynamics (PD), which measures the amount of white blood cell (WBC) cystine after taking study drug. WBC cystine is a laboratory test used to find out if cysteamine bitartrate is reducing cystine levels in the body. The second test is pharmacokinetics (PK), which measures the amount of cysteamine in the blood after taking the drug.\n\nRP103 is different from Cystagon®: Instead of the cysteamine bitartrate being absorbed from the stomach, RP103 is designed to be absorbed from the small intestine. This may make the effects of the drug last longer, so that it can be taken twice a day instead of four times a day like Cystagon®.\n\nSome cystinosis patients have bad breath (halitosis) when they take Cystagon®. Study participants who experience bad breath with Cystagon® will be asked if they would like to participate in an optional \"halitosis substudy\" to investigate this issue by collecting some extra PK blood samples.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Difference Between Morning and Non-Morning Log White Blood Cell (WBC) Cystine Values","timeFrame":"While taking Cystagon® (Months 1, 2, 3): within 15 minutes pre-morning (AM) and pre-non AM dose.
