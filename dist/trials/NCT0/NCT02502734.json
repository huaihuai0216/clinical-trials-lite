Approximately 65 paediatric asthmatic subjects, aged 5 to 11 years (inclusive), will be screened to achieve 60 randomised and 50 evaluable subjects. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will enter the 2 week run-in period. After completing run-in period, each subject will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment sequences: inhaled fluticasone furoate followed by placebo or placebo followed by inhaled fluticasone furoate. Each treatment will be administered via the ELLIPTA™ dry powder inhaler. The two treatment periods will be separated by a two-week wash-out period. Subjects completing two treatment period will enter into 7 days follow-up period. ARNUITY™ ELLIPTA (FF) is approved in the US for adults and adolescents aged 12 and above.\n\nARNUITY and ELLIPTA are a registered trademarks of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Growth Rate in Lower-leg Growth, as Determined by Knemometry.","timeFrame":"Over a two week (14 day) treatment period for FF 50mcg OD and Placebo respectively.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.3638,"sd":0.02793},{"arm":"Fluticasone Furoate","deltaMin":0.3118,"sd":0.02793}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Denmark"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28545804"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":60},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Oropharyngeal pain","Pyrexia"]}}
