Durable suppression of viral replication is achieved in the treatment of chronic viral diseases by preventing of the emergence of drug-resistant mutations. The clinical guidelines for the management of lamivudine resistant patients are variable. Some recommend switching to another agent without cross-resistance, while others recommend adding on another agent without cross-resistance. Limited clinical data exists to demonstrate whether tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF; TDF) is an effective monotherapy for lamivudine resistant patients or if it should be used as part of a combination therapy regimen.\n\nThis study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of tenofovir DF monotherapy versus emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir DF combination therapy in participants with chronic HBV with lamivudine resistance (presence of the rtM204I/V mutation with or without the rtL180M mutation) over a 240-week period. Participants in this study must be receiving lamivudine treatment at the time of enrollment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HBV DNA < 400 Copies/mL at Week 96","timeFrame":"Week 96","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tenofovir DF","deltaMin":89.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"FTC/Tenofovir DF","deltaMin":86.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.43"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":69,"countries":["United States","Austria","Bulgaria","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Greece","Hungary","New Zealand","Poland","Romania","Serbia","Spain","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24929235","24861361","24368224","27545497"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":141},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Fatigue","Arthralgia","Back pain"]}}
