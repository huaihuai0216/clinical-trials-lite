Researchers will test somapacitan to see how well it works, compared to the standard treatment with Norditropin®. The participants will either get Norditropin® once every day or somapacitan once every week - which treatment the participant gets is decided by chance. The participant and the study doctor will know which treatment the participant gets. The study includes a 52 week treatment period and a minimum of 30 days follow up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Height Velocity","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 0); Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Norditropin","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":2.3},{"arm":"Somapacitan","deltaMin":11,"sd":2.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":36},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Pyrexia","Cough","COVID-19","Respiratory tract infection"]}}
