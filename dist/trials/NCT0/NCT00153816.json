Building on their previous work, the investigators will investigate the chemopreventive effect of vitamin D in the large bowel, to study whether calcium with vitamin D is more effective than calcium alone, and to confirm their positive finding regarding calcium. The goal of this study is the development of chemopreventive combinations that will reduce risk of colorectal neoplasia sufficiently to permit the lengthening of surveillance intervals in most patients and to clarify important issues regarding the mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and chemoprevention.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Colorectal Adenomas","timeFrame":"1 to 10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Full Factorial Placebo","deltaMin":48.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Full Factorial Calcium","deltaMin":44.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Full Factorial Vitamin D","deltaMin":47,"sd":null},{"arm":"Full Factorial Calcium Plus Vitamin D","deltaMin":45.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Two Arm Placebo","deltaMin":32.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Two Arm Vitamin D","deltaMin":32.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":31},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36701139","34289971","33022713","29496722","28767463","27978548","27683872","27474021","26465985","25329821","25070320","24014734","18541589"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":84,"n":415},"commonTop":["Hypercreatinemia","Non-melanoma skin cancer","Fracture","Osteopenia"]}}
