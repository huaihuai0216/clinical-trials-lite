Choroidal neovascularization consists of abnormal blood vessels originating from the choroid and can lead to hemorrhage, fluid exudation, and fibrosis, resulting in photoreceptor damage and vision loss.\n\nThe safety and efficacy of brolucizumab has been demonstrated in 2 randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active controlled Phase 3 studies in nAMD patients (RTH258-C001 and RTH258-C002). Anatomical changes were evaluated in these studies using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which relied on indirect parameters for the diagnosis of active CNV. The OCT-angiography (OCT A) that directly visualize retinal circulation and image CNV and vascular diseases of the retina was not included in previous brolucizumab studies.\n\nThis single-arm, open-label, multicenter study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of brolucizumab 6 mg in patients with nAMD.\n\nOCT-A was used in this study to assess the morphological response of patients to brolucizumab in terms of percentage change in CNV lesion area in the short term (i.e. at Week 12) and in the long term (i.e. at Week 48), as well as changes in other OCT-A features up to Week 48.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change in Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) Lesion Area Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography-Angiograph (OCT-A) From Baseline to Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RTH258/Brolucizumab","deltaMin":-79.29,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":40,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37343623"],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/patientsummary/patientsummaries?patientSummaryId=1874"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":210},"commonTop":["Neovascular age-related macular degeneration - Fellow eye","Hypertension","Eye pain - Study eye","Vitreous floaters - Study eye","COVID-19"]}}
