These gene mutations cause low levels of an enzyme needed to harden bone. The purpose of this study was to test the safety and efficacy of a study drug called asfotase alfa (human recombinant tissue non-specific alkaline phosphate fusion protein) to see what effects it has on patients 5 years of age or less with HPP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Effect of Asfotase Alfa Treatment on Skeletal Manifestations of Hypophosphatasia (HPP)","timeFrame":"From Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Asfotase Alfa","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Minute","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Russia","Saudi Arabia","Spain","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32762706","30811537","26529632"],"seeAlso":["http://www.magicfoundation.org","http://www.softbones.org","http://www.hypophosphatasia.com","http://www.hypophosphatasia.com/hcp/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":50,"n":69},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Tooth loss","Injection site erythema","Vomiting","Diarrhoea"]}}
