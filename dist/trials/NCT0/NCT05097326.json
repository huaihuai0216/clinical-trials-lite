Since the Labor Induction versus Expectant Management in Low-Risk Nulliparous Women (ARRIVE) trial supporting that elective induction after 39 weeks decreases cesarean sections and morbidity, rates of elective term inductions are increasing.\n\nAt Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University specifically, approximately 40% of spontaneous vaginal deliveries follow induction of labor, with an average induction time of 20 hours. Previous studies have established the maternal and neonatal safety of mifepristone in term inductions, however, this study will assess the difference in overall time from induction to complete cervical dilation, delivery, and the total time on Labor and Delivery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Uterine Contractions","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 72 hours, from start of labor induction to removal of transcervical balloon","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mifepristone","deltaMin":103,"sd":null},{"arm":"Misoprostol","deltaMin":112,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.44"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.02"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":15},"commonTop":["5 min APGAR <7"]}}
