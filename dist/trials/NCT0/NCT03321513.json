In eyes with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also shown to be successful in many eyes. However, aflibercept was shown to be more effective at improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years. Due to the large cost difference between the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with bevacizumab and then switch to aflibercept depending on the eye's response to bevacizumab treatment. However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as effective at improving vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept. Patients and clinicians do not know if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual acuity. If starting with aflibercept is not better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to aflibercept if needed, the potential cost savings to future patients and the health care system would be substantial. However, if starting with aflibercept is better, then patients, clinicians, and health care providers can make informed decisions for how to best treat patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.\n\nStudy Objectives To compare the efficacy of intravitreous aflibercept with intravitreous bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept if needed in eyes with CI DME and moderate vision loss","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Visual Acuity","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aflibercept- Monotherapy Group","deltaMin":15,"sd":8.5},{"arm":"Bevacizumab-First Group","deltaMin":14,"sd":8.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":54,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35833805"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":61,"n":116},"commonTop":["Cataract","Subconjunctival hemorrhage","Cold","Floaters","Posterior subcapsular cataract"]}}
