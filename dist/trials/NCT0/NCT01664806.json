The appearance of burns are common following laparoscopic cholecystectomy; particularly at the port site of the active electrode. Willson et al found that 9 out of 19 skin biopsies from the skin adjacent to the port site of the monopolar instrument's active electrode were found to have thermal injury by histology. \\[Willson et al. Surg Endosc (1997) 11:653\\] Authors have speculated that using different generator modes may lead to less capacitive coupling; \\[Wu et al Am J Surg (2000) 179: 67\\] although no data exists to support these speculations.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that capacitive coupling electrosurgical injuries from monopolar instruments are occurring during laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations. The investigators hypothesize that use of blend modes will reduce the incidence of capacitive coupling thermal injuries during laparoscopic operations in comparison to coag modes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Histologic Thermal Injury to Epigastric Port Site Skin","timeFrame":"1 day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Blend Mode (Triverse Pencil Valleylab Mode) 30 Watts","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Coag Mode 30 Watts Power","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23739984"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
