Study Investigators will recruit from an ongoing observational cohort study in Cape Town, South Africa, PrEP-PP (recruitment ongoing through July, 2021; NIMH R01MH116771; PI Coates \\& Myer). Findings form this PK sub-study will be used to inform future PrEP in pregnancy and postpartum studies and develop benchmarks of the relative PK between TDF and TAF.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tenofovir Diphosphate (TFV-DP) Levels in Plasma and Intracellular Levels in Pregnant Women on Daily PrEP","timeFrame":"8 week period during Pregnancy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TAF Arm","deltaMin":580,"sd":null},{"arm":"TDF Arm","deltaMin":71,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
