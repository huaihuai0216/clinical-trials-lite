Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits, hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands. Current therapies have limited effectiveness, significant side effects, and can be invasive and costly. Sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) is a novel soft-drug in development for the topical treatment of hyperhidrosis. This Phase 3 study will assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel applied topically to subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Cumulative to Week 48 by Maximum Severity","timeFrame":"All safety subjects, reaching week 48 or not","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gel, 5%","deltaMin":27,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gel, 15%","deltaMin":55,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":102},"commonTop":["Dry Mouth","Vision Blurred","Application site pruritus","Application site pain","Application site dermatitis"]}}
