Pediatric participants (ages 10-19) will be randomized to one of the following treatment regimens: (1) metformin alone or (2) early intensive treatment with basal insulin glargine followed by metformin.\n\nThe primary clinical question RISE will address is: Are improvements in ß-cell function following 12 months of active treatment maintained for 3 months following the withdrawal of therapy? Secondary outcomes will assess durability of glucose tolerance following withdrawal of therapy, and whether biomarkers obtained in the fasting state predict parameters of ß-cell function, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and the response to an intervention.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"ß-cell Response Measured by Hyperglycemic Clamp","timeFrame":"3-months after medication washout (Month 15)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin Alone","deltaMin":4.82,"sd":null},{"arm":"Glargine Followed by Metformin","deltaMin":4.18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":">0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29941498","29941497","28493515","24194506","29941500","36938582","34274407","34135015","34131048","34131047","33436401","32985775","31301210","31178433"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":47},"commonTop":["GI Discomfort","Polyuria or polydipsia","Low blood sugar","Skin rash"]}}
