Safety information on the rate of capsular contracture, rupture, and infection will be collected, and used to help determine device safety.\n\nApproximately 1000 patients at approximately 60 medical centers across the United States were enrolled in this research study. These patients were implanted with silicone breast prostheses and will be monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"10-Year Kaplan-Meier Estimated Cumulative Incidence Rate of Occurrence of Any Reoperation","timeFrame":"10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Primary Augmentation","deltaMin":22.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Primary Reconstruction","deltaMin":52.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Revision Augmentation","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Revision Reconstruction","deltaMin":59.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25158767"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":572},"commonTop":["Baker III Capsular Contracture","Ptosis","Nipple Sensation Changes","Wrinkling","Asymmetry"]}}
