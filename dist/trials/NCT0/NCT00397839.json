Approximately 10% of men =65 years of age are osteoporotic. The proposed study will evaluate efficacy and safety of oral ibandronate given 150 mg once-monthly for 12 months versus placebo in men with primary osteoporosis. Less frequent, once monthly, dosing is expected to improve patient's treatment adherence compared to a weekly dosing regimen.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Percent Change in BMD of the Lumbar Spine From Baseline to Month 12","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.94,"sd":0.709},{"arm":"Ibandronate","deltaMin":3.52,"sd":0.661}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":41,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":47},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Back pain","Nasopharyngitis","Constipation","Nausea"]}}
