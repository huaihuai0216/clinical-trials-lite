The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DAC HYP following single and multiple doses of DAC HYP administered by the PFS in a subset of participants with RRMS and to evaluate the effect of DAC HYP on the PK of probe drugs for cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Anti-DAC HYP Binding Antibodies (ADAbs): Electrochemiluminescent (ECL) Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Assay","timeFrame":"Up to 44 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Main Study","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States","Czechia","Hungary","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27411694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":133},"commonTop":["Multiple sclerosis relapse","Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
