In addition subjects will receive best supportive care which excludes any disease specific anti cancer therapy such as any kinase inhibitor, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery.\n\nTumor assessment will be every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, every 6 weeks for the next 3 months (through month 6), and every 8 weeks until the end of treatment, or more frequently if clinically indicated. Tumor assessments include CT or MRI and will be performed until tumor progression is seen in a central radiology review.\n\nSubjects receiving placebo who experience disease progression may be offered active treatment.\n\nSubjects who experience progression during regorafenib treatment may continue open label treatment.\n\nAll subjects will enter the Survival Follow-up Period upon discontinuation of randomized study treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"From randomization of the first subject until approximately 144 progression-free survival events had occurred (study duration approximately one year)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)","deltaMin":147,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":57,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","Finland","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Poland","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23177515","24957256","25655899","22421192"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/","http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":41},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome","Fatigue","Diarrhea","Mucositis oral"]}}
