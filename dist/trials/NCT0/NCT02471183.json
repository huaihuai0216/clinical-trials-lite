During the study, the treatment with inhaled treprostinil will be tapered off and simultaneously replaced with an oral treatment (selexipag) targeting the disease in a similar way. The purpose of the study is i) to investigate the safety and tolerability of oral selexipag in patients who transition from inhaled treprostinil, ii) to investigate the effects of oral selexipag on PAH severity and exercise ability before and after transition, and iii) to gain new information about the patients experience taking oral selexipag compared to inhaled treprostinil. Study participants may stay in the study until the FDA has granted marketing authorization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Sustained Treatment Transition","timeFrame":"At Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Selexipag","deltaMin":82.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30391194"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":34},"commonTop":["Headache","Diarrhoea","Pain in jaw","Dyspnoea","Myalgia"]}}
