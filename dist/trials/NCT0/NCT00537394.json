Long-term control of HIV requires at least two anti-HIV drugs that are active against the virus. Drug resistance is a problem for many treatment-experienced, HIV-infected people. The purpose of this study was to determine the benefit of adding a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) to a new anti-HIV drug regimen for the suppression of HIV.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent of Participants With Regimen Failure, Defined as a Confirmed Virologic Failure or Discontinuation of Randomized NRTI Component of Study Treatment","timeFrame":"From study entry to end of Week 48 evaluation window","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Add NRTIs (Randomized) to Individualized Regimen (cPSS > 2.0)","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Omit NRTIs (Randomized) From Individualized Regimen(cPSS > 2)","deltaMin":29.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":64,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17503659","17502727","17219736","17461850","31135883","26595748"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":58,"n":180},"commonTop":["Blood cholesterol abnormal","Blood glucose abnormal","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Low density lipoprotein abnormal","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
