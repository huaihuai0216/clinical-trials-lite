The investigators have, therefore, designed this study to investigate the central hypothesis that in patients with type 1 diabetes, Liraglutide has a glucose lowering effect. A major secondary objective of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for its glucose lowering effects and those involved in reducing the insulin dose. The specific aims of this proposal are:\n\nHypothesis 1: Treatment with Liraglutide in patients with type 1 diabetes decreases HbA1c, fasting, postprandial and the overall mean glucose concentrations while decreasing the dose of insulin required.\n\nHypothesis 2: Treatment with Liraglutide in patients with type 1 diabetes decreases basal and postprandial glucagon concentrations and increases basal and postprandial C-peptide concentrations.\n\nHypothesis 3: Treatment with Liraglutide in patients with type 1 diabetes delays gastric emptying.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"HbA1c (%)","timeFrame":"52 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide","deltaMin":7.92,"sd":0.15},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.48,"sd":0.18}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":26},"commonTop":[]}}
