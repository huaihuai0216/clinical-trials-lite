Since we have shown (Evans \\& Foltin, 2006) that oral micronized PROG attenuates the positive subjective effects of smoked cocaine in females, but not in males, and we have preliminary data indicating that oral micronized PROG also reduces smoked cocaine self-administration in the laboratory, PROG appears to be an ideal potential candidate medication to evaluate in cocaine-dependent women. Prior to randomization to treatment, women will reside inpatient for one week to ensure cocaine abstinence since one of the primary outcome measures will be time to cocaine relapse.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cocaine Abstinence Based on Urine Toxicology Results","timeFrame":"during last 3 weeks of the trial","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Matched Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oral Micronized Progesterone","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36095308"],"seeAlso":["http://www.stars.columbia.edu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["headache","fatigue","breast tenderness","abdominal pain/cramps","depression"]}}
