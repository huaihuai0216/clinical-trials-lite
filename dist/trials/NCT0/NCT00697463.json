Teriparatide \\[PTH(1-34)\\], which is FDA approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, works by stimulating bone formation. The investigators hypothesize that teriparatide will significantly increase bone density (BMD) and improve bone structure in premenopausal women with IOP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Lumbar Spine Bone Density by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Month 18 or 24 reported","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Women With Idiopathic Osteoporosis (IOP)","deltaMin":10.8,"sd":8.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":["Hypercalciuria","Hypercalcemia","Distal radius fracture"]}}
