Only men enrolled in the T Trial are eligible to participate in these trials.\n\n* The Cardiovascular Trial will examine if testosterone treatment results in more favorable changes in cardiovascular risk factors, compared to placebo.\n* The Bone Trial will test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment will increase volumetric trabecular bone mineral density (vBMD) of the lumbar spine as measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT), compared with placebo treatment.\n\nA Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study is also being conducted within the context of the interventional T Trial. It will examine the variability of the serum testosterone (T) concentration after application of testosterone gel or placebo, four months after the start of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sexual Function Trial - Change in Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire Question 4 (PDQ-Q4) From Baseline to Month 12","timeFrame":"1 year (change from baseline to month 3, 6, 9 and 12)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AndroGel® (Testosterone Gel)","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":1.3},{"arm":"Placebo Gel","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":1.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38224135","35041751","32785689","31784747","30366567","29253154","28241356","28241355","28241237","28241231","27355400","26886521","26554661","25548978","21761342"],"seeAlso":["http://www.trial.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":183,"n":394},"commonTop":["Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders","Infections and infestations","Injury poisoning and procedural complications","Nervous system disorders","General disorders and administration site conditions"]}}
