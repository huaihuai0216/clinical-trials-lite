Sixty participants will be recruited into a 16-week randomized pilot study. Thirty participants (control condition) will receive standard smoking cessation counseling (NRT-S) and will initiate an 8-week course of combination nicotine patch and lozenge (or gum, based on preference) on quit date (week 4), consistent with recommended guidelines based on smoking rate. Thirty participants (active condition) will start NRT patch 3 weeks prior to quit date, followed by an 8-week course of combination nicotine patch and lozenge (or gum, based on preference), initiated on quit date. The investigators will examine dependence, urge to smoke and self-efficacy for quitting prior to and following quit date. The investigators will also examine differences in quit attempts and biochemically validated smoking abstinence between the control and active conditions at weeks 8, 12, and 16.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Adherence to NRT","timeFrame":"week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Preloading","deltaMin":47.4,"sd":13.2},{"arm":"Standard Treatment","deltaMin":32.7,"sd":21.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":[]}}
