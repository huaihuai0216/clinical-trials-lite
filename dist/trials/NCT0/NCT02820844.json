This study has been planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK1358820 in Japanese OAB patients with urinary incontinence whose symptoms have not been adequately managed with other medications for OAB.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the superiority of a single dose treatment of GSK1358820 100 units (U) compared with placebo.\n\nThe study comprises a screening phase up to 28 days, followed by a double-blind treatment phase of 12 to 48 weeks wherein subjects will receive a single treatment of either GSK1358820 100 U injection or Placebo injection, in a ratio of 1:1, with further stratification within the treatment arms according to the number of urinary urge incontinence episodes during screening. Subjects meeting the criteria for re-treatment will receive a second and third treatment. Each re-treatment will be with open-label GSK1358820 100 U injection, and will be spaced at least 12 weeks from the previous treatment.\n\nThe total duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including screening and the 48-week treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 12 After the First Treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) and Week 12 in Treatment Cycle 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Cycle 1: Placebo","deltaMin":-1.25,"sd":0.375},{"arm":"Treatment Cycle 1: GSK1358820 100 U","deltaMin":-3.42,"sd":0.381}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31957922","34292493"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":124},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Cystitis","Dysuria","Residual urine volume increased"]}}
