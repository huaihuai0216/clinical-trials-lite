The primary objective of this study was to assess the proportion of subjects who were headache pain free at two hours after patch activation.\n\nKey secondary objectives included:\n\n1. The proportion of subjects who were nausea free at two hours after patch activation.\n2. The proportion of subjects who were photophobia free at two hours after patch activation.\n3.
