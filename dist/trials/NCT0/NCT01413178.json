The safety of this combination therapy will also be studied.\n\nMelphalan and busulfan are designed to damage the DNA (genetic material) of cells, which may cause cancer cells to die.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"3 years after transplant","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Busulfan + Melphalan","deltaMin":72,"sd":null},{"arm":"Melphalan","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30910541"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":73,"n":104},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhea","Mucositis","Fluid overload","Infection"]}}
