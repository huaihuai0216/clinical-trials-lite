After transplant many survivors may feel stressed or may be unsure of what health care they need. A self-management program called \"INSPIRE,\" along with a personalized survivorship care plan may improve stress and health care for transplant survivors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD)","timeFrame":"Up to 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group I (INSPIRE, Survivorship Care Plan)","deltaMin":23.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group II (Usual Care)","deltaMin":22.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.90"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":184},"commonTop":[]}}
