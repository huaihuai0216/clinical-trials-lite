Participants who completed the lead-in Phase 3 Study M21-309 and met eligibility requirements could enroll in this open-label extension study.\n\nPlanned study enrollment was approximately 270 participants. Participants who met treatment criteria could receive up to 3 administrations of BOTOX. Day 1 (study entry) was the same day as Day 120/study exit visit of the lead-in Phase 3 study. The first administration of study drug could occur at the Day 1 visit, and the last administration of study drug could occur at the Day 180 visit (60 days prior to Day 240/study exit). Once a subject was enrolled in this study, monthly follow-up visits occurred.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","timeFrame":"371 days (from enrollment in the lead-in study M21-309 through end of study M21-323)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo (Lead-in)","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"BOTOX (Cycle 1)","deltaMin":74,"sd":null},{"arm":"BOTOX (Cycle 2)","deltaMin":46,"sd":null},{"arm":"BOTOX (Cycle 3)","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"BOTOX (Cycle 4)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"BOTOX (All Treatment Cycles)","deltaMin":111,"sd":null},{"arm":"Total","deltaMin":127,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.rxabbvie.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":292},"commonTop":["COVID-19","INJECTION SITE BRUISING","NASOPHARYNGITIS"]}}
