The study will also assess the immunological response (measure the amount of antibodies, i.e. proteins that fight off germs) produced by children after they have been given the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine at 5 and 12 months or 12 months of age. In addition, reactions at the injection site will be assessed during the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) of Serotype-Specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Antibodies 1 Month After the Toddler Dose","timeFrame":"1 month after the toddler dose (13 months of age)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC/13vPnC","deltaMin":5.27,"sd":null},{"arm":"13vPnC","deltaMin":5.06,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"140 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=6096A1-3012&StudyName=Study%20Evaluating%2013-valent%20Pneumococcal%20Conjugate%20Vaccine%20in%20Healthy%20Children"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":118},"commonTop":["Irritability","Redness (Any)","Tenderness (Any)","Swelling (Any)","Redness (Mild)"]}}
