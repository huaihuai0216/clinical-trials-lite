The study will consist of three cohorts. Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 will consist of ND subjects (Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent \\[ESA\\] users and ESA non-users) randomized to receive GSK1278863 or epoetin beta pegol in a ratio of 1:1. PD subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 2 and will receive GSK1278863. This study consists of a 4-week screening phase, a 52-week treatment phase (including primary efficacy evaluation period \\[Weeks 40 to 52\\]), and a 4-week follow-up phase following the treatment phase. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of GSK1278863 to epoetin beta pegol based on mean hemoglobin (Hgb) during the primary efficacy evaluation period in ND subjects. ESA non-users from Cohort 1 will be excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. Study results will be used as pivotal study data for an NDA submitted for GSK1278863 for the treatment of renal anemia in Japan.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Hemoglobin (Hgb) During the Primary Efficacy Evaluation Period (Weeks 40 to 52) in ND Participants","timeFrame":"Weeks 40 to 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Daprodustat in ND Participants","deltaMin":11.97,"sd":0.061},{"arm":"Epoetin Beta Pegol in ND Participants","deltaMin":11.86,"sd":0.063}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":56,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36005278","33561857"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":149},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Constipation","Back pain","Hyperkalaemia","Pruritus"]}}
