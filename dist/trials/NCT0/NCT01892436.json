It aimed to provide continuous treatment with secukinumab in pre-filled syringes (PFS) for subjects who completed the core study CAIN457F2306, to obtain further long term efficacy, safety and tolerability information in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis receiving secukinumab every 4 weeks. At Week 104 of the study CAIN457F2306, eligible subjects completed the assessments associated with the core study visit and subsequently continued in this extension study on the same dose that they were receiving during the core study. The regular assessments of disease activity ensure that subjects who are experienced worsening of disease in any of the treatment groups could exit the study upon their own wish or based on the advice of the investigator at any time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Subject Who Reached (American College of Rheumatology Score of 20) ACR20","timeFrame":"weeks 116, 128, 140, 156, 180, 208, 232 and 260","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Secukinumab 75mg","deltaMin":71.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Secukinumab 150mg","deltaMin":73.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo - AIN457A 75mg","deltaMin":73.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo - AIN457 150mg","deltaMin":73.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":94,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Israel","Italy","Philippines","Poland","Russia","Singapore","Slovakia","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30167329"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":48,"n":292},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Bronchitis","Hypertension"]}}
