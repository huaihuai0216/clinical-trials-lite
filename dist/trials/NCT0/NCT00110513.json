The trial focused on patients with confirmed hereditary antithrombin deficiency who were undergoing a surgical procedure or induced/spontaneous labor and delivery, and/or caesarean section. The study assessed the incidence of thromboembolic events following prophylactic intravenous administration of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) to patients with hereditary antithrombin (AT) deficiency in situations usually associated with a high risk for thromboembolic events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Thromboembolic Events Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) and/or Thromboembolic Events Other Than Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)","timeFrame":"During treatment and follow up period of 7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Recombinant Human Antithrombin (rhAT) Infusion","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24335249"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":18},"commonTop":["Anemia","Vomiting","Vaginal Laceration","Headache","Non-Cardiac Chest Pain"]}}
