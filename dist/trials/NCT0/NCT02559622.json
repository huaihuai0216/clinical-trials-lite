Furthermore soluble biomarkers were assessed to evaluate the influence of secukinumab on cardiovascular risk. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in a sub-population to assess the treatment effect on arterial vessel wall morphometry in atherosclerosis prone vascular beds.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) at Week 12 Followed by Secukinumab 300 mg vs Pooled Placebo Treatment","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Secukinumab 300 mg","deltaMin":5.23,"sd":5.3},{"arm":"Placebo (Pooled)","deltaMin":3.65,"sd":4.07}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2230"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":48},"commonTop":["NASOPHARYNGITIS","HEADACHE","ARTHRALGIA","BACK PAIN","RHINITIS"]}}
