Two co-primary endpoints will be used in the study: reduction of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms at the end of Week 4 of the double-blind treatment phase measured by the 7 day average instantaneous AM diary symptom scores, and reduction in total polyp grade (sum of scores from both nasal cavities) over the 16 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase as determined by the Lildholdt scale score measured by nasoendoscopy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in 7-day Average Instantaneous Morning Diary Congestion/Obstruction Symptoms","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 4 of the double-blind treatment phase","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.26,"sd":0.08},{"arm":"OPN-375 100 μg BID","deltaMin":-0.53,"sd":0.08},{"arm":"OPN-375 200 μg BID","deltaMin":-0.56,"sd":0.08},{"arm":"OPN-375 400 μg BID","deltaMin":-0.67,"sd":0.08}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":30},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35437059","34753535"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":82},"commonTop":["Epistaxis (Found on Nasoendoscopy)","Epistaxis (Spontaneously Reported by Subject)","Nasal Mucosal Disorder","Acute Sinusitis","Nasal Septal Ulceration"]}}
