The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FSC) in subjects with COPD. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening will complete a 7 to 14 day Run-in period. At the end of the run-in period, approximately 710 eligible subjects will be equally randomized (to complete at least 568 evaluable subjects) to one of the 2 treatment groups for 12 weeks: 1. UMEC/VI 62.5/25 micrograms (mcg) administered as one inhalation once-daily in the morning via the Novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) + placebo administered as one inhalation each morning and evening via single multidose powdered inhaler (ACCUHALER/DISKUS) or 2. FSC 250/50 mcg administered as one inhalation each morning and evening via ACCUHALER/DISKUS + placebo administered once-daily in the morning via NDPI. A safety Follow-up assessment will be conducted approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment (Early Withdrawal, if applicable). The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 15 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in 24-hour Weighted-mean Serial FEV1 on Treatment Day 84","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 84","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg QD","deltaMin":0.165,"sd":0.013},{"arm":"FSC 250/50 µg BID","deltaMin":0.091,"sd":0.0131}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":59,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Chile","Greece","Peru","Romania","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26006754"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":353},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
