The investigators will test the hypothesis that pregnant women who are anemic in the second and third trimester are more likely to significantly increase their hemoglobin with intravenous iron as opposed to the usual standard of care, oral iron.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Median Change in Hemoglobin Value Before and After Intervention","timeFrame":"From enrollment to four weeks post-enrollment (may have been up to 6 weeks post-enrollment)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Iron","deltaMin":10.95,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intravenous Iron","deltaMin":11.45,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Constipation","Nausea/ Vomiting","Abdominal pain","Edema/ Swelling of limbs","Body aches/ pains"]}}
