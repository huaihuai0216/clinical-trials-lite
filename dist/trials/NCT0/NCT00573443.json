An additional objective is to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two different doses of AVP-923 in a subset of the study population.\n\nPseudobulbar Affect (PBA) is a condition characterized by involuntary, sudden and frequent episodes of laughing and/or crying out of proportion or incongruous to the underlying emotion of happiness or sadness Other terms used to describe this condition include emotional lability, emotionalism, emotional incontinence, emotional discontrol, excessive emotionalism, and pathological laughing and crying. The outbursts can occur spontaneously or in response to provocative stimuli such as questions or events.\n\nA body of evidence suggests that PBA can be modulated through pharmacologic intervention.\n\nDextromethorphan (DM) is a low-affinity uncompetitive antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, reducing the level of excitatory activity. DM also acts at the phencyclidine-binding site, which is part of the NMDA receptor complex. DM is a sigma receptor agonist, suppressing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.\n\nQuinidine (Q) is a known potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), that decreases the metabolism of dextromethorphan and helps to achieve sustained and therapeutic levels of this drug.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"PBA Episode Rate Ratio (Post/Pre), Regression Adjusted","timeFrame":"Baseline to Day 84","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AVP-923-30","deltaMin":0.247,"sd":3.447},{"arm":"AVP-923-20","deltaMin":0.237,"sd":6.048},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.465,"sd":6.642}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":62,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20839238"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":110},"commonTop":["FALL","HEADACHE","FATIGUE","DIZZINESS","NAUSEA"]}}
