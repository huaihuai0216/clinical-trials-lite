These attacks are often painful and disabling, and, in some cases, life-threatening. \"HAE\" is caused by mutations in the \"C1INH\" gene that lead to a decrease in the blood level of functional \"C1INH\". This multi-center study was designed to assess the safety and tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of recombinant human C1 inhibitor (\"rhC1INH\") in the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema attacks.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Beginning of Relief of Symptoms","timeFrame":"up to 48 hours after study drug administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"100 IU/kg \"rhC1INH\"","deltaMin":68,"sd":null},{"arm":"50 IU/kg \"rhC1INH\"","deltaMin":122,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":258,"sd":null},{"arm":"50 IU/kg Open-label \"rhC1INH\"","deltaMin":62.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20920772","28284978","23535096"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":["headache","vertigo","diarrhea","nausea","sinusitis"]}}
