If blood pressure is increased with NOS inhibition in persons with tetraplegia, this would improve our treatment of the condition of low blood pressure during seated postures in individuals with tetraplegia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Systolic Blood Pressure During Head-up Tilt","timeFrame":"Average systolic blood pressure during head-up tilt (45 degrees) comparing active drug (L-NAME: 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) to placebo.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tetraplegic Systolic Blood Pressure Responses to Placebo","deltaMin":91.8,"sd":20.96},{"arm":"Control Systolic Blood Pressure Responses to Placebo","deltaMin":108.1,"sd":12.18},{"arm":"Tetraplegic Systolic Blood Pressure Responses to L-NAME 1.0 mg","deltaMin":112.04,"sd":28.01},{"arm":"Tetraplegic Systolic Blood Pressure Responses to L-NAME 2.0 mg","deltaMin":129.94,"sd":26.43}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17385265","17965289","19651280","21762873","23700789"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":9},"commonTop":[]}}
