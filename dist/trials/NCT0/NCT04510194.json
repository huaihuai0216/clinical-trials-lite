Metformin vs fluvoxamine vs ivermectin vs metformin+fluvoxamine vs metformin+ivermectin is superior to placebo in non-hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 disease for preventing Covid-19 disease progression.\n2. To understand if the active treatment arms are superior to placebo in improving viral load, serologic markers associated with Covid-19, and gut microbiome in non-hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n3. To understand if any of the active treatment arms prevent long-covid syndrome, PASC (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Count of Participants With Hypoxia Only","timeFrame":"14 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Metformin Only Group","deltaMin":147,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Placebo Group","deltaMin":158,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Ivermectin Only Group","deltaMin":88,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Fluvoxamine Only Group","deltaMin":73,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Metformin and Fluvoxamine Group","deltaMin":71,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Metformin and Ivermectin Group","deltaMin":96,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32353859","38947738","38690892","37302406","36124697","36070710","35180412"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":284},"commonTop":["neuropathy","dizziness","weakness in leg/arms"]}}
