Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and oropharyngeal (OP) swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic. In this case, these visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. The primary outcome is time to recovery by Day 29.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Recovery for Participants With Baseline Ordinal Score 4, 5 and 6","timeFrame":"Day 1 through Day 29","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Remdesivir Plus Interferon Beta-1a","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Remdesivir Plus Placebo","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.880"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":64,"countries":["United States","Japan","Mexico","Singapore","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36442063","34672949","34473343","33148977"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":442},"commonTop":["Lymphocyte count decreased","Glomerular filtration rate decreased","Haemoglobin decreased","Acute kidney injury","Deep vein thrombosis"]}}
