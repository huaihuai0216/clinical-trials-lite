Approximately 297 subjects aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD and comorbid impulsive aggression will be recruited in this study. The frequency of impulsive aggression behaviors will be assessed as a primary outcome. Additionally, the severity and improvement in impulsive aggression and quality of life measures for the subject and caregiver will be assessed using validated scales.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy and Safety of SPN-810 on the Frequency of Impulsive Aggression (IA) Measured by the Impulsive Aggression Diary","timeFrame":"Daily measure from Visit 2 (Week -2) to Visit 6 (Week 5) for a total of 7 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-54.12,"sd":null},{"arm":"High Dose SPN-810 (36 mg)","deltaMin":-51.64,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9383"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":94},"commonTop":["Headache","Vomiting","Blood prolactin increase"]}}
