Its effect on other symptoms such as drowsiness, depression, sleeplessness, physical activity, and anxiety will also be studied. Another goal of this study is to learn if receiving a phone call by a nurse improves fatigue in patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Fatigue Subscale Score","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 15","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methylphenidate (MP) + Nursing Telephone Intervention (NTI)","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Methylphenidate (MP) + Control Telephone Intervention (CTI)","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (PL)+ Nursing Telephone Intervention (NTI)","deltaMin":8.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (PL) + Control Telephone Intervention (CTI)","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.16"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27148765","23690414"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":45},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Pain","Mood Alteration","Nausea","Hypertension"]}}
