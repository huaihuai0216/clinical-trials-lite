Patients randomized to romiplostim must complete the taper or discontinuation of medical SOC for ITP as soon as medically feasible after the initiation of romiplostim. After the completion or discontinuation of the study treatment period, any participant who does not transfer in to another romiplostim study will complete a 6-month Safety Follow-up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Splenectomy During 52-Week Treatment Period","timeFrame":"52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Romiplostim","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["22460421","21067381"],"seeAlso":["http://download.veritasmedicine.com/REGFILES/amgen/Amgen_results_disclaimer.pdf","http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":73},"commonTop":["Headache","Fatigue","Nasopharyngitis","Epistaxis","Petechiae"]}}
