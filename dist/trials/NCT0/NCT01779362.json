Adult participants (ages 20-65) will be randomized to one of the following treatment regimens: (1) blinded placebo, (2) blinded metformin alone, (3) early intensive insulin treatment with basal insulin glargine followed by open-label metformin, (4) the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) liraglutide plus open-label metformin.\n\nThe primary clinical question RISE will address is: Are improvements in ß-cell function following 12 months of active treatment maintained for 3 months following the withdrawal of therapy? Secondary outcomes will assess durability of glucose tolerance following withdrawal of therapy, and whether biomarkers obtained in the fasting state predict parameters of ß-cell function, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and the response to an intervention.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"ß-cell Response Measured by Hyperglycemic Clamp","timeFrame":"3-months after medication washout (Month 15)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin Alone","deltaMin":3.65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Glargine Followed by Metformin","deltaMin":3.58,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Liraglutide + Metformin","deltaMin":3.73,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":">0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24194506","28493515","36938582","35894078","34274407","34135015","34131048","34131047","33436401","32501595","31301210","31178434","31178433","29941498","29941497"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":65},"commonTop":["GI Symptoms","Any low blood sugar","Skin rash","Diabetes symptoms"]}}
