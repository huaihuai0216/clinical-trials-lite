Our overall goal is to determine whether, in patients with familial dysautonomia (FD), there is a component of airway obstruction that is reversible. To this end, we will evaluate airway resistance before and after receiving the anti-cholinergic ipratropium (Atrovent ®) and the beta-2-agonist albuterol (ProVentil®/Ventolin®). We predict that the response to either drug will depend on the underlying level of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and airway tone. We will then determine the cardiovascular effects of inhaled ipratropium and albuterol in patients with FD. Because patients with FD have fewer sympathetic neurons and denervation supersenstivity, we predict that following albuterol inhalation, there will be non-selective activation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, because of a congenital defect in the afferent baroreceptor neurons that sense blood pressure, we suspect that the resulting vasoconstriction will be unopposed leading to a pressor effect. We hypothesize that inhalation of the anti-cholinergic ipratopium will produce little rise in heart rate, due to the extent of parasympathetic denervation to the heart.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline of Forced Vital Capacity","timeFrame":"Pre and 30 minutes post study drug administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Albuterol-sulphate","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":13.6},{"arm":"Ipratropium-bromide (Atrovent ®)","deltaMin":4.7,"sd":10.9},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.9,"sd":10.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
