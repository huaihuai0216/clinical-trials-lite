Due to this deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ system dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of every other week dosing of Gene-Activated® Human Glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB, velaglucerase alfa) at doses of 45 and 60 U/kg in treatment-naïve patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to 12 Months in Hemoglobin Concentration for the 60 U/kg Treatment Group.","timeFrame":"Week 53","effectByArm":[{"arm":"VPRIV® (60 U/kg, IV, Every Other Week)","deltaMin":2.429,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["Argentina","Israel","Paraguay","Russia","Tunisia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27839979"],"seeAlso":["http://www.vpriv.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":["Headache","Hypotension","Petechiae","Thrombocytopenia","Dizziness"]}}
