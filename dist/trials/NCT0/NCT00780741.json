As part of the primary objective, the study will determine the proportion of eyes experiencing spontaneous resolution among subjects randomized to the deferred probing group.\n\nThe secondary objectives are:\n\n1. To determine the success proportion for eyes undergoing immediate office probing as an initial procedure.\n2. To determine the success proportion for eyes undergoing deferred facility probing as an initial procedure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Participants With Treatment Success","timeFrame":"18 months of age","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Office Probing - Participants With Unilateral NLDO","deltaMin":0.92,"sd":null},{"arm":"Deferred Facility Probing - Participants With Unilateral NLDO","deltaMin":0.82,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.09"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22801833","23954210","24568978","23229693"],"seeAlso":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23229693","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3537230/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":82},"commonTop":[]}}
