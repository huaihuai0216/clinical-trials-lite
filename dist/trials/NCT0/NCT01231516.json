The study will be conducted in at least 688 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral experienced, integrase-naïve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, each added to an investigator selected background regimen consisting of at least one fully active agent plus no more than one second single agent which may or may not be active. Antiviral activity, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and development of viral resistance will be evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48","timeFrame":"At Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG 50 mg OD","deltaMin":71,"sd":null},{"arm":"RAL 400 mg BID","deltaMin":64,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.030"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":180,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","France","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23830355"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":73,"n":357},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Influenza","Cough"]}}
