Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. It is not yet know whether giving zoledronate together with thalidomide is more effective than zoledronate alone in treating multiple myeloma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate and thalidomide see how well they work compared with zoledronate alone in treating patients with early stage multiple myeloma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Disease Progression (TTP)","timeFrame":"randomization to progression (up to 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I: Thal/ZLD","deltaMin":2.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II: ZLD","deltaMin":1.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.02"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22902362"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":35},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Constipation","Depressed level of consciousness","Rash/Desquamation"]}}
