Previous studies have demonstrated improvements in lung function, mucociliary clearance, changes in physical properties of mucus, 24 hour sputum weight and quality of life. The results of this study are to further investigate and confirm these findings in addition to examine the effect on antibiotic use and chest infections. It is hypothesised that inhaled mannitol will have beneficial effects compared to a control treatment. An open label phase of 26 weeks duration will follow the blinded 26 week phase. During the open label phase all subjects will receive active treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Absolute FEV1 From Baseline Over 26 Weeks","timeFrame":"26 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mannitol 400mg","deltaMin":106.53,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":52.38,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.059"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.041"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":53,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16551221","15691238","12396422","11921459","11171717","10543292","10351929","9426077","18339790","32358807","22198974"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":184},"commonTop":["Condition Aggravated","Headache","Cough","Pharyngolaryngeal pain","Pyrexia"]}}
