Keratotic lesions (i.e., AK lesions and warts) in this population were highly associated with development of SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) also with 10 times higher mortality rate because of SCC than expected. The risk of developing skin cancer, predominantly SCC and BCC (Basal Cell Carcinoma), increased with graft survival time and the length of immunosuppressive treatment period.\n\nThe higher risk of developing skin malignancy and more aggressive skin malignancies in this population, indicated the need for early removal of these pre-malignant lesions.\n\nIn this study, two contralateral areas (5x10 cm\\^2) with skin lesions within the participant were compared. One area was received Metvix PDT at defined intervals and the other was received lesion specific treatment at the discretion of the investigator. The primary endpoint was the accumulated number of new lesions during the study and number of AK lesions that showed complete response 3 months after baseline. Secondary endpoints were number of BCC lesions that showed complete response, number of recurrent lesions, assessment of cosmetic outcome and safety.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Accumulated New Skin Lesions at Month 3","timeFrame":"At Month 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metvix速- PDT (Treatment Area)","deltaMin":65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Contralateral Control Area","deltaMin":103,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0120"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["Denmark","Germany","Norway","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":81},"commonTop":["Pain of Skin","Erythema","Scab","Actinic Keratosis","Blister"]}}
