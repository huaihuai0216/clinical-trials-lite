The study is designed to demonstrate the non inferior antiviral activity of DTG + 3TC regimen to that of DTG + TDF/FTC FDC and will characterise the long term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG plus 3TC through Week 148. Approximately, 700 participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG + 3TC or DTG + TDF/FTC FDC. Participants will be stratified by screening HIV 1 ribonucleotide nucleic acid (RNA) levels and by screening CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) cell count.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies/mL (c/mL) at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG + 3TC - Double-blind Phase","deltaMin":93,"sd":null},{"arm":"DTG + TDF/FTC - Double-blind Phase","deltaMin":94,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":105,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Peru","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30420123","40134635","34913844"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":39,"n":360},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Syphilis"]}}
