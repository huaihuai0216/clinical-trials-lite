The primary objective of this study is to establish the non-inferiority of the efficacy of the FSC 250/50 mcg capsule-based inhaler compared to the FSC 250/50 mcg multi-dose inhaler administered BID. The study consists of 6 phases: Pre-screening, Screening/Run-in (3 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks), Washout (minimum 4 weeks), Treatment Period 2 (12 weeks) and Follow-up (1 week). The total duration of the study for each subject will be at least 32 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Trough Morning Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 85","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 85 of each treatment period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FSC Capsule-Based Unit Dose DPI","deltaMin":0.116,"sd":0.0116},{"arm":"FSC Multi-Dose DPI","deltaMin":0.091,"sd":0.0116}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["Argentina","Mexico","Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28115223"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":426},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
