The two drugs work in two different mechanisms that help each other, so there is a reason to believe that their combined activity will be better than each individual drug, and that lower doses can be used without losing the therapeutic effect. Thus, the development of P2B001 is intended to provide a combination of low doses of these two drugs, in an improved formulation, that is hoped to be more effective in controlling Parkinson's disease symptoms and with less side effects than each of the drugs taken alone or the current available commercial drugs taken together. In a previously completed clinical trial a significant improvement in Parkinson's disease symptoms was seen in patients treated with P2B001 compared to patients that were treated with placebo.\n\nIn this phase 3 study , the safety and efficacy of P2B001 will be assessed by comparing P2B001 to its individual components pramipexole and rasagiline. This will be done by monitoring the motor and non-motor symptoms, evaluating responses participants provide on questionnaires relating to Parkinson's disease and quality of life that will be completed on every visit. In addition, this study will also compare P2B001 to a marketed drug of pramipexole ER. Approximately 525 patients will participate in this research study and the participation in this study will last between 14 to 18 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Score (Defined as Sum of Parts II and III, Scores (0-160).","timeFrame":"baseline to week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"P2B001","deltaMin":-7.98,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"Rasagiline Capsule","deltaMin":-4.69,"sd":0.61},{"arm":"Pramipexole Capsule","deltaMin":-5.32,"sd":0.61},{"arm":"Pramipexole Extended Release","deltaMin":-8.35,"sd":0.86}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0018"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":150},"commonTop":["nausea","somnolence","fatigue","dizziness","headache"]}}
