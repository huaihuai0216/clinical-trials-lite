T PET is an established imaging technique that utilizes small amounts of radioactivity attached to very minimal amounts of this tracer. CT utilizes x-rays that traverse body from the outside. CT images provide an exact outline of organs and potential inflammatory tissue where it occurs in patient's body. Combining a PET scan with a CT scan can help make the images easier to interpret. The 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan is done with a very small amount of radioactive tracer call 68- gallium PSMA-11. In patients that have been diagnosed with prostate cancer, a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) appears in large amounts on the surface of the cancerous cells. The radioactive imaging agent (68Ga-PSMA-11) has been designed to circulate through the body and attach itself to the PSMA protein on prostate cancer cells. A PET/CT scan is then used to detect the location of prostate cancer lesions. By gaining access to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans, patients may be safely screened for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy in the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patients Reporting Adverse Reactions","timeFrame":"From the time of injection until the time after imaging scan is complete, up to 1 day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Observational (68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":156},"commonTop":[]}}
