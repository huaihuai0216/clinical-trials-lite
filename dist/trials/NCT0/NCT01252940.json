The FTC/RPV/TDF STR could offer an attractive treatment option to patients who wish to simplify dosing by reducing pill burden or to improve the tolerability of their treatment.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into 2 groups, the FTC/RPV/TDF STR group, in which participants will switch treatment regimens at the start of the study, and the Stay on Baseline Regimen (SBR)/Delayed Switch group, in which participants will remain on their baseline regimen during the first 24 weeks of the study (designed to provide an initial active control), and may switch to the FTC/RPV/TDF STR at the Week 24 visit.\n\nAfter the 48-week study analysis period, participants may continue to receive the FTC/RPV/TDF STR per protocol before switching to a commercially available source.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL at Week 24 (FDA Snapshot Analysis)","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FTC/RPV/TDF","deltaMin":93.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"SBR/Delayed Switch","deltaMin":89.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":111,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Puerto Rico","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":317},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Insomnia"]}}
