Patients will be randomized to receive either aliskiren or enalapril. Weight-group based doses of aliskiren or enalapril will be administered once daily and children will receive study medication in a double-blind manner. This study is being conducted to support monotherapy registration of aliskiren for the treatment of hypertension in pediatric patients 6-17 years of age (age at baseline in Study CSPP100A2365).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) at to End of Study","timeFrame":"Baseline - end of study (Week 52 or Last observation carried forward (LOCF)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aliskiren","deltaMin":-7.63,"sd":1.16},{"arm":"Enalapril","deltaMin":-7.94,"sd":1.14}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0040"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":36,"countries":["United States","Guatemala","Hungary","Poland","Puerto Rico","Slovakia","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33089502"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":105},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Viral infection","Cough","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
