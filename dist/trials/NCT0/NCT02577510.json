The investigators can inject freezing around the nerve to reduce the feeling around the thigh (i.e. anesthesia). Anesthesia, or freezing, of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can reduce pain for patients having A) hip and knee surgery \\[1,2\\], B) removal of a skin graft \\[3\\], and C) wound care. In addition, damage to the LFCN (i.e. Meralgia Paresthetica) has been associated with body armour and gun belt use in military and police personnel \\[4\\]. Although generally a benign condition, compression or injury to this nerve can be painful and require treatment. In addition, the actual variability in sensory distribution for this nerve has not been elucidated in a topographical fashion and will be measured in this study.\n\nFinding the most efficient and effective method for anesthesia of the LFCN can improve and positively impact the quality of pain control for patients. Ultrasound has improved the accuracy and efficiency of various other regional anesthesia techniques, and could also impact the safety. Therefore the investigators hypothesize that ultrasound guided lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block using the subinguinal technique will be statistically more efficacious and efficient when compare to neurostimulation based blockade.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Anesthesia Related Time","timeFrame":"less than 30 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nerve Stimulation","deltaMin":554,"sd":366.9},{"arm":"Ultrasound","deltaMin":480,"sd":251.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["22679542","9805704","22657583","17615854","22151457","21375093","7605755","8608066","22878522"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":["Femoral Block"]}}
