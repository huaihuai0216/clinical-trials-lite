The primary hypothesis of this study is that participants with PD-L1 strong NSCLC will have a longer Progression Free Survival (PFS), as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) when treated with pembrolizumab than when treated with SOC platinum-based chemotherapies.\n\nWith Amendment 09 (20 December 2017), once participants have achieved the study objective or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate at Month 6","timeFrame":"Month 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":62.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"SOC Chemotherapy","deltaMin":50.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["35073727","34543477","33872070","32926507","32305010","31880807","31395089","29129441","27718847"],"seeAlso":["http://merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":79,"n":154},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fatigue","Anaemia","Decreased appetite","Diarrhoea"]}}
