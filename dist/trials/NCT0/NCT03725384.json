Patients with iron deficiency (ID) and IDA can present with a multitude of symptoms including fatigue, restless legs syndrome and pica.Oral iron supplementation is associated with increasing hemoglobin in multiple studies in women, pregnant women and elderly patients.However, the optimal dose and frequency of oral iron supplementation for treatment remains unclear. The current proposed study attempts to address this gap in the literature.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Feasibility of Enrolling Patients in the Trial","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Total Number Screened for Eligbility","deltaMin":85,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35509085","36999886"],"seeAlso":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36999886/","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35509085/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["Constipation","Nausea","Headache","Breathlessness","Heartburn"]}}
