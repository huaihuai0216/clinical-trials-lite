Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether systemic chemotherapy and subtenon (under the conjunctiva of the eye) carboplatin combined with ophthalmic therapy is effective in treating intraocular (within the eyeball) retinoblastoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Group D Eyes - Treatment Failure Within One Year","timeFrame":"One year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment (Chemotherapy, Surgery)","deltaMin":0.52,"sd":0.102299}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Eye disorders - Other, specify","Hearing impaired","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Anorectal infection"]}}
