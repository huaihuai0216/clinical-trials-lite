It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two combination chemotherapy regimens to compare how well they work in treating women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease Free Survival","timeFrame":"9 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Adriamycin + Cyclophosphamide","deltaMin":80.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Fluorouracil + Epirubicin + Cyclophosphamide","deltaMin":79.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":606,"countries":["United States","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35230585","35112166"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":1351},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Anemia","Nausea","Febrile neutropenia","Neutrophil count decreased"]}}
