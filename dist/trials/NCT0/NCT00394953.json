Eligible patients receiving once-weekly intravenous (IV) darbepoetin alfa maintenance treatment will be randomized to receive either intravenous Mircera once a month (at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms/month, depending on the weekly dose of darbepoetin alfa prior to start of study) or intravenous darbepoetin alfa every 2 weeks before switching to once monthly administration. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Lesser Than or Equal to One Gram Per Deciliter Decrease in Average Hemoglobin From Baseline and Maintaining Average Hemoglobin Level Greater Than or Equal to 10.5 g/dL Over Evaluation Period","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week -4 to Week -1) and Evaluation period (Weeks 50 to 53)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MIRCERA","deltaMin":64.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Darbepoetin Alfa","deltaMin":40.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":88,"countries":["Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","Portugal","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36791280","20522670"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":99,"n":245},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Procedural hypotension","Nasopharyngitis","Muscle spasms","Urinary tract infection"]}}
