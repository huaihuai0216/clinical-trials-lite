Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab or pemetrexed disodium alone or in combination is more effective in treating non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying bevacizumab and pemetrexed disodium alone or in combination after induction therapy to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Assessed every 6 weeks during induction therapy and every 3 cycles during maintenance therapy; after discontinuation of study therapy, assessed every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for years 3-5","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Induction Then Maintenance With Bevacizumab)","deltaMin":14.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Induction Then Maintenance With Pemetrexed","deltaMin":15.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C (Induction Then Maintenance With Bevacizumab and Pemetrexed)","deltaMin":16.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.12"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.28"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":20,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":434,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31361535"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":825,"n":1477},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Fatigue","Hypertension","Anorexia","Nausea"]}}
