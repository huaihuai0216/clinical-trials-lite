Study period will be 8 weeks during induction of advanced therapies. The primary aims of this study will be clinical response, as determined by the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI). Secondary outcomes will be improvement in fecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein levels.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Achieved Clinical Response","timeFrame":"8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Advanced Therapy Plus FMD Group","deltaMin":57,"sd":null},{"arm":"Advanced Therapy Without FMD (Medication Only Group)","deltaMin":35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":14},"commonTop":["abdominal pain"]}}
