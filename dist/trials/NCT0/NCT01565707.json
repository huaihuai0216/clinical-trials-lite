For the use in children and adolescent patients a new formulation of solifenacin has been developed.\n\nThis study investigated the effect and safety of solifenacin succinate liquid suspension compared to a non-active drug (placebo) over a 12-week period. The 2 weeks prior to the double blind period was a single-blind placebo run-in period in combination with behavioral urotherapy (Non-interventional diary assisted urotherapy consisting of overactive bladder (OAB) information, awareness, instruction, life-style advice and documentation of voiding habits and symptoms for OAB), followed by a 12 week daily treatment period. The study also investigated how well solifenacin succinate suspension is taken-up by the body and how long it stays in the body during this time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to End of Treatment (EoT) in Mean Volume Voided (MVV) Per Micturition","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Children","deltaMin":13.4,"sd":4.8},{"arm":"Solifenacin Succinate Suspension Children","deltaMin":25.5,"sd":4.8},{"arm":"Placebo Adolescents","deltaMin":6.9,"sd":14.6},{"arm":"Solifenacin Succinate Suspension Adolescents","deltaMin":2.3,"sd":14}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.046"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":46,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Denmark","Mexico","Norway","Philippines","Poland","Serbia and Montenegro","South Africa","South Korea","Sweden","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33231929","32239291","27687820"],"seeAlso":["https://astellasclinicalstudyresults.com/study.aspx?ID=239"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":73},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Electrocardiogram QT prolonged","Headache","Escherichia urinary tract infection"]}}
