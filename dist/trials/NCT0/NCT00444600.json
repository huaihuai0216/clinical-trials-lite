At the present time, it is not known whether intravitreal steroid or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections, with or without laser treatment, are better than just laser by itself. It is possible that one or both of the types of injections, with or without laser treatment, will improve vision more often than will laser without injections. However, even if better vision outcomes are seen with injections, side effects may be more of a problem with the injections than with laser. Therefore, this study is conducted to find out whether the benefits of the injections will outweigh the risks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Visual Acuity (Letters) From Baseline to 1 Year Adjusted for Baseline Visual Acuity","timeFrame":"from baseline to 1 Year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sham+Prompt Laser","deltaMin":3,"sd":13},{"arm":"0.5 mg Ranibizumab+Prompt Laser","deltaMin":9,"sd":11},{"arm":"0.5 mg Ranibizumab+Deferred Laser","deltaMin":9,"sd":12},{"arm":"4 mg Triamcinolone+Prompt Laser","deltaMin":4,"sd":13}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.31"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21459214","22136692","22332211","22965591","23807371","23792486","25719991","30234859","26035510","26746868","20427088","22999634","26802783","25439614","36774994","21571677","20008710"],"seeAlso":["https://public.jaeb.org/drcrnet/pubs"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":130},"commonTop":["Vision Blurred","Eye pain","Intraocular pressure increased","Conjunctival haemorrhage","Cataract"]}}
