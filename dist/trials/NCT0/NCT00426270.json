Octagam 5% is currently registered in about 80 countries. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Octagam 10% in Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) in adults. As Octagam 10% is essentially similar to Octagam 5%, it is expected that Octagam 10% is as efficacious and safe (in respect to viral safety) as Octagam 5%.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response","timeFrame":"Day 2 to Day 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Octagam 10% 1 g/kg/Day","deltaMin":80,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Austria"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20863431"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":116},"commonTop":["Headache","Heart rate increased","Pyrexia","Heart rate decreased","Nausea"]}}
