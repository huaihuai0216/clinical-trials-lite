Prevention and control will depend on the rapid production and worldwide distribution of specific pandemic vaccines. Candidate 'pandemic-like' vaccines must be developed and tested in clinical trials to determine the most optimal formulation and the best vaccination schedule. This study is designed to test in healthy adults aged above 18 years the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of one and two administrations of a candidate pandemic H5N1 vaccine formulated from Split Virus.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Solicited Local Symptoms","timeFrame":"During a 7 day follow-up period after each dose of vaccine and overall.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GSK1562902A 18-60 YOA Group","deltaMin":212,"sd":null},{"arm":"GSK1562902A >60 YOA Group","deltaMin":16,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluarix+Placebo 18-60 YOA Group","deltaMin":39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluarix+Placebo >60 YOA Group","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":40,"countries":["Estonia","France","Germany","Netherlands","Russia","Spain","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18407382"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":3397},"commonTop":["Pain","Fatigue","Myalgia","Headache","Redness"]}}
