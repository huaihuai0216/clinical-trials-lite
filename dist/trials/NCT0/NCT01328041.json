The study will assess DTG 50mg twice daily administered initially with the current failing ART regimen but then with an optimised background ART regimen (OBR) after Day 7. The first analyses will be conducted after the last subject enrolled has completed 24 weeks. Subjects may remain on study after Week 24.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 RNA at Day 8","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dolutegravir 50 mg BID","deltaMin":-1.432,"sd":0.607}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":89,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Italy","Portugal","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23225901","24446523"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":46,"n":183},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Cough","Nausea","Bronchitis","Headache"]}}
