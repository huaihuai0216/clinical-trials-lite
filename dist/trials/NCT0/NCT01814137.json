The aim of the trial is to compare efficacy of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) twice daily (BID) + insulin aspart (IAsp) once daily (OD) versus basal bolus with insulin degludec (IDeg) OD + IAsp three times a day (TID) in controlling glycaemia by evaluating glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c).
