Participants will be randomized to receive 375 milligrams per meter square (mg/m\\^2) rituximab as IV infusion or 1400 milligrams (mg) rituximab SC. In addition, participants will receive standard chemotherapy. Participants who achieved a complete or partial response (PR) after 8 treatment cycles, will receive maintenance treatment for a further maximum number of 12 cycles. Maintenance treatment cycles will be repeated every 8 weeks. This is a two-stage study. Stage 1 was designed to confirm the chosen rituximab SC dose resulting in comparable rituximab serum Ctrough levels compared with rituximab IV, when given as part of induction treatment every 3 weeks. Enrollment for Stage 2 started after the rituximab SC dose was established in Stage 1. Stage 2 aimed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab SC compared with rituximab IV. The anticipated time on study treatment is 96 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Stage I: Trough Serum Concentrations (Ctrough) of IV and SC Rituximab","timeFrame":"Stage I: Cycle (Cy) 7 Day (D) 21 (within 2 hours predose on Cy8) of induction treatment (1 Cy=3 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Stage I: Rituximab IV + Chemotherapy (CHOP/CVP)","deltaMin":83.1,"sd":36.7},{"arm":"Stage I: Rituximab SC + Chemotherapy (CHOP/CVP)","deltaMin":134.6,"sd":43.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":152,"countries":["Australia","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Colombia","Croatia","Denmark","Finland","France","Georgia","Germany","Greece","Italy","Malaysia","Mexico","New Zealand","North Macedonia","Peru","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","Slovakia","South Africa","Spain","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28476440","24521993","24265828","24002601"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":76,"n":210},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Nausea","Constipation","Cough","Fatigue"]}}
