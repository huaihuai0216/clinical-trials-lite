Niraparib is an orally active PARP inhibitor. Niraparib or placebo (in a 2:1 ratio) will be administered once daily continuously during a 28-day cycle. Health-related quality of life will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI), European Quality of Life scale, 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D), and a neuropathy questionnaire. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory values.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of niraparib as maintenance therapy in patients who have platinum sensitive ovarian cancer as assessed by the prolongation of progression free survival (PFS).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Cohort With Germline BReast CAncer Gene (BRCA) Mutation (gBRCA)","timeFrame":"From date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause, up to 7 years 7 months and 4 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"gBRCA Niraparib","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"gBRCA Placebo","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Norway","Poland","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27717299","36970052","39019698","35170751","32981695","31518175","31173551","30026000","29767688"],"seeAlso":["http://www.facingourrisk.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":51,"n":136},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fatigue","Anaemia","Constipation","Vomiting"]}}
