A phototoxic reaction is an irritant reaction of the skin to ultra violet light. In order to find this out the study drug will be applied to the skin of healthy human subjects. By using a solar simulator to generate a UV spectrum similar to that of sunlight the potential of the study drug to produce a superficial reddening of the skin will be measured.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Phototoxic Reaction Evaluation Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score","timeFrame":"Immediately before irradiation, 24 hours after irradiation, and 48 hours after irradiation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phototoxicity Reaction Test","deltaMin":77,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
