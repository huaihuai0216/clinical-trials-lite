The researchers hypothesize that MEC will significantly reduce depressive symptoms and decrease alcohol consumption compared to placebo in patients with depression and alcohol dependence who are on a stable dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Drinking Days","timeFrame":"25 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":17.6,"sd":6.57},{"arm":"Mecamylamine","deltaMin":12.6,"sd":6.57}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.014"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["Relapse to Drinking","Rash","Vomiting/Diarrhea","Worsening of Depression","Calcified Granuloma"]}}
