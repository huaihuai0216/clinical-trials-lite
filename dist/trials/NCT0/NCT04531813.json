The study plans to enroll about 32 healthy female or male participants with the age 18 - 79 years. Researchers will apply on the skin of the upper back between the shoulder blades of the study participants three different patches to cover a small amount of the antifungal cream or 0.3% solution of sodium lauryl sulfate, which is known to cause skin irritation (so called positive control). A third patch will cover a skin area without any product (so called negative control). Participants will return daily to the study center to have new patches containing the test products applied on the same skin area of the back, excluding weekends, for 21 days of continuous skin contact. At each visit the skin will be investigated by the researchers for redness, dryness and other reactions to learn about the skin reaction after repeated application.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cumulative Irritation Total (CIT) Score","timeFrame":"21 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cumulative Irritation Test","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
