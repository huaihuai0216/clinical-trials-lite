All patients will receive infusions of 1000 mg intravenous (IV) MabThera on Days 1 and 15; at Week 24 patients who have demonstrated a moderate or good response will be randomized to receive re-treatment with either 1 or 2 additional infusions of 1000 mg IV MabThera. The anticipated time on study treatment is 2+ years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count and C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) Area Under the Curve (AUC) at Week 104","timeFrame":"Week 104","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Randomized Retreatment Arm A: Rituximab 1000 mg","deltaMin":2761.4,"sd":507.8},{"arm":"Randomized Retreatment Arm B: Rituximab 1000 mg x 2","deltaMin":2666,"sd":490.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":53,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28363827","27964756","23740460","23723317","22127692","21225699"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":66},"commonTop":["Bronchitis","Urinary tract infection","Rheumatoid arthritis","Asthenia","Headache"]}}
