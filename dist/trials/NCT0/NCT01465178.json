The investigators liken this concept to the evolution of cholesterol where initially, total cholesterol was the only measurement, and have since determined the importance of HDL, LDL and triglycerides in evaluating patient status. Similarly, the investigators feel measurement of other vitamin D components such as sulfated vitamin D, circulating vitamin D3 and 3-epi 25-hydroxy vitamin D will offer more comprehensive information about a patient's vitamin D status.\n\nIt is our overarching hypothesis that a \"vitamin D assay panel,\" will enhance understanding of vitamin D status. It is our expectation that the enhanced understanding based on improved measurement capability will ultimately translate to improved definition of vitamin D status and need for supplementation on an individual level.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D3","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 and 4 months post supplementation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2000 IU Vitamin D3","deltaMin":6,"sd":4.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.8,"sd":4.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":31},"commonTop":["diarrhea","Depression"]}}
