GSK Biologicals has developed an HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine (Cervarix TM) which targets the 2 most common oncogenic HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18), found in \\> 70%, approximately, of all cervical cancers. Recently, Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil® \\[quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV-6,11,16,18 L1 VLP) recombinant vaccine\\] has been approved by the FDA for prevention of genital tract cancers and pre-cancers and genital warts in females. Although the GSK HPV vaccine and Gardasil® have different compositions and are expected to have different efficacy profiles, each vaccine targets prevention of HPV-16 and 18 genital tract cancers and pre-cancers. Therefore, a comparison of the immunogenicity of the two vaccines is warranted. This Phase 3b study is designed to compare the immunogenicity of the GSK vaccine (HPV-16/18) to Gardasil® in healthy adult females 18-45 years of age.\n\nThe Protocol Posting has been updated as the study will be extended by 3 additional years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Titers of Anti-human Papilloma Virus 16 (Anti-HPV-16) and Anti-human Papilloma Virus 18 (Anti-HPV-18) Neutralizing Antibodies","timeFrame":"At Month 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix Group","deltaMin":36791.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gardasil Group","deltaMin":10053.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":40,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19684472","22048173","22048172","18845199","25483700","25483701","21157180"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":44,"n":553},"commonTop":["Pain","Fatigue","Headache","Redness","Gastrointestinal"]}}
