Participants will be enrolled at documentation of progression of disease (PD) after 4-6 cycles of first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus a platinum doublet-containing therapy and a minimum of two cycles of bevacizumab maintenance treatment prior to PD. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms to receive either bevacizumab plus SOC treatment or SOC treatment alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to data cut-off date 24 June 2016 (approximately 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bevacizumab + Standard of Care","deltaMin":11.86,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":10.22,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1044"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":179,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Japan","Lebanon","Mexico","Netherlands","Oman","Slovakia","Spain","United Arab Emirates"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30177994","26828788","21705281"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":126,"n":243},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Decreased Appetite","Asthenia"]}}
