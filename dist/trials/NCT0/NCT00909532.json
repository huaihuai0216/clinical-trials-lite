Ivacaftor is a potent and selective CFTR potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein. Potentiators are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties of the channel in the presence of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Absolute Mean Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Through Week 24","timeFrame":"baseline through 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.2,"sd":0.7},{"arm":"150 mg Ivacaftor q12h","deltaMin":10.4,"sd":0.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":65,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Ireland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22047557","28651844","27097977","26135562"],"seeAlso":["http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/","http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/","http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/fdalinks"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":78},"commonTop":["Cystic fibrosis lung","Cough","Oropharyngeal pain","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
