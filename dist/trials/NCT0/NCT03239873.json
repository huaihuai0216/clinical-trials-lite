The primary hypotheses being tested are that antibody response rate and mean antibody titer induced at 6 weeks after a single vaccination by VARIVAX® PE34 Process are non-inferior to those induced by VARIVAX® 2016 commercial process, and that antibody response rate induced by VARIVAX® PE34 Process is acceptable.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Varicella Zoster Virus Antibody Levels ≥5 Glycoprotein Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (gpELISA) Units/mL","timeFrame":"6 weeks (43 days) after vaccination 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"VARIVAX PE34 + M-M-R II","deltaMin":98.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"VARIVAX (2016 CP) + M-M-R II","deltaMin":98.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32429738"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":299},"commonTop":["Injection site erythema","Pyrexia","Injection site pain","Cough","Irritability"]}}
