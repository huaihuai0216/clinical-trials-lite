Compared with the general population, these women are more likely to be overweight or obese. Moreover, weight gain after GDM is significantly associated with T2DM, independent of baseline body weight. Weight gain, particularly increased central adiposity after delivery, is strongly associated with deterioration of β-cell compensation for insulin resistance. Taken together, our findings and other studies support increased abdominal fat as the strongest factor associated with declining B-cell compensation for insulin resistance in prior GDM women at high risk for T2DM. Dapagliflozin is a novel highly selective SGLT2 inhibitor that improves glycemic control by reducing renal glucose reabsorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. Its efficacy and safety has been studied in multiple randomized controlled trials including an add-on to metformin compared with a placebo. To the extent that glucotoxicity contributes to the demise in β-cell function in subjects with impaired glucose, SGLT2 inhibitors also may prove useful in the treatment of \"prediabetes.\" An additional secondary benefit of SGLT2 inhibition is the elimination of calories in the form of glucose. The loss of glucose with attendant caloric loss contributes to weight loss; in addition, improvements in β cell function have been seen. Weight loss seen with SGLT2 inhibitors is similar to that seen with glucagon-like peptide 1 analogs, and may be more acceptable because they are oral agents. A consistent finding in all dapagliflozin studies has been a reduction in blood pressure. The investigators hypothesize that combination dapagliflozin -metformin treatment over a 24-week period will have a greater positive impact on body weight, anthropometric measurements and glycemic and cardiometabolic parameters than dapagliflozin or metformin monotherapy in overweight/obese at-risk women with a history of GDM.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight","timeFrame":"Change from baseline (time 0) to study end (24 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DAPA/MET XR","deltaMin":-21.5,"sd":14},{"arm":"Dapaglifloxin","deltaMin":-12.5,"sd":20},{"arm":"Metformin XR","deltaMin":-4.4,"sd":18}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.032"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33345876"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["Yeast infection","Nausea/diarrhea"]}}
