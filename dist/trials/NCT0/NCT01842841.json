Type 1 Gaucher disease affects an estimated 30,000 persons worldwide and is the most common. Type 1 Gaucher disease does not involve the central nervous system. Patients with Type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration, which leads to early death. Those with Type 3 disease typically display a more sub-acute neurological course, with later onset and slower progression.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of every other week (EOW) dosing of velaglucerase alfa in Japanese patients with Gaucher disease who completed study HGT-GCB-087 and elected to continue treatment with velaglucerase alfa.\n\nVelaglucerase alfa has been developed and approved as an enzyme replacement therapy for Type 1 Gaucher disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Drug-related Adverse Events (AEs), Infusion-related AEs, and Serious AEs (SAEs)","timeFrame":"From the day of first infusion (Week 53) up to 30 days after last infusion (approximately 107 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Velaglucerase Alfa (VPRIVÂ®)","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27241455"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":5},"commonTop":["Headache","Abdominal pain upper","Gastroenteritis","Hordeolum","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
