Although there are many medications that are effective against migraines, none of these medications cure 100% of migraines. Another problem with migraines is that although many times they get better after intravenous (IV) treatment in the emergency room (ER), about 1/3 of the time migraines recur the next day. The purpose of this research project is to see if adding a medication called dexamethasone to standard ER therapy will help patients get better quicker and stay pain-free more often than if they receive placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Persistent Headache Pain Free at 24 Hours","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dexamethasone","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":19,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":106},"commonTop":["Drowsiness","Other","Acute Medication Reactoin","Dizziness"]}}
