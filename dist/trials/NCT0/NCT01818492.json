The new drug can be administered as the first-line therapy, to patients not previously treated with the current standard of care, or can be given to patients who have either failed or were unable to tolerate the current standard of care. Administration will be on top of a glucocorticosteroid, which is usually part of the current recommended treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR) Second Line","timeFrame":"End of Treatment (3 days after the last infusion of emapalumab in study NI-0501-04, occurring between 4 and 8 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NI-0501","deltaMin":63,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.0134"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["United States","Germany","Italy","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38662147","32374962"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02069899"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":45},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Hypertension","Condition aggravated","Diarrhoea","Rash"]}}
