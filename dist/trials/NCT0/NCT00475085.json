It is not yet known which combination of antiemetic drugs is more effective in preventing nausea caused by chemotherapy.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing different combinations of granisetron, dexamethasone, prochlorperazine, aprepitant, and palonosetron to see how well they work in preventing nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Home Record: Severity of Delayed Nausea","timeFrame":"average of day 1 afternoon, evening and night, and all of days 2 and 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm II","deltaMin":1.88,"sd":1.27},{"arm":"Arm III","deltaMin":1.65,"sd":1.15},{"arm":"Arm I","deltaMin":1.87,"sd":1.2},{"arm":"Arm IV","deltaMin":1.68,"sd":1.15}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.718"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.010"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.557"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22915657"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6},"commonTop":["Gastrointestinal","Chest Pain","Pulmonary"]}}
