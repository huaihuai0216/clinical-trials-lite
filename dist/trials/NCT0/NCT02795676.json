Patients who had been treated for approximately 1 year with agalsidase beta and who had been on a stable dose of that product for at least 6 months were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either switch to PRX-102 or to continue treatment with agalsidase beta. Both treatments were delivered by intravenous infusions every two weeks, at a dosage of 1 mg/kg.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Change (Slope) in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)","timeFrame":"24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PRX-102 (Pegunigalsidase Alfa)","deltaMin":-2.514,"sd":null},{"arm":"Agalsidase Beta","deltaMin":-2.155,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Czechia","Finland","France","Hungary","Italy","Netherlands","Norway","Slovenia","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39847314","37940383"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":52},"commonTop":["Headache","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Fatigue","Back pain"]}}
