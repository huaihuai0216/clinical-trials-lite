Patients will be treated with three intralymphatic injections; 1000 SQ-U x3 with 4-5 weeks interval, or placebo with 4-5 weeks interval. The patients receiving treatment will be given a fourth injection one year after the initial injections. The study is conducted in collaboration between Professor Lars Olof Cardell (ENT), prof Gunilla Hedlin (Pediatrics) and prof Marianne van Hage (Immunology)\".","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Symptoms Score After Nasal Allergen Challenge","timeFrame":"At inclusion (pre-treatment), 12 months after inclusion (after first pollen season) and for the active treated patients 24 months after inclusion (after the second pollen season).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Treatment","deltaMin":-4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26706294","24035151","23374268","22464647","26817454"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":["Redness","Itchyness","Swollen locally around injection site","Pain","Sneezing"]}}
