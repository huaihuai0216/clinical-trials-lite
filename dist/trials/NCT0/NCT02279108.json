A radioactive material requires the presence of a nuclear medicine department and the approval of health authorities. In many centers, this technique is not available. The use of blue is easier to implement technique. However, allergic reactions and prolonged breast tattoo led many teams to stop the practice.\n\nSo in common practice, many center use a single method. However, with a single detection, the risk of false negatives and the identification failure rate increased to a significant extent and the number of sentinel lymph node detected and removed is not enough.\n\nUnder these conditions, find another method of detection seems crucial. According to the literature, the fluorescence method (ICG) is a technique that seems safe and reliable.\n\nThe investigators therefore propose a prospective, randomized study to investigate the interest of fluorescence associated with the isotopic method.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Less Than Two Lymph Nodes Detected","timeFrame":"peroperative","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double Detection Indocyanine + Isotope","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Isotope Detection Alone","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["lymphocele","hematoma"]}}
