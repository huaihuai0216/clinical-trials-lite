The primary hypothesis is that the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) of bezlotoxumab after treatment of pediatric participants with bezlotoxumab is similar when compared to the AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab after treatment of adults with bezlotoxumab.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve of Bezlotoxumab From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-inf)","timeFrame":"Day 1 (2 hours postdose), Days 10, 29, 57, and 85","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bezlotoxumab: Cohort 1 (12 to <18 Years Age)","deltaMin":56100,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bezlotoxumab: Cohort 2 (1 to <12years of Age)","deltaMin":43200,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":75,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Colombia","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Malaysia","Mexico","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Romania","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37389891"],"seeAlso":["https://merckclinicaltrials.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":57,"n":107},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Vomiting","Headache","Abdominal pain","Anaemia"]}}
