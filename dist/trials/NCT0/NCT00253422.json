Hormone therapy using fulvestrant, anastrozole, or exemestane may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells or by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known whether giving fulvestrant together with anastrozole is more effective than giving fulvestrant together with a placebo or exemestane alone in treating breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fulvestrant and anastrozole to see how well they work compared to fulvestrant and a placebo or exemestane alone in treating postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"Assessed up to 190 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Faslodex + Placebo","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Faslodex + Arimidex","deltaMin":4.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Exemestane","deltaMin":3.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.76"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"1.00"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23902874","27269946"],"seeAlso":["https://www.icr.ac.uk/research-and-discoveries/centres-and-strategic-collaborations/clinical-trials-and-statistics-unit-icr-ctsu/detail/sofea"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":225},"commonTop":["Lethargy","Arthralgia","Vomiting","Hot Flush","Insomnia"]}}
