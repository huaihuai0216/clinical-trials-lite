Intraoperative anesthetic and postoperative pain management will be standardized. Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or gabapentin preoperatively, and continued postoperatively until discharge. Intraoperative anesthetic and other postoperative pain management strategies will be standardized. Postoperative delirium will be measured using structured interviews. Cognitive function will be measured using a battery of neurocognitive tests pre- and post-operatively. Using an intention to treat strategy, we, the researchers at UCSF, will compare the incidence of postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction, the amount of postoperative pain, and narcotic requirements between the two groups. The primary outcome will be postoperative delirium. Secondary outcomes will be postoperative pain and opioids use, and length of hospital stay, and cognitive dysfunction.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Postoperative Delirium by Study Group","timeFrame":"postoperative days 1, 2 and 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gabapentin","deltaMin":84,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":72,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28727581","16914695"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":350},"commonTop":["Oxygen Desaturation","Sedation","Syncope","Dizziness","Ileus"]}}
