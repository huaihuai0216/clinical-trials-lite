Phase 1 is designed to allow for a subject to be converted from the current anti-psychotic treatment to oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy (oral conversion phase from 4 to 6 weeks). During Phase 2 the subject will be stabilized on oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy. Once the subject is stabilized in Phase 2 (oral stabilization phase from minimum 8 weeks to maximum 28 weeks), they are eligible to be randomized into the double-blind IM depot maintenance phase, Phase 3. During Phase 3, the subject will be assessed for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and impending relapse for up to 38 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Meeting Exacerbation of Psychotic Symptoms/Impending Relapse Criteria by the End of Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aripiprazole Depot 300 or 400 mg - Depot Maintenance Phase","deltaMin":7.12,"sd":1.62},{"arm":"Aripiprazole 10-30 mg Orally - Depot Maintenance Phase","deltaMin":7.76,"sd":1.72},{"arm":"Aripiprazole Depot 25 or 50 mg - Depot Maintenance Phase","deltaMin":21.8,"sd":3.97}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.7871"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":98,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Chile","Croatia","Estonia","France","Hungary","Italy","Poland","Puerto Rico","South Africa","South Korea","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25711509","24925984"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":709},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Akathisia","Headache","Anxiety","Weight increased"]}}
