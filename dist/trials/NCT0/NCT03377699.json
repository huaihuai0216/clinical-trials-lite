In this study the medicine insulin degludec is compared to another medicine called insulin detemir. Participants will either get insulin degludec or insulin detemir and take it together with a medicine called insulin aspart - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Participants will get pre-filled insulin pens. Participants will need to take blood sugar measurements several times a day. The study will last between 10 and 25 months depending on whether participants are already pregnant when they join the study. The number of visits and the tests ( for example blood and urine samples and ultrasound scans) the participants will have also depends on whether they are pregnant at study start.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Last Planned Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) Prior to Delivery","timeFrame":"From GW 16 to GW 36","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IDeg","deltaMin":6.3,"sd":0.7},{"arm":"IDet","deltaMin":6.26,"sd":0.73}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3881"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":71,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Denmark","Greece","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Russia","Serbia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36623517"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":110},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Anaemia","Urinary tract infection","Headache","Polyhydramnios"]}}
