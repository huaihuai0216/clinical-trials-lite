In patients who develop AF during hospitalization after cardiac surgery, the hypothesis is that a strategy of rhythm control will reduce days in hospital within 60 days of the occurrence of AF compared to a strategy of rate control.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Number of Days in Hospital","timeFrame":"Within 60 days of randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rate Control","deltaMin":5.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Rhythm Control","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.76"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29043263","27043047"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ctsurgerynet.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":71,"n":262},"commonTop":["Major infection","Cardiac Arrhythmias","Renal events","Pleural effusion","Bleeding"]}}
