At the present time, it is not known whether intravitreal steroid or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are beneficial in preventing vision loss after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment. It is possible that one or both of the types of injections will prevent vision loss after PRP treatment. However, it is not known whether the benefits of the injections will outweigh the risks. It is possible that because of side effects, the injections may not be as good as laser alone in treating the diabetic retinopathy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Visual Acuity Letter Score From Baseline to 14 Weeks","timeFrame":"baseline to 14 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sham Injection","deltaMin":-4,"sd":14},{"arm":"0.5mg Ranibizumab","deltaMin":1,"sd":11},{"arm":"4-mg Triamcinolone Acetonided","deltaMin":2,"sd":11}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":56,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22136692","22332211","22965591","23807371","23792486","25719991","26035510","21459214","20427088","22999634","26802783","25439614","21571677","20008710"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":133},"commonTop":["Vision Blurred","Vitreous haemorrhage","Eye pain","Myodesopsia","Conjunctival haemorrhage"]}}
