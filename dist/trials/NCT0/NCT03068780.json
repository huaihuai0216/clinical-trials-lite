In most cases, onset of EB is at birth or shortly after. All participants affected by any type of EB share the main characteristic of repeatedly developing painful wounds that take days to months to heal. Current treatment of EB is primarily preventative and supportive including protection from mechanical forces by avoiding rubbing, early treatment of wounds to prevent infections, and protection of the wound with adequate non-adhesive dressings to enable healing.\n\nThe active pharmaceutical ingredient in Oleogel-S10 is a refined birch bark extract, quantified to 72 to 88% betulin.\n\nThis clinical study of Oleogel-S10 in patients with inherited EB has been carried out to investigate whether Oleogel-S10 is effective for treatment of EB wounds and safe for long-term use.\n\nOleogel-S10 was compared to a control gel. The control gel matched Oleogel-S10 in terms of texture and visual appearance to allow for double-blinding. The packaging for Oleogel-S10 gel and the control gel were identical. The participant received either Oleogel-S10 or control gel for a double-blind study phase of 90 days. The probability that the participant received Oleogel-S10 was 50%, which means that they had a 1 in 2 chance of receiving Oleogel-S10. However, in the follow-up phase of the study all participants were treated with Oleogel-S10 for a period of 24 months.\n\nThis clinical study was performed at 49 study sites in 26 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong \\[China\\], Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and the United States); 223 participants participated in total.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients With First Complete Closure of the EB Target Wound Within 45 Days of Treatment","timeFrame":"45±7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oleogel-S10","deltaMin":45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Gel","deltaMin":33,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.013"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":51,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Chile","Colombia","Czechia","Denmark","France","Georgia","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","Spain","Switzerland","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":109},"commonTop":["Wound complication","Anaemia","Pyrexia","Wound infection","Wound infection staphylococcal"]}}
