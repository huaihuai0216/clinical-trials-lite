Subjects will receive each study treatment on separate visits and undergo a treadmill exercise challenge test for up to 10 minutes so that the effect of study treatment on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maximum Percentage Fall From Post-dose, Pre-exercise Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV₁) Observed up to 60 Minutes Post-exercise Challenge","timeFrame":"Up to 60 minutes post exercise challenge","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Intervention A - BDA MDI 160/180 - All Subjects","deltaMin":5.45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Intervention B - Placebo MDI - All Subjects","deltaMin":18.97,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34699967"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Anxiety","Dyspnoea"]}}
