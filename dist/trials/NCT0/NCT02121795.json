After Week 96, all participants will continue on blinded study drug treatment and attend visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments are unblinded. All participants will return for an unblinding visit and will be given the option to receive open-label F/TAF and attend visits every 12 weeks until F/TAF is commercially available, or the sponsor terminates the F/TAF clinical development program.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL at Week 48 as Defined by the FDA Snapshot Analysis","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"F/TAF + 3rd Agent","deltaMin":94.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"FTC/TDF + 3rd Agent","deltaMin":93,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.5"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Italy","Puerto Rico","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27036991"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":333},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Back pain","Cough"]}}
