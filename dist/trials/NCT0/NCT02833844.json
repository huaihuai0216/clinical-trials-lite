The first part of the study will be double-blinded and will last for 24 weeks. During this time, participants will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either evolocumab once monthly (QM) or placebo QM. The second part of the study is a 24-week open label extension period. During this time all participants will receive evolocumab QM.\n\nThe clinical hypothesis is that subcutaneous evolocumab QM will be well tolerated and will result in greater reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), defined as percent change from baseline at Week 24, compared with placebo QM in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive participants with hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in LDL-C at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double-Blind Placebo","deltaMin":1.68,"sd":2.03},{"arm":"Double-Blind Evolocumab","deltaMin":-55.23,"sd":1.52}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","France","Greece","Italy","Poland","Portugal","Romania","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32234462","31841795","35025817","33078867"],"seeAlso":["http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":157},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Back pain","Influenza like illness","Arthralgia"]}}
