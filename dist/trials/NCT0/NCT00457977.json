People with chronic illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), have a greater risk of developing pneumonia and meningitis as a result of pneumococcal disease. This study will compare the immune response to two types of pneumococcal vaccines in adults with COPD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Serotype Opsonization Titers","timeFrame":"Measured at Baseline, Months 1, 12, and 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pneumovax (PPSV23)","deltaMin":10.85,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevnar (PCV7)","deltaMin":12.63,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":18,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22652582","19556517"],"seeAlso":["http://www.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":90},"commonTop":["COPD","Acute Respiratory Infection","Other - Respiratory","Rheumatism","Pain"]}}
