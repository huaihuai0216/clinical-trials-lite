The study investigators aim to compare two different infusion rates of oxytocin to assess the optimal infusion regimen for reducing blood loss in women undergoing elective Cesarean delivery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Estimated Blood Loss","timeFrame":"immediately at end of surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oxytocin Infusion 1","deltaMin":512,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oxytocin Infusion 2","deltaMin":634,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":[]}}
