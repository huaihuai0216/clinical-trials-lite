Fenofibrate is a treatment that lowers fat in blood. It is prescribed in patients with high levels of triglycerides (TG). The drug has been marketed in more than 80 countries since 1975. Simvastatin is also used for the treatment of patients with a high level of cholesterol. These have also been marketed worldwide for more than 20 years. It is important to treat high levels of fats in the blood because it has been shown that even mildly elevated level of lipids in the blood can lead to diseases of the blood vessels. It has been shown in several studies and in clinical practice that the combination of fenofibrate plus simvastatin can lead to improved effects on blood fats, compared to treatment with simvastatin or fenofibrate alone. The main objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of the two fixed-combinations (FC) -fenofibrate/simvastatin 145/20 mg tablet and fenofibrate/simvastatin 145/40 mg tablet in reducing TG and increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) versus simvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg, and in reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) versus fenofibrate 145 mg.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Change of TG (Triglyceride)","timeFrame":"from baseline to 12 weeks of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fenofibrate/Simvastatin 145/20 mg","deltaMin":-30.6,"sd":25.8},{"arm":"Simvastatin 20 mg","deltaMin":10.7,"sd":48.8},{"arm":"Fenofibrate/Simvastatin 145/40 mg","deltaMin":-27.3,"sd":35.9},{"arm":"Simvastatin 40 mg","deltaMin":-2.9,"sd":34.3},{"arm":"Fenofibrate 145 mg","deltaMin":-21.6,"sd":34.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":69,"countries":["Argentina","Czechia","Germany","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":111},"commonTop":["DIARRHOEA","NASOPHARYNGITIS","BLOOD CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE INCREASED","GASTROENTERITIS","DYSPEPSIA"]}}
