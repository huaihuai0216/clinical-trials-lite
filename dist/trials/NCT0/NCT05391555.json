Previous investigation demonstrated that loss of PUAL was a sensitive, discriminative indicator of opioid toxicity and respiratory depression among subjects aged 20-40 years old. Population data indicate that pupil size and PUAL decline slightly with age. The investigators will explore whether PUAL proves to be a sensitive indicator of opioid exposure and respiratory depression in this older group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Area Under the Time Concentration Curve (AUROC )","timeFrame":"Baseline, and every 2.5 minutes during 10-minute infusion and 25-minute recovery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Remifentanil Infusion and Recovery","deltaMin":0.97,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33651243","34474355","29608463"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
