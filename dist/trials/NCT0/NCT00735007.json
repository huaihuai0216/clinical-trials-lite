The RebiSmart™ device is a stand-alone hand-held device with internal power supply. It is used for subcutaneous (under the skin) injections with single-use sterile disposable needles. The device will be kept in a storage box and placed in the refrigerator after each use.\n\nThe key features of the RebiSmart™ are as follows:\n\n* Battery powered electromechanical automatic injector;\n* Automatic needle attachment and detachment;\n* Hidden needle before and after injection;\n* Injection can only be initiated by pressing the injection button when in contact with the skin;\n* Automatic needle insertion and injection of the preset dose into the subcutaneous (under the skin) tissue;\n* Adjustable injection comfort parameters: Injection depth, needle insertion speed, medication injection speed and time that the needle remains in the skin ;\n* Cartridges with 3 doses of Rebif® New Formulation; and\n* Several other electronic functions including history (date and time) of cartridge changes and injections.\n\nThe Study Drug - Rebif® New Formulation (RNF) Rebif® is a medicine that is part of a family of proteins called interferon beta-1a (IFN-β-1a) molecules that play an important role in the immune system and help limit the damage that occurs with multiple sclerosis (MS). The interferon in Rebif® is like your body's own natural human interferon, but is made outside the body by a process called \"recombinant DNA technology\". Merck Serono International S.A. (the maker of Rebif®) has recently updated the method to make Rebif®, and it is referred to as Rebif® New Formulation (RNF).\n\nFor the purpose of this study, the form of Rebif® New Formulation (RNF) will differ slightly from the one you currently receive. RNF will be supplied in pre-filled cartridges containing three doses of 44mcg / 0.5 ml IFN-β-1a. This is the amount required for you to administer during the course of one full week of treatment. The dosage of RNF 44mcg is injected under the skin three times per week. The RebiSmart™ device will be provided for the administration of RNF. RNF should be administered, if possible, at the same time (preferably in the late afternoon or evening) on the same three days (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with at least 48 hours break between each administration. You will be asked to record the time and date of each injection in the diary cards provided. You will be taught how to properly use the device to inject the medication. You will also be reminded to rotate injection sites and advised on the importance of avoiding already inflamed areas for future injections.\n\nThe goals of this research trial are:\n\n* To evaluate if the electronic device can be used (if it is suitable) by MS patients performing self-injections of Rebif® New Formulation.\n* To determine MS patients overall satisfaction of the new RebiSmart™ device by determining their ease in using it, how often side effects happen (flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions and any other overall injection issues) that they may experience while on the trial. This will be done by completion of the Patient User Trial Questionnaire and the Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Concern Questionnaire (MSTCQ).\n* To evaluate specific features of the RebiSmart™ device from the answers MS patients provide in the User Trial Questionnaire. The MS patient and the person who will trains them on the proper use of the device will complete this questionnaire.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Number of Subjects Rating the Suitability of RebiSmart at the End of 12-week Treatment Period for Self-injecting Rebif® New Formulation (RNF).","timeFrame":"End of 12 week treatment period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RebiSmart for Self-injection","deltaMin":73,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Italy","Spain","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20433746"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":106},"commonTop":["Infuenza like illness","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Influenza"]}}
