Participants also received a Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib)-MCC vaccination at 12 months of age. It was hypothesized that the SPR to MCC at 1 month post-dose 2 of either tetanus toxoid conjugated Meningo C (MCC-TT) or CRM197 conjugated Meningo C (MCC-CRM) vaccines would be acceptable when administered concomitantly with V419.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Anti-Meningococcal Serogroup C (Anti-MCC) Antibody (Ab) Titre ≥1:8 Dil One Month After MCC-TT or MCC-CRM (Part 1)","timeFrame":"Month 5 (1 month after MCC-TT/MCC-CRM Dose 2)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V419 and MCC-TT","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"V419 and MCC-CRM","deltaMin":99.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"46 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":142},"commonTop":["Irritability","Crying","Somnolence","Injection site erythema","Injection site pain"]}}
