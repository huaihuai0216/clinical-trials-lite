Participants will either get insulin glargine and semaglutide or insulin glargine and insulin aspart - which treatment the participant get is decided by chance. Insulin glargine is taken once a day and semaglutide once a week. Insulin aspart is taken three times per day before a meal. All three medicines come in pre-filled pens for injection under the skin. The study will last for about 71 weeks. If participant's blood sugar gets under or over certain values participant will only participate in 14 weeks. The study doctor will inform the participant about this. The participant will have 15 clinic visits and 22 phone calls with the study doctor.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":1},{"arm":"Insulin Aspart","deltaMin":-1.2,"sd":1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":210,"countries":["Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","Germany","Greece","Hungary","India","Latvia","Lithuania","North Macedonia","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Serbia","Slovakia","Slovenia","South Africa","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35546450"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":874},"commonTop":["Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Vomiting"]}}
