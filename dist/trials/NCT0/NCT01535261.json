Spectral domain high-definition optical coherence tomography (OCT) images was analyzed to gain insights into predictive factors for disease progression and the possibility of reduced monitoring was assessed in Year 2. The results of this open-label study provided long-term safety and efficacy data to further guide recommendations on the use of ranibizumab in this indication.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 Compared to Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline to month 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ranibizumab Arm","deltaMin":12.3,"sd":16.72}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["Australia","Austria","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","Greece","Hungary","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34934034","31047340"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":64,"n":357},"commonTop":["Intraocular pressure increased (Study eye)","Hypertension","Nasopharyngitis","Ocular hypertension (Study eye)","Eye pain (Study eye)"]}}
