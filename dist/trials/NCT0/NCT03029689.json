This study provides a unique opportunity to understand the benefits of ART with high intestinal penetration on the gut microbiome. It is thus a key study to understand the bidirectional interactions between the microbiome and the host in people living with HIV/AIDS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Bacterial Gene Richness (Observed Unique Genes).
