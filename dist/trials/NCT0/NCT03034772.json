This will be a larger study where subjects are randomly assigned to receive the glaucoma drops or a placebo (artificial tears) in order to confirm whether this previous finding is valid. Subjects will continue to receive the normally scheduled anti-VEGF injections at regular intervals as done prior to enrollment. The only addition to the regimen will be the daily use of eye drops (dorzolamide-timolol or artificial tears) twice daily for the duration of the study. At the end of the study, the swelling in the retina will be compared to the amount before starting the drops to see if there is any difference between the group using dorzolamide-timolol versus artificial tears.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Mean Central Subfield Thickness (CST)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 18 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dorzolamide-timolol","deltaMin":-36.6,"sd":54},{"arm":"Artificial Tears","deltaMin":1.7,"sd":52.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.04"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26914218","32239190"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["Eyelid edema"]}}
