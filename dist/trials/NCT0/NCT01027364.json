The secondary objectives of the study were: to evaluate and assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of rFIXFc and rFIX (BeneFIX®) at baseline in the Sequential PK subgroup as well as rFIXFc at Week 26 (±1 week); to evaluate participants' response to treatment; to evaluate rFIXFc consumption.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities","timeFrame":"up to 52 weeks ± 1 week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Weekly Prophylaxis","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Individualized Interval Prophylaxis","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 3: Episodic (On Demand)","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":51,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","France","Germany","Hong Kong","India","Italy","Japan","Poland","Russia","South Africa","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24304002","36848635"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":63},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Influenza","Arthralgia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache"]}}
