The study team will work closely with schools and the Utah public health system to implement and test a shovel-ready and scalable health information technology approach that delivers automated text messages (TM) to students' parents around COVID-19 testing. In addition, some parents will receive a health navigator (HN) follow-up to ensure that tests are completed. Families will be offered the recently FDA-approved in-home serial testing approach if accessing in-person testing is a challenge. While this project is focused on COVID-19 testing, in the case that the COVID-19 vaccination becomes more relevant or is the priority of the school, the study team is able to tailor the intervention to focus on the vaccine as well. The outcomes in this study utilized parent/student reported data. Staff data were also collected but will not be reflected in primary outcome analyses.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Testing Uptake- The Number of Valid Responses That Confirmed COVID-19 Testing Was Completed by Households","timeFrame":"Monthly (up to 16-months post-baseline)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":0.1603,"sd":0.3669},{"arm":"Text Messaging (TM)","deltaMin":0.2552,"sd":0.4361},{"arm":"Text Messaging Plus Health Navigation","deltaMin":0.2484,"sd":0.4322}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":2367},"commonTop":[]}}
