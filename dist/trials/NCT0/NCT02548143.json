Administration of LR769 will be performed just prior to surgery/procedure and will be repeated during and after the surgery/procedure to achieve and maintain adequate hemostasis as determined by the investigator's judgment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Surgical or Other Invasive Procedures Defined as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\" Response to LR769 Treatment as Assessed by the Investigator, Based on the Totality of the Assessments Performed on the Patient","timeFrame":"48 (±4) hours after the last administration of LR769","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Major Surgery (LR769 Initial Dose 200 μg/kg; Then 75 μg/kg)","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Minor Surgery (LR769 Initial Dose 75 μg/kg; Then 75 μg/kg)","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Mexico","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":6},"commonTop":["Procedural Pain","Wound Secretion","Anaemia","Anaemia Postoperative","Post Procedural Haemorrhage"]}}
