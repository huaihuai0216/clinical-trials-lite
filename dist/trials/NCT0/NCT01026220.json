Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Second-event-free Survival","timeFrame":"At 4 years from enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1","deltaMin":0.91,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":177,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Israel","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39969278","37505794"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":165},"commonTop":["Febrile neutropenia","Mucositis oral","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Fever","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
