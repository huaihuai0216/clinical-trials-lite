Researchers want to learn which method helps people to recover more completely and more quickly after surgery.\n\nThe 2 kinds of pain control are intravenous (IV) pain management and epidural pain management.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postoperative Pain Experience","timeFrame":"First 48 hours after surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TEA (Thoracic Epidural Analgesia)","deltaMin":78.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"IV-PCA (Intravenous Patient-controlled Analgesia)","deltaMin":105.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28807031","28746153"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":106},"commonTop":[]}}
