Patients were randomized to receive either vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Study treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients in the dacarbazine group be allowed to cross over to receive vemurafenib, and the protocol was amended accordingly on January 14, 2011, as both overall survival and progression-free survival endpoints had met the prespecified criteria for statistical significance in favor of vemurafenib.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From randomization (initiated January 2010) to December 30 2010.
