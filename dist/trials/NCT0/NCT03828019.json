Vision-threatening cases require long-term therapy with oral corticosteroids and immunosuppression. Based upon preliminary data, adalimumab, a fully-human, anti-tumor necrosis(TNF)-Î± monoclonal antibody, now US FDA-approved for uveitis treatment, may be a superior corticosteroid-sparing agent than conventional immunosuppressive drugs. The ADVISE Trial is multicenter randomized, parallel-treatment, comparative effectiveness trial comparing adalimumab to conventional (small molecule) immunosuppression for corticosteroid spring in the treatment of non-infectious, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitides.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Corticosteroid-sparing Treatment Success Within the First 6 Months After Randomization","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Adalimumab (ADA)","deltaMin":0.69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Conventional Immunosuppression (CON)","deltaMin":0.54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.029"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Australia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37172782"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":113},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Myalgia","Insomnia","Headache","Depression/anxiety"]}}
