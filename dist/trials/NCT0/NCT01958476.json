One hundred eighty four full-term infants with a diagnosis of NAS requiring medications will be studied. Infants will be randomized to receive either morphine or methadone. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will do better and require fewer days in the hospital compared to methadone treated infants.\n\n2\\. SPECIFIC Aim II: To evaluate the effects of NAS treatment on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Infants will be evaluated with development testing at 18 months of age. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is also hypothesized that neurobehavioral abnormalities identified at two weeks of age will correlate with neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 months.\n\n3: SPECIFIC Aim III: To determine if common genetic variations in the genes involving narcotic action contribute to the severity of NAS. A DNA sample will be obtained from all infants and analyzed for differences in 3 key genes. This will then be correlated with short-term and long-term outcomes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Length of Hospital Stay (LOS)","timeFrame":"Participants will be monitored during their entire hospitalization, expected mean 22 days.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methadone","deltaMin":21.8,"sd":15},{"arm":"Neonatal Morphine Solution","deltaMin":23.2,"sd":8.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23632726","16355103","16202968","15530129","19344048","20927730","21142534","34231914","31987653","29913015"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":58},"commonTop":["Excessive sleepiness/somnolence","Bradychardia","Hypothermia","Stridor/desaturation/shalllow breathing","Apnea and shallow breathing episodes"]}}
