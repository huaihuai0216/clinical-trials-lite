Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether it is more effective to give combination chemotherapy before or after treatment with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"pCR Within the Breast, Defined as no Evidence of Invasive Tumor Remaining in the Breast at Surgery Following Completion of Chemotherapy","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FEC-75 Then Paclitaxel/Trastuzumab","deltaMin":56.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paclitaxel/Trastuzumab Then Trastuzumab/FEC-75","deltaMin":54.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".7"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":32,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":115,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30193295","28453704","24239210"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":138},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Alopecia","Diarrhea"]}}
