The CFQ-R is a validated, patient-reported outcome tool used to measure health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF.\n\nThe study consisted of a 24-week randomized phase, and a 24-week open-label phase. Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were conducted for the 24-week randomized phase only. Safety data were collected for both the randomized and open-label phases.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"AUCave of Relative Change in FEV1 % Predicted From Baseline to Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AZLI","deltaMin":0.16,"sd":1.5},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.75,"sd":1.43}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.663"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":48},"commonTop":["Cough","Sputum increased","Pyrexia","Dyspnoea","Nasal congestion"]}}
