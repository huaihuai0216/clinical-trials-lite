The drug will be administered into the abdomen during a bariatric bypass surgery. After surgery, patients who received Ropivacaine will be compared to those without Ropivacaine to determine its effect on reducing pain, recovery of lung function, ability to walk, and quality of life during recovery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"0-1 h Postoperative Pain Level","timeFrame":"0-1 hours post operatively","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intraperitoneal Normal Saline","deltaMin":3.9762,"sd":2.5191},{"arm":"Intraperitoneal Ropivacaine","deltaMin":4.3149,"sd":2.1074}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34759045","25113556"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":46},"commonTop":[]}}
