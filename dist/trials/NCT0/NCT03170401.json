The investigators will also collect data on important clinical outcomes, including infectious complications, duration of mechanical ventilation and other measures of recovery from critical illness.\n\nHypothesis: That early supplemental protein will increase serum concentrations of transthyretin at three weeks after the onset of illness or injury. Secondarily, the investigators will test whether supplementation, reduces infectious complications and increases ventilator-free days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Serum Concentrations of Transthyretin at 3 Weeks After Injury.","timeFrame":"3 weeks after admission for injury","effectByArm":[{"arm":"no Protein Supplementation","deltaMin":18.1,"sd":8},{"arm":"Protein Supplementation","deltaMin":18.9,"sd":8.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":256},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Abdominal distention","Emesis"]}}
