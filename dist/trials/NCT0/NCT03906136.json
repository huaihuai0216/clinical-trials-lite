The aim of the study was to demonstrate that the efficacy of a T2T approach (with secukinumab as a first-line biologic) was superior to a SOC approach in terms of achieving strong clinical efficacy in patients with active axSpA who were na√Øve to biological therapy and who had an inadequate response to prior non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Achieving an ASAS40 Response at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treat-to-Target (T2T)","deltaMin":40.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard-of-care (SOC)","deltaMin":49.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.119"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":47,"countries":["France","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32998926"],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/patientsummary/patientsummaries?patientSummaryId=1836"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":190},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Headache","Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
