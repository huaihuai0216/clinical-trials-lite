Participants are randomized to receive one of three doses of PEG-Intron (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg) or Interferon Alfa-2B for 48 weeks. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PEG-Intron (compared to Interferon Alfa-2B) with respect to response based on loss of detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) and normalization of alanine transaminase (ALT) level after 24 weeks of therapy and at 24 weeks of follow-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Achieving Responder Status at 24 Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"Up to 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PEG-Intron, 0.5 mg/kg","deltaMin":80,"sd":null},{"arm":"PEG-Intron, 1.0 mg/kg","deltaMin":87,"sd":null},{"arm":"PEG-Intron, 1.5 mg/kg","deltaMin":90,"sd":null},{"arm":"Interferon Alfa-2b","deltaMin":59,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.078"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.005"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":37,"n":315},"commonTop":["Headache","Fatigue","Myalgia","Chills","Pyrexia"]}}
