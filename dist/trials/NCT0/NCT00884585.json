The study consists of a double-masked phase, and open-labeled phase, and an open-labeled maintenance phase. For the first 3 months of the study, patients will receive either masked Cyclosporine 0.010% eye drops or vehicle four times daily; for the next 6 months, patients may receive open-labeled Cyclosporine 0.010% eye drops four times daily. At month 9, patients who are in remission, will be re-randomized to receive either open-labeled Cyclosporine 0.010% eye drops four times daily or twice daily.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Treatment Responders","timeFrame":"Baseline, Month 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Solution (COS) Followed by COS","deltaMin":21.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":17.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","India","Israel","Italy","New Zealand","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":171},"commonTop":["Allergic Keratitis","Blepharitis","Punctate Keratitis"]}}
