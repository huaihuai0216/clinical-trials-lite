The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V116 when administered concomitantly with Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) compared with V116 administered sequentially with QIV. The primary hypotheses state that immune responses to V116 and to QIV are non-inferior when administered concomitantly as compared with sequential administration as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) for V116 and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) for QIV, at 30 days postvaccination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Solicited Injection-site Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 5 days post-vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Concomitant Group (V116 + QIV Followed by Placebo)","deltaMin":317,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sequential Group (Placebo + QIV Followed by V116)","deltaMin":314,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":56,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26087&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":534},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Fatigue","Headache","Myalgia","Injection site swelling"]}}
