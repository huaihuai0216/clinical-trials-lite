CES may lessen symptoms in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. It is not yet known whether CES is more effective than sham therapy in reducing symptoms caused by chemotherapy in women with breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying mild electrical stimulation to see how well it works compared with sham therapy in reducing symptoms caused by chemotherapy in women with stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Effects of CES as Compared to Sham CES on Symptoms of Depression, Anxiety, Fatigue, Pain and Sleep Disturbances in Women Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Early-stage Breast Cancer","timeFrame":"Up to 2 weeks afer completion of study treatment, for up to 8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Cranial Microcurrent Electrical Stimulation [CES])","deltaMin":4.04,"sd":0.419},{"arm":"Arm II (Sham CES)","deltaMin":4.529,"sd":0.431}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26435889"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":77},"commonTop":[]}}
