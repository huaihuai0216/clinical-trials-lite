If a low dose of ICS is ineffective at controlling symptoms, the addition of a second controller medication is recommended. This study will examine the effectiveness of the medication tiotropium bromide combined with a low dose of ICS at maintaining asthma control in people with moderately severe asthma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change Between Week 14 and Week 0 in the Morning (AM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)","timeFrame":"AM PEF was measured daily during each of the three 14-week treatment periods.
