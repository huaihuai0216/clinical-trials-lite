The study will be divided into an initial 2 week phase and a second 2 week phase, with one of the 2 week phases consisting of active treatment with tolcapone, and the other 2 week phase consisting of inactive placebo treatment. There will be a one-week wash-out phase between the 2-week treatment phases. Participants will be randomized to receive either tolcapone or placebo during the first 2 week phase on a 1:1 basis. This blinding will be maintained by the IDS pharmacy at the University of Chicago.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)","timeFrame":"2 weeks (start of study to washout period OR two weeks following washout period)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tolcapone","deltaMin":-4.24,"sd":6.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":4.71}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["10986728","3493749","22138231","11144344","24177038","17855376","18635808","10025435","17196050","16848654","25119610","15190105","19417742","17063156","2392679","15381316","11925305","18037454","21521027","19699472","12538800","17467918","9881538","2684084","17909307","14399272","13638508"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["Mild Headache","Increased frequency in bowel movements","Blood in stool","Less frequent bowel movements","Fatigue"]}}
