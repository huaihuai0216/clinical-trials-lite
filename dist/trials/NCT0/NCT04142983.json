After obtaining informed consent and screening for eligibility including plasmapheresis donor eligibility, subjects will have other baseline assessments performed and if eligible, will receive the scheduled vaccinations, will be assessed for adverse events (AEs) and have plasma samples collected for antibody titers each month thereafter for 11 months, and then at 1 and 6 months after the last vaccination. As these subjects are participating in a standard donor plasmapheresis donor program, assessments for donor eligibility and routine plasmapheresis will be performed; however, only the data specifically required to meet the objectives of this study will be collected.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 18 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tdap Vaccine","deltaMin":71,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":100},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site bruising","Red blood cells urine positive","Urine leukocyte esterase positive","Injection site erythema"]}}
