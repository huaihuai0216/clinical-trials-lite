To establish the safety and efficacy of the use of bivalirudin (+ bail-out GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors) compared to the use of unfractionated heparin + GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing a primary angioplasty strategy.\n2. To establish the safety and efficacy of the slow rate release paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS™ stent compared to an otherwise identical uncoated bare metal EXPRESS2™ stent.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pharmacology Arm - Major Adverse Ischemic Cardiac Events and Major Bleeding Events","timeFrame":"30 Days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pharmacology Arm - Bivalirudin","deltaMin":166,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pharmacology Arm - Unfractionated Heparin","deltaMin":218,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28724652","28249084","27287251","27165710","26458411","26198286","25858976","25572507","25179260","24939928","24703369","24576541","24561145","24140664","24093847","24084625","23652600","23538158","23518872","23425539","23359554","23339809","23328566","23192919","23174632","22795245","22575312","22438429","21996385","21816305","21777884","21665265","21632496","21596321","21586693","21482968","21364152","21315224","21220730","20888162","20805433","20723849","19858413","19796737","19717185","19420364","18585496","18499566"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":397,"n":1800},"commonTop":["Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries Mild Bleeding","Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Minor Bleeding"]}}
