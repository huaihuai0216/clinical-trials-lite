Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, that can provide useful images of the functioning of the lung will be used as a new measure to determine change in function. The investigator anticipate these images will provide more specific information about lung disease than standard lung function tests in response to treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Ventilation Distribution as Measured by Ventilation Defect+Low Percent","timeFrame":"Week 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment","deltaMin":57.8,"sd":8.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":[]}}
