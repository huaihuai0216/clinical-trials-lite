Giving chemotherapy, such as thiotepa and cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving tacrolimus, methotrexate, and sirolimus after the transplant may stop this from happening. It is not yet known whether tacrolimus and methotrexate are more effective with or without sirolimus in preventing graft-versus-host disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Estimated Percentage of Participants With Event Free Survival","timeFrame":"at 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental","deltaMin":45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":22,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25862561","24497539"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":72},"commonTop":["White blood cell decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Platelet count decreased","Lymphocyte count decreased","Hypokalemia"]}}
