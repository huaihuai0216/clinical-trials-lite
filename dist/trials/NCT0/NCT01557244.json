Children will be aged 6 to 17 years old. This is done by finding out how well it works, what the body does to fesoterodine, what side effects are experienced and the safety of fesoterodine. It will be compared with the medicine oxybutynin, which is already available for treating the condition.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Bladder Capacity at Week 12: Active Comparator Phase/Efficacy Phase","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort 1, Active Comparator Phase: Fesoterodine 4 mg","deltaMin":58.12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 1, Active Comparator Phase: Fesoterodine 4 mg Then 8 mg","deltaMin":83.36,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 1, Active Comparator Phase: Oxybutynin","deltaMin":87.17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2, Efficacy Phase: Fesoterodine 2 mg","deltaMin":23.49,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2, Efficacy Phase: Fesoterodine 2 mg Then 4 mg","deltaMin":40.17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG002","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":84,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","India","Italy","Japan","Lithuania","Malaysia","Philippines","Poland","Russia","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36892754","36504158"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A0221047&StudyName=A%20Study%20To%20Find%20Out%20How%20Fesoterodine%20Works%20In%20Children%20Aged%206%20To%2017%20Years%20With%20Bladder%20Overactivity%20Caused%20By%20A%20Neurological%20Condi"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":42},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Dry mouth","Urinary tract infection","Headache","Constipation"]}}
