Based on the recent findings of encouraging results obtained with propranolol in a series of infants with severe Infantile Hemangioma (IH), propranolol is expected to be of significant benefit in the management of the condition. The present study has been designed to confirm efficacy of propranolol in severe IH by demonstrating superiority over placebo and to document the safety profile of propranolol in this indication.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Interim Analysis : Complete/Nearly Complete Resolution of the Target Infantile Hemangioma at Week 24 Compared to Baseline Based on the Intra-patient Blinded Centralized Independent Qualitative Assessments of Week 24 Photographs.","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Propranolol 1mg/kg/d 3 Months","deltaMin":9.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Propranolol 1 mg/kg/d 6 Months","deltaMin":37.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Propranolol 3 mg/kg/d 3 Months","deltaMin":7.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Propranolol 3 mg/kg/d 6 Months","deltaMin":62.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003 vs OG004","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":59,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Lithuania","Mexico","New Zealand","Peru","Poland","Romania","Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18550886","19706583","25693013"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":55},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Pyrexia","Teething","Upper respiratory tract infection","Bronchitis"]}}
