Patients will be randomized either to remain on darbepoetin alfa therapy as per local label, or to switch to monthly subcutaneous Mircera, at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms, depending on the weekly dose of darbepoetin alfa administered prior to the first dose of Mircera. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Hemoglobin (Hb) Concentration From Baseline to the Evaluation Period","timeFrame":"Baseline (measurements at Week -4, Week -2 and Day 1) and Evaluation Period (Months 8 and 9; measurements twice a month and at the final visit).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mircera","deltaMin":11.29,"sd":0.382},{"arm":"Darbepoetin Alfa","deltaMin":11.33,"sd":0.397}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36791280"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":115},"commonTop":["HYPERTENSION","RENAL IMPAIRMENT","NASOPHARYNGITIS","URINARY TRACT INFECTION","DIARRHOEA"]}}
