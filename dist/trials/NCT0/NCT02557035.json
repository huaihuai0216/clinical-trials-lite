The objective of the study is to demonstrate that infused IV palonosetron 0.25 mg is as effective as (non-inferior to) injected palonosetron IV 0.25 mg to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy in the 0-24 hours after administration of a single cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With Complete Response (CR) Defined as no Emesis, no Rescue Medication, in the Acute Phase","timeFrame":"0-24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"I.V.
