Given the spread of COVID-19 both locally and globally, is crucial to adapt accordingly in order to safely provide vulnerable cancer patient populations with optimal care while minimizing risk of exposure to COVID-19. In this study, the investigators will utilize remote monitoring of patients with cancer via weekly patient-reported outcome (PRO) collection through the Way to Health (W2H) smartphone application and step data through wearable Fitbit devices. Patients with incurable lung and gastrointestinal cancers will be recruited based on whether they receive their care in-clinic or remotely. They will respond to weekly phone-based symptom surveys and wear Fitbits that track step data. This data will be collated in a Palliative Care Assessment Dashboard (PROStep Dashboard) sent to clinicians prior to each oncology visit to help inform patient management. In this feasibility study, two arms of patients will be monitored with symptom surveys and Fitbits; the study will randomize these patients to either 1) receive text feedback or 2) receive no text feedback. A third arm of patients will be randomized to receive no feedback, symptom surveys, or Fitbit device. Clinicians for patients in each arm will receive the PROstep Dashboard. The study will determine feasibility of this monitoring approach, and compare patient adherence to symptom surveys and step data collection between the two intervention arms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patient Perceptions of Symptom Management - How Well do You Feel Your Oncology Team Understands Your Symptoms (e.g. Nausea, Vomiting, Weight Loss, Etc.)?","timeFrame":"These will be measured at 6 months after enrollment for each patient (or 3 months if the patient did not complete their 6 month survey)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":1},{"arm":"Arms B+C","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38758583","37816198","35551088"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":33},"commonTop":[]}}
