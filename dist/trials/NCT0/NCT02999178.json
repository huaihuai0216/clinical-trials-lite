There is currently no efficacious treatment available for PF-ILD. Based on its efficacy and safety in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), it is anticipated that Nintedanib will be a new treatment option for patients with PF-ILD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annual Rate of Decline in Forced Vital Capacity - Overall Population","timeFrame":"Baseline, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 52 weeks after first drug intake (planned post-baseline visits)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"150 mg Nintedanib","deltaMin":-80.82,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-187.78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":153,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Canada","Chile","China","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37751022","36894966","36642509","35927208","35392908","35241434","34564020","34475231","34210788","33726766","32217654","32145830","31566307","29018526"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":147,"n":332},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Bronchitis","Nasopharyngitis","Dyspnoea"]}}
