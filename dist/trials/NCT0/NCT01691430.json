The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of two oral cranberry capsules per day in the reduction of bacteriuria plus pyuria in female nursing home residents. These aims will be accomplished by conducting a double blind randomized placebo controlled efficacy trial of two oral cranberry capsules daily versus placebo in a cohort of Connecticut female nursing home residents.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Urine Cultures With Bacteriuria (>100,000 Cfu/ml or >=100,000 Cfu/ml) Plus Pyuria (Any WBC)","timeFrame":"One year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2 Cranberry Capsules","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"2 Placebo Capsules","deltaMin":32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37947276","37068952","29696228","27787564"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":50,"n":92},"commonTop":["skin/soft tissue event","weight loss","Altered mental status","respiratory difficulty","GI disturbance"]}}
