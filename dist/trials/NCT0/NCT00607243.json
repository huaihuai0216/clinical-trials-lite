Thus, new manufacturing methods for smallpox vaccine are urgently needed because previous manufacturing methods using calf lymph are no longer acceptable in the view of current standards. Recently, CJ corporation in Republic of Korea has developed cell-culture derived smallpox vaccine (CJ-50300) which was manufactured by infecting MRC-5 cells. The aim of this clinical trial were to assess safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of CJ-50300.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cutaneous Take Reaction","timeFrame":"7-9 day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Conventional-dose Group","deltaMin":81,"sd":null},{"arm":"Low-dose Group","deltaMin":41,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20600480"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":82},"commonTop":["Axillary pain or lymphadenopathy","Pain at vaccination site","Fatigue","Headache","Myalgia"]}}
