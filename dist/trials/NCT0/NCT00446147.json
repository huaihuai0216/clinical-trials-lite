The investigators therefore performed a prospective randomized double-blind study to determine whether pyridoxine 200 mg/day can prevent the development of HFS when given concurrently with capecitabine. The investigators also tested the ability of pyridoxine to treat primary occurrence of grade 2-3 HFS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cumulative Dose of Capecitabine Until the Development of Grade 2 or Higher Hand-foot Syndrome","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":70000,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pyridoxine","deltaMin":70000,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["20625131"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":180},"commonTop":[]}}
