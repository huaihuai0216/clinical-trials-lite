Part I is a dose-finding study; in Part II, participants will be randomly assigned to receive grazoprevir at the dose determined in Part I in combination with elbasvir. The primary study hypothesis is that the percentage of treatment-naïve participants in the Immediate Treatment Arm of Part II who achieve sustained viral response at 12 weeks after the end of all treatment (SVR12) will be greater than the reference rate of 75%. A separate study arm for cirrhotic participants will also be included in Part II; these participants will receive grazoprevir at the determined dose in combination with elbasvir.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part 2: Percentage of Treatment-naïve Participants in the Immediate Treatment Arm Achieving Sustained Viral Response at 12 Weeks After The End of All Treatment (SVR12)","timeFrame":"12 weeks after end of all therapy in Part 2 (Study Week 24 of Part 2)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 2 Non-cirrhotic Immediate: Grazoprevir + Elbasvir","deltaMin":96.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["27873094"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":31},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Headache","Constipation","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
