Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving vorinostat is more effective then temozolomide or bevacizumab when given together with radiation therapy in treating glioma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Vorinostat","timeFrame":"10 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Feasibility (Vorinostat)","deltaMin":230,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":33,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":132,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":6},"commonTop":["Platelet count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Lymphocyte count decreased","Headache"]}}
