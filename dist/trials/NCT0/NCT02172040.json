Kitov Pharma Ltd. (Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug product (FCDP) consisting of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib, as a \"convenience reformulation\" FCDP to facilitate and improve patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual components, amlodipine and celecoxib.\n\nThe formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a single immediate release tablet. However, for this study, two separate capsules were utilized: one containing a commercial celecoxib capsule (Celebrex®) or matched placebo capsule and one containing a commercial amlodipine besylate tablet (Norvasc®) or matched placebo tablet.\n\nThe study hypothesis was that treatment with the amlodipine besylate containing capsule plus the celecoxib containing capsule would reduce blood pressure (BP) in subjects with hypertension with an efficacy that is not substantially inferior to the effect of amlodipine besylate alone (i.e., the amlodipine containing capsule plus the matched placebo for the celecoxib capsule).\n\nThe United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved KIT-302, under the brand name Consensi® (amlodipine and celecoxib) tablets \\[New Drug Application (NDA) 210045\\] for the following indication: \"patients for whom treatment with amlodipine for hypertension and celecoxib for osteoarthritis are appropriate. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\"","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Average Daytime (9:00 to 21:00) Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBPday) - Primary Endpoint","timeFrame":"Baseline and 2 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Amlodipine+Celecoxib","deltaMin":-10.6,"sd":9.2},{"arm":"Amlodipine+Placebo","deltaMin":-8.83,"sd":8.13},{"arm":"Placebo+Celecoxib","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":8.8},{"arm":"Placebo+Placebo","deltaMin":-2.11,"sd":8.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"= 0.491"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":49},"commonTop":["Headache","Oedema peripheral","Joint swelling","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea"]}}
