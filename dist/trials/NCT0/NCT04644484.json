The trial will enroll the World Health Organization (WHO) Category III rabies exposure subjects. The subject's death and rabies data will be reviewed by Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) to confirm the safety. Besides, rabies vaccine would be administered after Study Drug in each group.\n\nThis trial is proposed to further the licensure of SYN023 to provide an effective PEP alternative available to those exposed persons who need such a product. A placebo-controlled rabies trial is unethical thus HRIG is selected as the control group. Rabies immune globulin from equine and human sources (HRIG) have been evaluated in many trials and HRIG is the standard of care in China.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rabies Virus Neutralizing Activity (RVNA) of Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) at Study Day 8","timeFrame":"Day 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Group: SYN023+Rabies Vaccine","deltaMin":4.346,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group: Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG)+Rabie Vaccine","deltaMin":0.232,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34483020","33091433","40812204","40479926"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":750},"commonTop":["Administration site swelling","Administration site pain","Administration site erythema","Headache","Vaccination site pain"]}}
