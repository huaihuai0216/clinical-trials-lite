In addition, this study continued to provide tafamidis to Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx-006 (a 1-year, open-label extension study to Protocol Fx-005 which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tafamidis) or non-Val30Met subjects who had completed Protocol Fx1A-201 (a Phase 2, open-label study to evaluate TTR stabilization, safety, and tolerability of tafamidis) for up to 10 years or until subjects had access to tafamidis for ATTR-PN via prescription. Upon regulatory approval for the treatment of ATTR-PN in their respective country and access to prescription tafamidis, subjects may have been withdrawn from the study. Such subjects were considered study completers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Val30Met Group: Neuropathy Impairment Score Lower Limb (NIS-LL) Score at Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline (i.e. last measurement prior to first dose) of B3461020 (Fx-005)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Val30Met: Tafamidis Then Tafamidis","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":10.8},{"arm":"Val30Met: Placebo Then Tafamidis","deltaMin":11.6,"sd":14.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","France","Germany","Italy","Portugal","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32107748","31353964","30558645","28758793","27494299"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=FX1A-303&StudyName=Safety%20And%20Efficacy%20Evaluation%20Of%20Fx-1006A%20In%20Subjects%20With%20Transthyretin%20Amyloidosis"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":38},"commonTop":["Urinary Tract Infection","Fall","Thermal Burn","Influenza","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
