Isotretinoin may help neuroblastoma cells become more like normal cells, and grow and spread more slowly. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and make it more likely that the tumor can be surgically removed. It is not yet known what is the minimal amount of chemotherapy needed to achieve sufficient tumor shrinkage to control intermediate risk neuroblastoma and prevent tumor recurrence or metastases.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase III trial is designed to reduce therapy for patients with favorable biology intermediate risk neuroblastoma by decreasing the number of chemotherapy cycles administered and by allowing for up to 50% residual tumor volume for patients with localized disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) Rates","timeFrame":"3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 2 (Chemotherapy, Surgery)","deltaMin":99.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 3 (Chemotherapy, Surgery)","deltaMin":93.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 4 (Chemotherapy, Surgery, Antineoplastic Therapy)","deltaMin":88.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":189,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Netherlands","New Zealand","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31386611","30444686"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31386611/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":175},"commonTop":["58300-Neutrophil count decreased","13200-Anemia","65800-Platelet count decreased","88500-White blood cell decreased","44800-Infections and infestations - Other specify"]}}
