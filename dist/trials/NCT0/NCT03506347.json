The use of intraosseous regional administration (IORA) of vancomycin requires the use of a tourniquet for the duration of the procedure. Many surgeons prefer to perform the surgery with tourniquet use minimised or without a tourniquet at all. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether IORA vancomycin can achieve effective tissue concentrations with tourniquet use minimised.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Vancomycin Concentration in Fat","timeFrame":"Approximately 60 minutes post surgical incision","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vancomycin 15mg/kg IV","deltaMin":6,"sd":0.85},{"arm":"Vancomycin 500mg Intraosseous","deltaMin":40.5,"sd":8.08}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35091036"],"seeAlso":["https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
