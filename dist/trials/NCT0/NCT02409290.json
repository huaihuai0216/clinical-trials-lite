Despite the availability and effectiveness of affordable six-month treatments for tuberculosis (TB), the worldwide control of this disease is currently being impacted by the emergence of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). MDR-TB refers to TB that is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. These are the two most powerful first-line drugs used to treat pulmonary TB. MDR-TB usually develops while a person is taking TB treatment due to either inappropriate treatment or failure of patients to comply with their treatment. This strain of drug-resistant bacteria can also be spread to other people through the air. With the incident rate of MDR-TB on the rise, there is a need to investigate optimal treatment regimens using effective drugs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"STREAM Stage 2 Primary Outcome Measure (the Proportion of Patients With a Favourable Outcome at Week 76)","timeFrame":"76 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regimen A (Long Regimen)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen B (Control Regimen)","deltaMin":133,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen C (Oral Regimen)","deltaMin":162,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen D (6-month Regimen)","deltaMin":122,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["Ethiopia","Georgia","India","Moldova","Mongolia","South Africa","Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20442432","17639223","16845631","17624830","23844450","19779624","16837502","12519922","15664227","19246019","22391540","21144235","16776446","2521683","25057101","25134476","2223692","19386845","21956950","15478070","17241772","17876386","12109926","21228407","16472283","18651388","17284508","11909831","16304291","11180026","12709719","19846355","9687407","18362186","21150558","38462751","30865791","26929418"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ctu.mrc.ac.uk/our_research/research_areas/tuberculosis/studies/stream_stage2/","http://www.theunion.org/what-we-do/research/clinical-trials"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":32},"commonTop":["Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (SMQ)","Hepatic disorders (SMQ)","Metabolism and nutrition disorders","Investigations","Hearing and vestibular disorders (SMQ)"]}}
