Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether docetaxel, prednisone, and bevacizumab are more effective than docetaxel and prednisone in treating prostate cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Duration of study (up to 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Docetaxel + Placebo","deltaMin":21.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Docetaxel + Bevacizumab","deltaMin":22.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.181"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":33,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38992025","34616010","34028627"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":237,"n":505},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Neutrophils/granulocytes (ANC/AGC)","Hemorrhage pulmonary/upper respiratory","Proteinuria","Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)"]}}
