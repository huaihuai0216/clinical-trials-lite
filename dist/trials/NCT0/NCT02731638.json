There is currently little evidence to guide the treatment of fungal keratitis beyond topical anti-fungal drops, though intrastromal voriconazole and oral antifungal treatments are used as well. This study will provide evidence to guide the treatment of fungal keratitis in the future. The purpose of this study is to determine differences in microbiological cure for 3-day repeat cultures between different antifungal treatments. For this study, there will be 1:1 randomization to one of these two treatment groups: 1) topical natamycin plus intrastromal voriconazole injection or 2) topical natamycin alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Culture Positivity at Day 3 Using Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) Wet Mount to Test for Fungus","timeFrame":"3 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intrastromal Voriconazole Plus Natamycin","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Natamycin Alone","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.26"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States","India"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":35},"commonTop":["Therapeutic Penetrating Keratoplasty","Perforation","Glaucoma","Hypopyon","Nonhealing Ulcer"]}}
