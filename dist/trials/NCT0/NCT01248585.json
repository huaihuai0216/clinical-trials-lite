Using dexamethasone to prevent pain like this has been studied in a few people and seems promising, but it is not clear if it can decrease the pain or prevent the pain flare before it happens.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Radiation-induced Pain Flare Incidence","timeFrame":"10 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dexamethasone","deltaMin":39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":53,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26489389","29156903","28196208","27138964"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":147},"commonTop":["Bone pain","Fatigue","Constipation","Nausea","Insomnia"]}}
