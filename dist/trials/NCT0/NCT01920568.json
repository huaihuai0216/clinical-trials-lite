The study is designed to provide data to a large global dataset of phase-III studies including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and all solid tumors, plus multiple myeloma, to support the regulatory approval for marketing and patient access to denosumab for the prevention of SREs in Chinese subjects with bone metastases from solid tumors. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the percent change from baseline to Week 13 in the bone marker urinary amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (uNTx) corrected for urine creatinine (uNTx/uCr) in subjects treated with denosumab to those treated with zoledronic acid. The study is designed to test the superiority of denosumab over zoledronic acid.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change (Chg) From Baseline (BL) to Week (Wk)13 in Urinary Amino-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Type I Collagen Corrected for Urine Creatinine (uNTx/uCr)","timeFrame":"Baseline (BL) and Week (Wk) 13","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Denosumab 120 mg","deltaMin":-81.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Zoledronic Acid 4 mg","deltaMin":-75.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["China","Singapore","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":46,"n":326},"commonTop":["Anaemia","White blood cell count decreased","Decreased appetite","Neutrophil count decreased","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
