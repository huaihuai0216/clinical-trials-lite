This comparison will ensure a more informed assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of Calcipotriol 50 Mcg/g Plus Betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as Dipropionate) Topical Suspension while also establishing the optimal treatment duration in psoriasis vulgaris on the non-scalp regions of the body (trunk and/or limbs).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Controlled Disease According to the Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity (IGA) at Weeks 4","timeFrame":"4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LEO 80185","deltaMin":64,"sd":null},{"arm":"Betamethasone","deltaMin":60,"sd":null},{"arm":"Calcipotriol","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Topical Suspension Vehicle","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":59,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.leopharmatrials.com/en"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":482},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}
