Participants will be randomized to receive placebo or AGB101 (220 mg), once daily for 78 weeks. Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of AGB101 compared with placebo on clinical progression as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score From Baseline","timeFrame":"78 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Oral Tablet","deltaMin":1.1,"sd":2},{"arm":"AGB101 220 mg Tablet","deltaMin":0.9,"sd":1.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":83},"commonTop":["Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders","Injury, poisoning and procedural complications","Infections and infestations","Nervous system disorders","Psychiatric disorders"]}}
