Analysis of primary and key efficacy was performed at Day 28 of Treatment Period 6. Safety was monitored throughout the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Participants Who Achieved and Maintained Reduction in Serum Uric Acid (sUA) < 6 Milligrams Per Deciliter (mg/dL) for At Least 80% of The Time During Treatment Period 6 (Month 6)","timeFrame":"Month 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SEL-212A (Low-dose)","deltaMin":0.48,"sd":null},{"arm":"SEL-212B (High-dose)","deltaMin":0.56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.04,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":40,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":37},"commonTop":["Gout","COVID-19","Infusion related reaction","Hypertriglycerideaemia","Hypertension"]}}
