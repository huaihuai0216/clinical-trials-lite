The main objective of this study is to determine if there is a better medication strategy to prevent blood from clotting and at the same time minimising the number of complications.\n\nThere are two medication strategies:\n\n* Study group: Dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor combined with aspirin) for 1 month, and then ticagrelor alone for another 23 months OR\n* Control group: Standard treatment, being dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor or clopidogrel combined with aspirin) for 12 months, and then aspirin alone indefinitely","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Composite of All-cause Mortality or Non-fatal New Q-wave Myocardial Infarction (MI)","timeFrame":"2 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Treatment Strategy","deltaMin":304,"sd":null},{"arm":"Reference Treatment Strategy","deltaMin":349,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":130,"countries":["Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Singapore","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30166073","39875171","35260381","35229616","35041147","34533034","33066794","33065080","32941872","32838554","32762446","32006156","31925529","31876907","31845894","31693078","31623758","31557763","30888959","30852547"],"seeAlso":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31858-0"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1459,"n":7980},"commonTop":[]}}
