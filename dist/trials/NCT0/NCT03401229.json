The effect of benralizumab on nasal polyps will be assessed over a 56 weeks of treatment period in patients with severe bilateral nasal polyposis who are still symptomatic despite standard of care therapy, i.e current use of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) and prior surgery and/or use of systemic corticosteroids. The first 200 patients that complete the 56-week treatment will have a 6 month follow-up (FU) period without dosing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Total NPS at Week 40","timeFrame":"Baseline to week 40","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Benra 30 mg","deltaMin":-0.36,"sd":1.66},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.17,"sd":1.18}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":99,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34599979","34110505"],"seeAlso":["https://filehosting-v2.pharmacm.com/api/Attachment/Download?tenantId=80217111&amp;parentIdentifier=D3252C00001&amp;attachmentIdentifier=2230117a-5097-441f-b83c-abd127835e60&amp;fileName=d3252c00001-csp-v4_final_signed_Redacted.pdf&amp;versionIdentifier=","https://filehosting-v2.pharmacm.com/api/Attachment/Download?tenantId=80217111&amp;parentIdentifier=D3252C00001&amp;attachmentIdentifier=dac11fb4-fec1-4658-a069-6959efb08d21&amp;fileName=d3252c00001-sap-ed-3_Redacted.pdf&amp;versionIdentifier="]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":207},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Asthma","Headache","Viral upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
