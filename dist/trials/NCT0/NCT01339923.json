This study will also investigate antibody persistence post primary series and administration of a subsequent booster dose of rMenB+OMV NZ at 11 months of age. In addition, this study will assess the safety and immunogenicity of two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ when administered to healthy children 2 to 10 years of age.\n\nThis study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the concomitant administration of rMenB+OMV NZ with meningococcal C conjugate vaccine (MenC-CRM) according to a 3, 5 and 12-month schedule.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentages of Subjects With Serum Bactericidal Activity Using Human Serum (hSBA) Titers ≥ 4 or hSBA Titers ≥ 5 (Strain M10713) Following a 2-dose Primary Series of rMenB+OMV Vaccination.","timeFrame":"1 month after second vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"B_3h5_11","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"B_68_11","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"71 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["Brazil","Hungary","Peru","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31327652","29253560","28318767"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":252},"commonTop":["INJECTION SITE PAIN","INJECTION SITE ERYTHEMA","PYREXIA","CRYING","IRRITABILITY"]}}
