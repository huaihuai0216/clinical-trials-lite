Investigators hope to discover the best technique for obtaining diagnostic material when patients with a pancreatic mass undergo endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspirate procedure.\n\nThere are currently several techniques for obtaining tissue during endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspirate. The procedure will be performed by either the capillary suction technique or no suction technique.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Diagnostic Yield of Capillary Technique","timeFrame":"up to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Capillary Technique","deltaMin":75.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29272906"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":[]}}
