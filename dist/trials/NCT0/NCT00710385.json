We hypothesize that the abuse liability of buprenorphine/naloxone is lower than that of buprenorphine alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Drug's Breakpoint","timeFrame":"Single measurement taken following each of the 7 IV experimental doses","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Heroin","deltaMin":1200,"sd":200},{"arm":"Naloxone","deltaMin":10,"sd":10},{"arm":"Low Bup Dose","deltaMin":1100,"sd":180},{"arm":"High Bup Dose","deltaMin":1200,"sd":190},{"arm":"Lower Bup/Nal Dose","deltaMin":300,"sd":100},{"arm":"High Bup/Nal Dose","deltaMin":750,"sd":175},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":0}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20403021"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Mild Opioid Withdrawal","urticaria","vomiting","dizziness","chest discomfort"]}}
