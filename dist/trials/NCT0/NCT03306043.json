Subjects from study 200622 will participate in this extension study if they had completed the 32-Week treatment period in study 200622 or if they were withdrawn from the study pre-maturely, but were continued in the study per protocol until 32 Weeks from randomization. Data from this study (205203) and 200622 will be combined to provide up to 52-Week exposure data to further characterize the long-term safety profile of mepolizumab and provide additional data on the clinical benefit in HES subjects beyond 32 Weeks. The duration of the study participation will be 20 Weeks for subjects who continue with mepolizumab treatment via MHE104317/MHE112562 after this open-label extension study; and 28 Weeks for subjects who do not continue with MHE104317/MHE112562.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Common (>=3%) Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"Up to Week 20","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mepolizumab 300 mg SC","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":36,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Russia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34389506"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":102},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Pruritus","Vomiting","Headache","Constipation"]}}
