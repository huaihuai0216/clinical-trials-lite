PPP can be a severe and disabling disease limiting the ability to walk or work. Although studies on the quality of life of patients with PPP are not available, a recent investigation showed that palmoplantar psoriasis (non pustular) has a more important impact on quality of life than plaque psoriasis. This important impact on quality of life is not surprising as palmoplantar psoriasis as well as palmoplantar pustulosis may limit the ability to work or conduct activities with hands or even impair walking. The disease is sometimes associated with psoriasis elsewhere on the body. Current treatments for PPP include topical corticosteroids, cyclosporine, PUVA therapy, methotrexate and acitretin. Response to topical corticosteroids and PUVA therapy is often disappointing presumably because the thickness of the stratum corneum on palms and soles prevents good penetration of topical medications and light. Cyclosporine and methotrexate are sometimes used with success for PPP but there are concerns with long term toxicity of both drugs. Therefore there is a need for new treatments for PPP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Severity Index (PPPASI) Before Crossover","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":30.1,"sd":25.7},{"arm":"Etanercept","deltaMin":7.1,"sd":60.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":["Injection site reaction","Common Cold","Headache","Nausea","Tendinitis"]}}
