The hypothesis is the use of lidocaine patches in the immediate post-operative period will lead to a decrease in the visual analog pain score compared to women who do not use a lidocaine patch in the immediate post-operative period following cesarean delivery. Additionally, a decrease in the use of opioids as pain control compared to patients that do not have a lidocaine patch in place the is anticipated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Visual Analog Pain Score","timeFrame":"the first 72 hours post-operative, up to 4 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lidocaine Patch Group","deltaMin":3.5,"sd":2.3},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":4.1,"sd":2.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.07"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.09"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22715181","22861076"],"seeAlso":["https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2011/bcr.06.2010.3074"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":46},"commonTop":[]}}
