To determine the efficacy of daily low-dose atropine (0.01%) for slowing myopia progression over a two-year treatment period in children aged 5 to less than 13 years (Primary Outcome On-Treatment).\n2. To determine the efficacy of atropine treatment on myopia progression 6 months following cessation of low-dose atropine treatment (Secondary Outcome Off-Treatment).\n\nSynopsis of Study Design The current study is designed as an efficacy study, making effort to maximize adherence to treatment group assignments. After a run-in phase during which all participants are treated with daily artificial tear eyedrops for 2-4 weeks (and glasses are updated if required) to assess their ability to adhere to daily eye drops, participants are randomly assigned to daily atropine or placebo for 24 months, followed by 6 months off treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Group Comparison of Change in Spherical Equivalent Refractive Error.","timeFrame":"At 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Atropine Group","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37440213","39480129"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":125},"commonTop":["Eye Irritiation","Photophobia","Vision Blurred","Allergic Conjunctivitis","Ocular Discomfort"]}}
