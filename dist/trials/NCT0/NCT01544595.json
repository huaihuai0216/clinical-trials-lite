Subjects on secukinumab at the end of treatment period in phase III studies (e.g., ongoing CAIN457A2302 and CAIN457A2303 and potentially other secukinumab phase III studies) were eligible to join this extension study. This extension study was planned to collect an additional 2 years of long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of secukinumab in either continuous or interrupted therapy (randomized withdrawal period) in subjects showing at least partial response to secukinumab and completing treatment period on secukinumab in previous phase III studies. In this extension study, the prefilled syringe (PFS) liquid formulation of secukinumab were used.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent of Participants With Loss of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response up to Week 68","timeFrame":"At week 68 (16 weeks after week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AIN457 150 mg -Randomized Withdrawal Period","deltaMin":49.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"AIN457 300 mg -Randomized Withdrawal Period","deltaMin":25.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"AIN457 150 mg Placebo - Randomized Withdrawal Period","deltaMin":74.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"AIN457 300 mg Placebo - Randomized Withdrawal Period","deltaMin":64.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":182,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Colombia","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Guatemala","Hungary","Iceland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Lithuania","Poland","Romania","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36763857"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":61,"n":545},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Arthralgia","Hypertension","Headache"]}}
