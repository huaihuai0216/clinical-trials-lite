Leuprolide is a synthetic Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue which upon administration can decrease testosterone levels to ≤0.5 ng/mL. Leuprolide Acetate 22.5 mg Depot is a microencapsulated formulation of leuprolide which is released slowly over time and effectively reduces testosterone levels in many patients to ≤0.5 ng/mL for up to three months. In this study Leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg Depot will be administered by intramuscular injection twice over a period of 6 months. The proportion of patients with testosterone ≤0.5 ng/mL evaluated over a period of 168 days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Chemical Castration (Defined as Testosterone Levels ≤ 0.5 ng/mL) at Days 28, 84, and 168.","timeFrame":"168 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Leuprolide Acetate 22.5 mg Depot","deltaMin":98.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30929678"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":163},"commonTop":["TEAE Related Hot Flushes","TEAE Related Fatigue","TEAE Related Injection site pain"]}}
