Study 1501 and Study 1502 were conducted in parallel; Study 1501 was conducted at approximately 30 study sites in North America; Study 1502 was conducted at approximately 30 study sites in Europe, Asia and Australia. Upon completion of the Baseline Period after initial Screening and Baseline charting of seizure frequency, subjects who qualified for the studies were randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind manner to receive either 1 of 2 doses of ZX008 (0.2 mg/kg/day or 0.8 mg/kg/day; maximum dose: 30 mg/day) or placebo. Randomization was stratified by age group (\\< 6 years, â‰¥6 to 18 years) to achieve balance across treatment arms, with the target of 25% of subjects in each age group. All subjects were titrated to their randomized dose over a 14-day Titration Period. Following titration, subjects continued treatment at their randomly assigned dose over a 12-week Maintenance Period. Subjects exiting the study underwent a 2-week taper, unless they enrolled in a follow-on study. Subjects were followed for post-study safety monitoring.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Mean Convulsive Seizures Frequency (MCSF) to the Combined Titration and Maintenance Periods (T+M) in Participants Receiving ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/Day Compared to Placebo","timeFrame":"From Baseline up to 14 weeks [Titration Period (2 weeks) plus Maintenance Period (12 weeks)]","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Study 1: Placebo","deltaMin":-6.71,"sd":24.263},{"arm":"Study 1: ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/Day","deltaMin":-13.11,"sd":25.5},{"arm":"Study 3: Placebo","deltaMin":1.54,"sd":21.966},{"arm":"Study 3: ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/Day","deltaMin":-3.54,"sd":124.132}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37543865","34768178","34676542","33540241","31862249"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":40},"commonTop":["Decreased appetite","Echocardiogram abnormal","Diarrhoea","Pyrexia","Somnolence"]}}
