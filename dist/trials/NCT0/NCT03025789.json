The aim of the present study is to provide additional information on the effectiveness and safety of fexinidazole and to assess its use under conditions as close as possible to those in real life, both in patients treated on an out-patient basis and in the hospital setting, depending on clinical status.\n\nParticipants will receive fexinidazole oral treatment for 10 days. Regular blood draws and lumbar punctures will be performed over 18 months to confirm the cure of the disease. Other assessments will include the recording of adverse events, signs and symptoms of the disease, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms. Treatment compliance, feasibility, and packaging acceptability will be thoroughly assessed in the participants receiving treatment at home. Those participants will complete questionnaires to check that instructions for fexinidazole administration are clear enough and followed correctly.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Whose Treatment Outcome at Month 18 is a Success","timeFrame":"Between the first intake of fexinidazole (Day 1) and the end of the follow-up period (18 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All Treated Patients, Regardless of Treatment Setting","deltaMin":93.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Democratic Republic of the Congo","Guinea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40288399"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":136},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Headache","Nausea","Asthenia","Pyrexia"]}}
