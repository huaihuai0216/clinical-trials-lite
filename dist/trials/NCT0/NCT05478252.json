Participants will either get the currently available semaglutide or the semaglutide which is produced through a new manufacturing process. Participants need to take one injection of semaglutide once a week, on the same day of every week. Participants will have a total of 11 clinic visits and the study will last for about 35 weeks (approximately 8 months).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"From baseline (week 0) to end of treatment (week 28)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide J","deltaMin":-1.7,"sd":1},{"arm":"Semaglutide B","deltaMin":-1.6,"sd":1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":65,"countries":["United States","Canada","Poland","Slovakia","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":291},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Vomiting","Headache"]}}
