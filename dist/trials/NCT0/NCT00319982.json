Diltiazem is a commonly used medication for the treatment of high blood pressure and studies on animals with HCM suggest that diltiazem decreases disease development. This study specifically targets individuals in the \"prehypertrophic\" phase of HCM-- those with documented sarcomere gene mutations without echocardiographic or EKG evidence of LVH, and therefore without a clinical diagnosis of HCM.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study is that starting diltiazem administration early in life (in the prehypertrophic phase) will decrease the progression of HCM in individuals with sarcomere gene mutations. This will be assessed by looking at an improvement in the heart's ability to relax using echocardiography, as well as exploratory analyses of a broad range of features reflecting the heart's structure and function.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Increase, Stability of, or Decrease in the Decline of Diastolic Function as Reflected by the Global Early Myocardial Relaxation (E') Velocity","timeFrame":"Baseline and final study visits","effectByArm":[{"arm":"I- Diltiazem","deltaMin":-0.06,"sd":0.27},{"arm":"II- Placebo","deltaMin":-0.21,"sd":0.42}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.75"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11104788","11956238","12081993","16785342","25543971","20818890","23549607","23690394","21943931","27590665"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":["Lightheadeness","Shortness of Breath","Nausea/GI distress","Chest Pain","Fatigue"]}}
