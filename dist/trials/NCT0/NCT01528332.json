At the same time, this study will gather information on side effects associated with use of the Pain Relief Patch. The study will compare the Pain Relief Patch to a patch that is similar in appearance, but which shines a different, presumed nontherapeutic, wavelength of light.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (Mean of Three Measurements at Screening, Prior to Treatment Visit 1 and Treatment Visit 1 Pretreatment) in the Average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Intensity Over the 5 Treatment Days","timeFrame":"Baseline (Visit 1/day -7, at home and Visit 2/day +1), Treatment (Visits 2-6 post treatment/days +1 to +14)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pain Relief Patch","deltaMin":-1.24,"sd":0.11},{"arm":"Control PRP Device","deltaMin":-0.87,"sd":0.11}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39109241"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":85},"commonTop":["Headache","General Disorders","Gastrointestinal disorders","Infections and Infestations","Ear and labyrinth disorders"]}}
