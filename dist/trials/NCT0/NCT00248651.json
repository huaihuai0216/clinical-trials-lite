Symptoms can include stomach pain or discomfort, bloating, fullness after eating meals, and nausea. These symptoms often interfere with school and work, and weight loss may occur due to dietary restrictions.\n\nThe hypothesis of this study was that antidepressant therapy is more effective than placebo in relief of the symptoms of functional dyspepsia, adjusting for psychological and psychiatric co-morbidity. The study also examined if antidepressant therapy reduces disability and improves quality of life in functional dyspepsia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Self-Report of Adequate Relief of Dyspepsia (Yes/No) For at Least 50% of Weeks 3 -12 of Treatment","timeFrame":"3 weeks through 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Amitriptyline","deltaMin":53,"sd":null},{"arm":"Escitalopram","deltaMin":38,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":40,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29199141","25921377","25761431","22343090"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":97},"commonTop":["Drowsiness or Somnolence","Nausea/Vomiting","Dizziness","Headache","Anxiety"]}}
