Several trials suggest triple low-dose combination therapy may be highly effective in terms of achieving blood pressure (BP) control without increasing adverse effects. This trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of GMRx2 in participants with high blood pressure compared to dual combinations.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Difference in Change in Home Seated Mean Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) From Randomization to Week 12","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GMRx2","deltaMin":-4,"sd":0.45},{"arm":"Dual - TA","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"Dual - TI","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":0.51},{"arm":"Dual - AI","deltaMin":0.4,"sd":0.62}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":89,"countries":["United States","Australia","Czechia","New Zealand","Poland","Sri Lanka","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39426836"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":859},"commonTop":["Blood glucose increased","Hyponatremia","Blood uric acid increased","Headache","Hypokalemia"]}}
