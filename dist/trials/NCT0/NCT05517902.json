Autografting is the usual treatment for DPT burns.\n\nIt works to close the wound, but can cause other problems:\n\n* Donor sites are painful, can become infected or scarred, or can even become full thickness (FT) wounds themselves\n* Treatment problems can require more grafting\n* Additional surgery increases the risk of medical problems caused by the treatment\n\nStratatech is trying to find a safe and effective alternative to autografting to promote the healing of severe burns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether StrataGraft treatment eliminates or reduces the need for autografting and promotes wound closure in a pediatric population with thermal burns that contain intact dermal elements and for which autografting is clinically indicated (DPT burns).\n\nParticipants were enrolled into one of two age-based cohorts: 2 to \\< 12 years and 12 to ≤ 17 years to receive a single application of StrataGraft, in up to 3 non-contiguous DPT burn areas located on the same extremity or plane of the torso.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Confirmed Complete Closure of StrataGraft Treatment Sites Without Autograft Within 12 Weeks of StrataGraft Application","timeFrame":"Up to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2 to < 12 Years Age Group Cohort","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1},"commonTop":["Atelectasis","Bronchitis","Pruritus","Rash","Wound infection"]}}
