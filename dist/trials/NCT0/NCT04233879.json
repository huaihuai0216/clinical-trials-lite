The primary objectives are to evaluate the antiretroviral activity, safety, and tolerability of DOR/ISL compared to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF). The primary hypothesis is that DOR/ISL is noninferior or superior to BIC/FTC/TAF treatment based on the percentage of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\<50 copies/mL at Week 48.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1: DOR/ISL","deltaMin":88.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2: BIC/FTC/TAF","deltaMin":88.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":95,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Canada","Chile","Colombia","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Japan","South Africa","Spain","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40079835"],"seeAlso":["http://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":298},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Headache","Lymphocyte count decreased","Diarrhoea","Accidental overdose"]}}
