There are no approved drugs in the United States (US) for this condition and surgery is often the treatment choice. Strakan is conducting this confirmatory study so the product can be submitted for regulatory approval in the US. Strakan currently markets this product throughout Europe.\n\nThe objective of this study is to determine the effect of nitroglycerin ointment 0.4% (Cellegesic) versus placebo on average pain intensity over every 24 hour period for up to 21 days of treatment in 250 patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity at Days 14-18","timeFrame":"Baseline to Day 18","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cellegesic (Nitroglycerin 0.4%)","deltaMin":-40.4,"sd":3.12},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-34.9,"sd":3.04}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["23815124"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":123},"commonTop":["Headache","Dizziness","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Sinusitis"]}}
