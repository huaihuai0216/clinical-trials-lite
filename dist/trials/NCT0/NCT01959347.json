Secondary objectives include estimating the effect of combined treatment compared to MUS on improving overactive bladder (OAB) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) outcomes separately, need for additional treatment, time to failure and identifying predictors of poor outcomes in this MUI population.\n\nA supplemental study, The Human Microbiome Study of ESTEEM, will evaluate the urinary and vaginal microbiome as it relates to women with MUI, their treatment and unaffected controls.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline UDI Total Score","timeFrame":"3, 6, and 12 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MUS Only","deltaMin":-138.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"MUS+BPTx","deltaMin":-142.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34297969","34237755","32769647","31529007"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":238},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Urinary retention","Back pain","Arthralgia","Dyspareunia"]}}
