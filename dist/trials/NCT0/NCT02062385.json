Approximately 4040 participants at least 6 weeks and up to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination with V260 or placebo will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive either V260 or placebo. Participants will also receive the routine China Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines (oral poliovirus vaccine \\[OPV\\] and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine \\[DTaP\\]) either staggered or concomitantly with V260 or placebo. All participants will be followed for efficacy and safety. Immune responses to OPV and DTaP will be evaluated in a subset of participants. The primary hypothesis of the study states that V260 will be efficacious in preventing any severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis as compared with placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Any Severity of Rotavirus Gastroenteritis","timeFrame":"From 14 days after the third dose of V260 or placebo through the first rotavirus season (up to 15 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V260 With Staggered or Concomitant EPI","deltaMin":34,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo With Staggered or Concomitant EPI","deltaMin":109,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Weeks","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28935470","30808567"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":339,"n":2015},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
