Lower drug doses could have fewer side effects and would make EFV more affordable. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness, over 96 weeks, of standard (600mg) versus reduced dose (400mg) EFV in controlling HIV as part of initial combination antiretroviral therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA <200 Copies/mL 48 Weeks After Randomisation","timeFrame":"48 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"600mg Efavirenz","deltaMin":92.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"400mg Efavirenz","deltaMin":94.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Australia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24522178","25877963","25501988"],"seeAlso":["https://kirby.unsw.edu.au"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":309},"commonTop":["dizziness","rash","upper respiratory tract infection","diarrhoea","headache"]}}
