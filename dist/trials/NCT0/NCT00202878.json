The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of Ezetimibe/Simvastatin Combination 10/40 (single tablet, under the brand VYTORIN in the United States) compared with Simvastatin 40 mg. As per the original protocol, if low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response was inadequate, the dose of simvastatin in the VYTORIN arm or simvastatin arm, could be increased to 80 mg (Note: per June 2011 protocol amendment, criteria for continued use of 80 mg simvastatin were modified and new increases of simvastatin dose to 80 mg were stopped). Clinical benefit will be defined as the reduction in the risk of the occurrence of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death, major coronary events, and stroke.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First Occurrence of Cardiovascular Death, Major Coronary Event, or Non-fatal Stroke (Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Percentage of Participants Experiencing a Qualifying Event)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 9 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ezetimibe/Simvastatin","deltaMin":32.72,"sd":null},{"arm":"Simvastatin","deltaMin":34.67,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.016"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25066560","20435175","26039521","26330412","38018702","36260325","35112882","34620406","34396246","32081289","31314050","30739657","30630361","30396865","29903515","29263150","29151034","28972004","28506979","28291866","28231942","26821621","20599002","19061694","18765432","18376001"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3640,"n":9067},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Myalgia","Pain In Extremity","Dizziness","Back Pain"]}}
