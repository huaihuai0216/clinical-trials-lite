The condition may be associated with acute psychotic episodes and long-term disability despite remission from the acute symptoms. Current management of schizophrenia focuses on the treatment of acute symptoms as well as long-term treatment aimed at preventing relapse after patients have experienced an improvement in acute symptoms. Patients who discontinue treatment have a high likelihood of experiencing relapse within 1-2 years after an acute episode of schizophrenia. Patients who remain on antipsychotic treatment have lower rates of relapse and have milder courses of exacerbation when relapse occurs.The symptoms of schizophrenia may be due to an imbalance in chemicals in the brain, primarily dopamine and serotonin, which enables brain cells to communicate with each other. Asenapine may help to correct the imbalance in dopamine and serotonin. The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of asenapine in preventing relapse/impending relapse (hereafter referred to as 'relapse') in subjects who have been treated with asenapine for symptoms of schizophrenia for 26 weeks. In addition, to determine the safety and tolerability of asenapine for up to 1-year of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Relapse or an Impending Relapse","timeFrame":"time of first relapse up to Day 182 (double blind phase)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Asenapine","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["21367356"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":194},"commonTop":["INSOMNIA","SOMNOLENCE","ANXIETY","WEIGHT INCREASED","HEADACHE"]}}
