This length is defined by hospital standards although it is known that the male urethra has an approximate maximum length of 29 cmA new intermittent catheter developed by Coloplast A/S is a 30-cm-long sterile, ready-to-use, hydrophilic-coated male catheter. There is a lack of clinical data documenting that male ICs that are shorter and more or less flexible than standard catheters can sufficiently empty the bladder of male subjects. This will be tested using ultrasound to measure residual urine in the bladder following catheterisation with new product and standard length catheter.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Residual Urine Volume","timeFrame":"3 catheterisations on 1 day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Test Catheter","deltaMin":12.4,"sd":15.7},{"arm":"Standard Catheter","deltaMin":9.4,"sd":11.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34699062","21358718"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":36},"commonTop":["Burning in the urethra"]}}
