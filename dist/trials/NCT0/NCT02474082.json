The study consists of 2 periods: a screening period of at least one week and up to four weeks, and a treatment period of 24 weeks. During the screening period eligibility of the patients is confirmed. Eligible patients are randomized 1:1 to treatment arm A or B at week 0. Patients in treatment arm A receive secukinumab administered at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 and are followed up for assessments of the study endpoints until week 24. Patients in treatment arm B receive daily doses of Fumaderm® p.o.. Safety and efficacy measurements of secukinumab and Fumaderm® will be performed throughout the study and up to week 24.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Secukinumab","deltaMin":89.52,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fumaric Acid (Initial and Maintenance Therapy)","deltaMin":33.68,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":105},"commonTop":["NASOPHARYNGITIS","DIARRHOEA","ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER","FLUSHING","HEADACHE"]}}
