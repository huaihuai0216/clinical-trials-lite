The purpose of this randomized, two-arm and double blind, double dummy study is to demonstrate that the treatment of a daily dose of 3x10mg dydrogesterone orally is as effective and safe as the daily dose of 3x200 mg micronized progesterone capsules administered intravaginally for the luteal support in patients undergoing IVF. The treatment will start on the day of oocyte retrieval and continue until pregnancy is negative or until week 12 gestation.Patients will be followed after treatment until 30 days after delivery to record any safety and tolerability data of the patient and their newborn(s).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Being Pregnant as Measured by the Presence of Fetal Heart Beats at 12 Weeks´Gestation Using Transvaginal Ultrasound","timeFrame":"12 weeks´ gestation (at visit 6)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dydrogesterone 30 mg","deltaMin":37.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Micronized Progesterone 600 mg","deltaMin":33.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":40,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Finland","Germany","Israel","Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28333318"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":56,"n":518},"commonTop":["Vaginal haemorrhage","Procedural pain","Nausea","Headache","Abdominal pain"]}}
