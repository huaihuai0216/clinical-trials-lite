The research objectives are to evaluate each agent with respect to speed of recovery, mortality, illness severity, and hospital resource utilization. Each agent will be evaluated as add-on therapy to the standard of care (SoC) in use at the local clinics, including remdesivir (provided). The SoC may change during the course of the study based on other research findings. Comparisons of the agents among themselves is not a research objective.\n\nThe study population corresponds to moderately and severely ill patients infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus. Recruitment will target patients already hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19 infection as well as patients being treated for COVID-19 infection in Emergency Departments while waiting to be admitted to the hospital. Patients both in and out of the ICU are included in the study population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Had Recovered by Day 28","timeFrame":"Days 1-28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care + Infliximab","deltaMin":421,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care + Infliximab Matching Placebo","deltaMin":405,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care + Abatacept","deltaMin":414,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care + Abatacept Matching Placebo","deltaMin":397,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care + Cenicriviroc","deltaMin":273,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care + Cenicriviroc Matching Placebo","deltaMin":287,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0793"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0864"},{"comp":"OG004 vs OG005","p":"0.9354"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Mexico","Peru"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40488513","39610848","38662372","37428480","36203544","36172138","34473343"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":125,"n":517},"commonTop":["Pneumonia"]}}
