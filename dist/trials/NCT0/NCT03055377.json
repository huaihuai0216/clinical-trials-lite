Participants will be randomized to double-blind NAC or PBO, yielding two equally-allocated treatment groups. All participants will receive brief weekly cannabis cessation counseling and medication management. The primary efficacy outcome will be the proportion of negative urine cannabinoid tests during the 12-week active treatment, compared between groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Urine Tests With Negative Cannabinoid Results During Treatment","timeFrame":"Weekly urine cannabinoid tests during 12-week active treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"N-acetylcysteine","deltaMin":9.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"14 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39910268"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":98},"commonTop":["Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Nausea","Headache","Insomnia","Vomiting"]}}
