Other goals of the study are to determine if, over time, BG00012 treatment can decrease the number of certain types of brain lesions commonly seen in MS patients and slow down the time it takes for MS to get worse.\n\nOther objectives of the study are to determine the safety and tolerability of BG00012, as well as the effect it may have on tests and evaluations used to assess MS. Additionally, glatiramer acetate is being used to compare its benefits and risks with placebo and BG00012.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Relapse Rate","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.401,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012 240 mg Twice Daily (BID)","deltaMin":0.224,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012 240 mg 3 Times Daily (TID)","deltaMin":0.198,"sd":null},{"arm":"Glatiramer Acetate (GA) 20 mg Injection Once Daily (QD)","deltaMin":0.286,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":195,"countries":["United States","Belarus","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Canada","Costa Rica","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Greece","India","Ireland","Israel","Latvia","Mexico","Moldova","New Zealand","North Macedonia","Poland","Puerto Rico","Romania","Serbia","Slovakia","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37061656","32426039","30918100","28770420","28751099","27733070","26932146","26526385","24131282","22992072"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":79,"n":363},"commonTop":["MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS RELAPSE","FLUSHING","NASOPHARYNGITIS","HEADACHE","URINARY TRACT INFECTION"]}}
