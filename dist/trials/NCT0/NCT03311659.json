The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a single dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' Boostrix vaccine, administered as a booster dose in healthy Russian subjects. An equal number of subjects are expected to be recruited in the following age categories: 4-9 years (children), 10-17 years (adolescents), 18-64 years (adults) and â‰¥65 years (elderly population). By receiving the Boostrix vaccine, the subjects could be protected against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis diseases.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Seroprotected Subjects for Anti-diphtheria (Anti-D).","timeFrame":"At Day 31","effectByArm":[{"arm":"dTpa Group","deltaMin":437,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32845735"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":447},"commonTop":["Headache","Rhinitis","Cough","Oropharyngeal pain","Nausea"]}}
