Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, daunorubicin hydrochloride, idarubicin, and vorinostat, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, stopping them from dividing, or by stopping from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving the drugs in different doses and in different combinations may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy is more effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"EFS assessed for up to 5 years, 2 year EFS reported","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Standard Dose Cytarabine, Daunorubicin Hydrochloride)","deltaMin":0.36,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (High-dose Cytarabine, Idarubicin)","deltaMin":0.41,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm III (Vorinostat, High-dose Cytarabine, Idarubicin)","deltaMin":0.37,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.84"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.42"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":21,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":447,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37935977"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":261},"commonTop":["Anemia","Platelet count decreased","Diarrhea","Nausea","Febrile neutropenia"]}}
