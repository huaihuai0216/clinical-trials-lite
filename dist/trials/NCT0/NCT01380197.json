These painful episodes are thought to result from ischemia caused when small blood vessels are occluded by misshapen, inflexible erythrocytes. Painful episodes are the most common cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and impairment for SCD patients. There is no therapy that completely prevents or directly aborts painful events for all patients. Consequently, treatment for acute VOC is primarily supportive using hydration and medicinal pain control. Every pain medication has the potential to relieve pain but is associated with significant limitations and side effects.\n\nThe primary hypothesis to be tested in this double blind, randomized controlled trial is that Nalbuphine is equivalent to morphine for pain control and patients will suffer fewer episodes of acute chest syndrome. The investigators also expect subjects will report fewer side effects from respiratory depression, abdominal distention from reduced peristalsis, reduced histamine release causing pruritis and still be provided adequate pain control. Further hypotheses to be tested is ability to recruit patient participants while being treated in the Emergency Department and that continuous infusion of Nalbuphine with accompanying patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is safe and effective in controlling pain, requiring less total opiates consumption, while decreasing length of hospitalization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Acute Chest Syndrome","timeFrame":"3 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Randomizing Particiipants to Morphine","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Randomization to Nubain","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
