In trial 42603ATT3002 the efficacy and safety of OROS methylphenidate was assessed in adult subjects with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disease (ADHD). ADHD is a developmental disorder beginning in childhood and characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Data on the number of adult patients with ADHD is limited, but it is estimated that approximately 50% of children with ADHD will have symptoms also in adhulthood. The drug tested in this trial is OROS methylphenidate. The active ingredient is methylphenidate and the tablet is designed to release the active ingredient gradually to ensure an effect, which lasts up to 12 hours. Trial 42603ATT3002 consisted of a 5-week period, where subjects were assigned to either receive placebo (empty drug) or one out of three different dosages of OROS methylphenidate. This 5-week period was followed by a 7-week period, where patients received OROS methylphenidate at their optimal dose. In study 42603ATT3004, subjects who complete 42603ATT3002 are followed for a period of at least 52 weeks to evaluate safety and tolerability of OROS methylphenidate in patients who are treated with OROS methylphenidate over a long period of time.\n\nAmendment: At the end of the open-label period of the present study 42603ATT3004, patients are enrolled into a double-blind placebo-controlled period, which lasts an additional 4 weeks. The purpose of this double-blind placebo-controlled period is to evaluate the maintenance of effect under continued treatment with OROS methlyphenidate in comparison to treatment cessation in those patients, who are randomized into the placebo-group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Frequency of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"Treatment duration for OL extended from 52 wks to 72 wks (International Amendment 2) or 108 wks in Germany.
