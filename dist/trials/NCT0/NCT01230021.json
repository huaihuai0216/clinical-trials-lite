The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (at which rate the substance is distributed and eliminated from the body) and the safety profile of catridecacog (recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII)) in children with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. Young children (1 to less than 6 years old) with congenital FXIII deficiency are evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Area Under the Concentration vs. Time Curve (AUC)","timeFrame":"At pre-dose, 30 minutes, 24 hours, 7, 14, 21 and 30 days after dosing","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Recombinant Factor XIII","deltaMin":250.25,"sd":31.19}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States","Israel","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23834599","25643920"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Pain In Extremity"]}}
