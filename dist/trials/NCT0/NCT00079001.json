It is not yet known whether treatment with zoledronate is effective in preventing bone-related events in patients who have prostate cancer and bone metastases.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well zoledronate works in preventing bone-related events in patients who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and bone metastases.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First Skeletal Related Event","timeFrame":"Up to 10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zoledronic Acid + Androgen Deprivation Therapy","deltaMin":31.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Androgen Deprivation Therapy","deltaMin":28.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.385"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":241,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24590644","33270906"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":60,"n":310},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Myalgia","Nausea","Creatinine increased","Serum calcium decreased"]}}
