Researchers will compare the weight loss in people taking semaglutide (a new medicine) to people taking \"dummy\" medicine. In addition to taking the medicine, participants will also have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how the participant can be more physically active and what participants can do to lose weight. Participants will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment the participant gets is decided by chance. Participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study will last for about 2 years. The participants will have 19 clinic visits and 15 phone calls with the study doctor.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 104 in Body Weight","timeFrame":"From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 104","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-15.9,"sd":12.3},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":8.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":41,"countries":["United States","Canada","Hungary","Italy","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32441473","36655300","39226070","37605636","36216945"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":152},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Vomiting","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
