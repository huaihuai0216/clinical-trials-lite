Paclitaxel is a drug used to treat breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi sarcoma. It blocks cell growth by stopping cell division and may kill cancer cells. It is a type of antimitotic agent. However, there are side-effects and toxicities associated with repeat exposure to this pre-medication regimen. With prolonged use of paclitaxel, especially during weekly regimens, patients are exposed to repeat doses of drugs that prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Side effects include, but are not limited to, insomnia, gastritis, fluid retention, weight gain, mood changes and immune suppression. The information gained from this study may positively influence clinical practice and help researchers develop methods to safely stop pre-medications.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients With Grade 2 or Greater Reactions That Require Parenteral Rescue Medications to Treat an Infusion Hypersensitivity Reaction (HSR) After the First 2 Doses of Paclitaxel With or Without Continued Premedication Dosing","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years and 8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Paclitaxel, Pre-medications)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Paclitaxel)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://cancer.osu.edu"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
