The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants treated with omarigliptin is non-inferior to that in participants treated with sitagliptin. There will be a 2-week run-in period with placebo + metformin prior to the double-blind treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Omarigliptin 25 mg Once Weekly","deltaMin":-0.47,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sitagliptin 100 mg Once Daily","deltaMin":-0.43,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28093853"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":322},"commonTop":[]}}
