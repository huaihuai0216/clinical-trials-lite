While ICD therapy offers survival benefit over drug therapy, there remain significant quality of life (QL) issues. About 50% of patients experience chronic anxiety about receiving an ICD shock. Anxiety and depression in turn appear to predispose to more arrhythmias necessitating ICD therapy. The aims of the current study are:\n\n1. to evaluate a 8-session psychosocial intervention to help patients cope effectively with receiving an ICD for secondary prevention of SCD,\n2. to determine if baseline measures of depression and anxiety predict ICD therapies (i.e., anti-tachycardia pace terminations and shocks); and\n3. to explore if the psychosocial intervention results in less need for appropriate ICD therapies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression Scale at Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Cardiac Care - Men","deltaMin":4.7,"sd":3.41},{"arm":"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy - Women","deltaMin":7.47,"sd":5.02},{"arm":"Usual Cardiac Care - Women","deltaMin":5.35,"sd":3.82},{"arm":"Cognitive Therapy Group - Men","deltaMin":4.12,"sd":4.01}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27415850","21321256"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":77},"commonTop":[]}}
