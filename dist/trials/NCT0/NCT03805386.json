Currently, our standard prescribing is 150 oral morphine equivalents. However, recent studies show that half of the opioids prescribed are not used. We would like to include the patient in the decision making of the opioid prescribing.\n\nWe have designed a randomized controlled trial to prescribe standard (150 oral morphine equivalents) or patient directed (less than or equal to 150 oral morphine equivalents) for pain control.\n\nWe hypothesize that with patient input, there will be a higher utilization of the opioids prescribed. Also, we anticipate a lower number of opioids used overall.\n\nThis study will help us optimize opioid prescribe and evaluate whether patient input can help in this important measure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"# of Opioid Pills Consumed","timeFrame":"6 weeks postop","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":26.7,"sd":0.91},{"arm":"Patient Directed Care","deltaMin":38.4,"sd":1.08}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
