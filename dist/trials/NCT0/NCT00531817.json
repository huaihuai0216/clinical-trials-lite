Patients were randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or placebo IV every 4 weeks. All patients also received stable antirheumatic therapy, including permitted DMARDs. The anticipated time on study treatment was 3-12 months and the target sample size was 500+ individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With an Improvement of at Least 50% in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Score (ACR50) From Baseline at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + DMARDs","deltaMin":30.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + DMARDs","deltaMin":11.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":157,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23305631","21949007"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":79,"n":409},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Urinary Tract Infection","Sinusitis","Diarrhoea","Bronchitis"]}}
