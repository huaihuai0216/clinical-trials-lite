A total of 1020 subjects will be enrolled, 510 per study arm. The subjects will be males and females between 12 and 45 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent, who have mild to moderate facial acne vulgaris.\n\nSubjects will use Duac™Once Daily Gel (once daily in the evening) or clindamycin phosphate gel twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening) for 12 weeks. The subjects will be evaluated for change in lesion counts, investigator's static global assessment (ISGA), subject's global assessment (SGA), local tolerability and AEs/SAEs at Weeks0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (or at early withdrawal). In addition, quality of life measures will be performed at every study visit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Absolute Change in Total Lesion Count From Baseline to Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Duac Once Daily Gel","deltaMin":-55.7,"sd":1.05},{"arm":"Dalin Gel","deltaMin":-51.2,"sd":1.03}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27075705"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":500},"commonTop":["Application site erythema","Nasopharyngitis","Application site pruritus","Application site swelling","Application site pain"]}}
