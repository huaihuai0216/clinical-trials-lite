The secondary objectives are to:\n\n* Assess the effectiveness of sc IFN beta - 1a (Rebif®) therapy in reducing the proportion of patients with CIS converting to CDMS\n* Assess the safety of sc IFN beta - 1a (Rebif®) in the patients with CIS","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time in Month to Clinical Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) From Kaplan-Meier Estimates","timeFrame":"Up to Week 96","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rebif 44 Mcg","deltaMin":15.6,"sd":1.23},{"arm":"No Treatment","deltaMin":17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mslifelines.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":32},"commonTop":["Headache","Fatigue","Chills","Pain","Nausea"]}}
