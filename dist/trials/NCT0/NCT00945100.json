Children ages 3 to \\<8 years with visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/400 in the amblyopic eye will be enrolled in a run-in phase with 2 hours daily patching until no improvement, followed by randomization of eligible patients to patching 2 hours daily versus an average of 6 hours daily (42 hours per week). The primary objective is to determine if increasing patching dosage will improve visual acuity in patients with amblyopia still present after visual acuity has stabilized with initial treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Distribution of 10-week Amblyopic Eye Visual Acuity","timeFrame":"10 weeks after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intensified Treatment","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25695355","23755872"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":83},"commonTop":["New ocular deviation or worsening of preexisting deviation by at least 10 pd"]}}
