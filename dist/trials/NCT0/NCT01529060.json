Through this study, the investigators will try to find out how well phenylbutyrate (NaPBA), also known by name brand \"Buphenyl-TM\", decreases BCAA and branched chain keto chain acids in the blood of patients with MSUD. The investigators hope is that through this research the investigators will be better able to treat these patients.\n\nSubjects with MSUD will take phenylbutyrate (NaPBA) in powder form for a two-week treatment period and powder placebo, a substance with no effect on the body, for a two-week treatment period. They will be given the same amount of powder and undergo the same laboratory testing during both of the two-week treatment periods. The results will be compared once the study is over.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"0-24 Hour AUC Leucine (Samples Collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 Hours)","timeFrame":"24 Hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phenylbutyrate","deltaMin":6217,"sd":5168},{"arm":"Placebo First and Phenylbutyrate Second Group","deltaMin":4616,"sd":4106}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.bcm.edu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["Labs","Gastrointestinal Symptoms","Oral or Nasal Complaints","Neurological Complaints","Minor Skin Complaints"]}}
