Recently, a randomized clinical trial conducted in a single site in The Gambia showed that treatment with oral dose of 2 g azithromycin vs. placebo for all women in labor reduced selected maternal and neonatal infections. However, it is unknown if this therapy reduces maternal and neonatal sepsis and mortality. The A-PLUS trial includes two primary hypotheses, a maternal hypothesis and a neonatal hypothesis. First, a single, prophylactic intrapartum oral dose of 2 g azithromycin given to women in labor will reduce maternal death or sepsis. Second, a single, prophylactic intrapartum oral dose of 2 g azithromycin given to women in labor will reduce intrapartum/neonatal death or sepsis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maternal Death or Sepsis Within 6 Weeks (42 Days) Post-delivery in Intervention vs. Placebo Group.","timeFrame":"Within 6 weeks (42 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":227,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":344,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Bangladesh","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Guatemala","India","Kenya","Pakistan","Zambia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26598777","25280870","25842221","25841891","27988146","23945571","6990333","25479008","25350672","25402227","19300334","27682034","28130432","28658587","20375891","27026482","28697108","12798523","18165392","18771992","2783262","3737039","3419735","8437791","3701114","7898825","9259918","9822511","17181412","26447263","25595580","25687145","22591294","23635050","28468653","28513837","29382352","28885400","28670748","40155106","40155105","37648383","36757318"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":14589},"commonTop":["Severe vaginal pain","Vomited within 15 minutes after study drug administration","Feeling faint or dizzy","Severe abdominal or uterine pain","GI symptoms and other reported side effects"]}}
