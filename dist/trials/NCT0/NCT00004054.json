Hormone therapy may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether hormone therapy plus radiation therapy is more effective with or without combination chemotherapy for prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of hormone therapy plus radiation therapy with or without combination chemotherapy in treating patients who have prostate cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (5-year Rate Reported)","timeFrame":"From the date of randomization to the date of death or last follow-up.
