To resolve blood clots, people in the study get either tenecteplase or alteplase within 4 hours and 30 minutes after stroke. The purpose of this study is to compare how tenecteplase and alteplase improve peoples' recovering of physical activity. Alteplase is standard of care. Tenecteplase is a modified variant of alteplase that is easier to administer and is approved to treat heart attack. This study is to find out whether tenecteplase is as good as alteplase in people with ischaemic stroke.\n\nParticipants are equally put into 2 treatment groups by chance. Participants in one group get tenecteplase as a single injection into a vein. Participants in the other group get alteplase as an injection into a vein (10% of the dose) and the remainder as an infusion over 1 hour.\n\nParticipants are in the study for about 3 months. They are in the hospital for the first week after treatment. Then they visit the study site 1 and 3 months after treatment. At these visits, peoples' ability to independently carry out daily activities is assessed. Scores for physical activity are compared between both treatment groups. The doctors also regularly check the general health of the participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score of 0 or 1","timeFrame":"At Day 90Â±7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tenecteplase Treatment Group","deltaMin":72.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Alteplase Active Control Group","deltaMin":70.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39264623"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mystudywindow.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":115,"n":736},"commonTop":["Constipation","Gingival bleeding","Hypokalaemia","Pneumonia","Urinary tract infection"]}}
