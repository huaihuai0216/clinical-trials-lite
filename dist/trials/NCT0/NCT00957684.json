Part I was a 26-week parallel-group, randomised, placebo-controlled period (8 weeks single-blind placebo baseline, 2 weeks double-blind titration, 12 weeks maintenance, and 4 weeks tapering off). After completing the baseline period, patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 ESL dose levels or to placebo. Part II was a 1-year open-label extension for patients who had completed Part I. The starting dose was 800 mg once daily and could be titrated up or down at 400-mg intervals between 400 and 1200 mg. Part III was an additional 1-year open-label extension for patients who had completed Part II, had participated in the post-Part II study extension, which allowed patients to continue treatment with ESL, or had continued to take ESL in a compassionate use program. ESL starting doses were the same as received at the end of Part II, during post-Part II study extension, or under compassionate use, and could be titrated up or down at 400-mg intervals between 400 and 1200 mg once daily. Part IV was a study extension to allow patients to continue ESL treatment after the end of Part III until marketing authorisation or discontinuation of clinical development.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part I: Seizure Frequency","timeFrame":"12-week maintenance period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.64,"sd":0.0563},{"arm":"ESL 400 mg","deltaMin":6.73,"sd":0.0563},{"arm":"ESL 800 mg","deltaMin":5.66,"sd":0.0558},{"arm":"ESL 1200 mg","deltaMin":5.35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Portugal"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33338829"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":102},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Headache","Somnolence","Diplopia","Nausea"]}}
