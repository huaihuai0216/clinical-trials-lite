Participants will receive chemotherapy alone, or in combination with bevacizumab. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Participants are allowed to continue on bevacizumab, even after stopping chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival: Time From Randomization to Death From Any Cause","timeFrame":"within 6.5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Chemotherapy","deltaMin":9.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy + Bevacizumab","deltaMin":11.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0062"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":300,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Netherlands","Norway","Portugal","Saudi Arabia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38186268","23852309","23168366"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":137,"n":409},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Vomiting","Asthenia","Neutropenia"]}}
