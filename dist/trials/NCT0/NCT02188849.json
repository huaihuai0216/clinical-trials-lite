Material and methods: Fifty healthy older women will be selected for the study. All participants will be subjected to a progressive resistance training program using elastic bands and weights, consisting in three sessions per week lasting 1 hour. Participant will be randomly allocated in a double blind fashion, to receive creatine 5 g per day or an identical placebo. The training and supplementation period will last 12 weeks. At baseline and at the end of the study, body composition will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, rectus femoris cross sectional height and surface will be measured by ultrasound, quadriceps strength will be measured in a quadriceps table and 12 minutes' walk will be assessed. The main outcome measure will be quadriceps cross sectional height. Expected results: We expect that creatine supplementation will increase rectus femoris height over and above the effect of resistance training.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rectus Femoris Cross Sectional Height","timeFrame":"Twelve weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Creatine","deltaMin":17.5,"sd":2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":17.6,"sd":2.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Chile"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":["Pain","Gastroinftestinal symptoms","Falls","Fever"]}}
