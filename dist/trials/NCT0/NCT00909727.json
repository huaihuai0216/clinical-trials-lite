Ivacaftor is a potent and selective potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein. Potentiators are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties of the channel in the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Through Week 24","timeFrame":"baseline through 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.1,"sd":2.1},{"arm":"150 mg Ivacaftor q12h","deltaMin":12.6,"sd":2.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","France","Germany","Ireland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23590265"],"seeAlso":["http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/","http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/","http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/fdalinks"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":26},"commonTop":["Cough","Pyrexia","Cystic fibrosis lung","Oropharyngeal pain","Abdominal pain upper"]}}
