Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids often requires periodic adjustments to medication dosing and frequency levels. This study examines whether it is more beneficial to adjust corticosteroid treatment based on asthma symptoms and/or biomarkers of lung function versus standard medical guidelines.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Treatment Failure (Measured in Days)","timeFrame":"Measured during the 36-week treatment period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Symptom-based Adjustment","deltaMin":196.9,"sd":4},{"arm":"Biomarker-based Adjustment","deltaMin":225.2,"sd":5.6},{"arm":"Guideline-based Adjustment","deltaMin":182.3,"sd":4.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28624608","22968888","20075384"],"seeAlso":["http://www.acrn.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":113},"commonTop":["urgent care for asthma"]}}
