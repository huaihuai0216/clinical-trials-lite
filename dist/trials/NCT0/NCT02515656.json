POLYGYNAX® has been marketed in France since 1969.\n\nNevertheless, despite the well established use of POLYGYNAX®, there is no clinical study supporting the interest of the combination of antifungal and antibiotics agents versus antifungal agent alone.\n\nThe aim of this project is to demonstrate that POLYGYNAX® is more effective than miconazole in the treatment of women experiencing symptoms of infectious vaginitis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical Treatment Efficacy Assessed by the Investigator After Thorough Gynaecological Examination and Patient's Interview at End of Treatment Visit","timeFrame":"15 days after first treatment administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"POLYGYNAX®","deltaMin":275,"sd":null},{"arm":"Miconazole + Placebo","deltaMin":268,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Czechia","France","Serbia","Slovakia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":325},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
