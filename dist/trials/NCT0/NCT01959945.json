Thus, the initial introduction of Flublok Quadrivalent Formulation (RIV4) into the pediatric population will evaluate immunogenicity and safety older children and adolescents, aged 6-17. This clinical trial is designed to demonstrate safety and non-inferior immunogenicity of Flublok-Q in pediatric subjects 6-17 years of age as compared to IIV4. Positive results in this study may support further studies in younger children.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Reporting Solicited Injection Site and Systemic Events and Unsolicited Adverse Events Following Vaccination With Quadrivalent Vaccine.","timeFrame":"Day 0 up to Day 28 post vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Study Group 1, Flublok Cohort A","deltaMin":47,"sd":null},{"arm":"Study Group 3, Flublok Cohort B","deltaMin":16,"sd":null},{"arm":"Study Group 2, Fluarix Cohort A","deltaMin":53,"sd":null},{"arm":"Study Group 4, Fluarix Cohort B","deltaMin":18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29610401"],"seeAlso":["http://www.proteinsciences.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":80},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Vomiting","Injection site pain","Oropharyngeal pain","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
