The etiology of the cough associated with IPF is unclear but it is often so severe that it adversely effects the patient's quality of life. We propose that thalidomide specifically suppresses the cough associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis via its anti-inflammatory properties, by suppressing the excessive functional up-regulation of sensory fibers with in the respiratory tract of patients with IPF.\n\nThis study is a Phase III, double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover trial testing the efficacy of thalidomide in suppressing the chronic cough of IPF. The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of thalidomide administered daily for 12 weeks to suppress the chronic cough in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as measured by cough specific questionnaires, scales and improved quality of life.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy of Thalidomide in Suppressing the Chronic Cough of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Using the Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire.","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm Thalidomide 1st, Placebo 2nd (Intervention Thalidomide)","deltaMin":47.3,"sd":13.7},{"arm":"Arm Thalidomide 1st, Placebo 2nd (Intervention Placebo)","deltaMin":55.2,"sd":14.4},{"arm":"Arm Placebo 1st, Thalidomide 2nd (Intervention Placebo)","deltaMin":61.6,"sd":11.9},{"arm":"Arm Placebo 1st, Thalidomide 2nd (Intervention Thalidomide)","deltaMin":44.5,"sd":12.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22986377"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["constipation"]}}
