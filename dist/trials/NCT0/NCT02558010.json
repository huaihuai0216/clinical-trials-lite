While the standard management of post-surgical pain involves a multimodal approach, opioids provide the predominant benefit. However, opioid use is associated with many adverse effects, including nausea, constipation, and pruritus. Perioperative methadone may decrease total opioid consumption and adverse effects as well as improve satisfaction with pain management after scoliosis repair.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Post-operative Opioid Consumption (mg/kg)","timeFrame":"72 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methadone Group","deltaMin":0.267,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":0.34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["2066846","20418538","20418301","22037641"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":["Respiratory depression"]}}
