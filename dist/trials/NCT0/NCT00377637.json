Patients were randomized to receive either MMF (1.5 g twice daily \\[bid\\]) or cyclophosphamide (0.5-1.0 g/m\\^2 in monthly pulses) in the induction phase. Those patients meeting criteria for response were re-randomized for entry into the maintenance phase, to receive either MMF (1 g bid) or azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Induction Phase: Number of Patients Showing Treatment Response","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intravenous Cyclophosphamide","deltaMin":98,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mycophenolate Mofetil","deltaMin":104,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.478"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":108,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Portugal","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22922564","22087680","21080348","20039429","19933596"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":180},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Arthralgia","Vomiting","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
