If this works, prostate cancer treatments can be prescribed that match the location of the disease. PSMA is radiolabeled with Gallium-68 (Ga-68). This means a participant receives a small dose of radiation from the drug - less than the annual radiation limit for a medical worker.\n\nTo test this new drug, participants will receive an injection of Ga-68 PSMA and then have a PET scan. This PET scan, and the reported results, will be entered into the medical record and shared with the treating oncologists.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sensitivity of Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) for the Detection on a Per Patient Basis","timeFrame":"Up to 12 months after the 68Ga PSMA PET scan","effectByArm":[{"arm":"68Ga PSMA PET Scan","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26682756","27207581","25791990","25411132","28012435"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":[]}}
