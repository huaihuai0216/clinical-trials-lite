Randomization was stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 copies/mL or \\> 100,000 copies/mL) at screening. A treatment duration of 96 weeks was planned, with the option for subjects in FTC/RPV/TDF STR arm to receive treatment following the Week 96 visit until FTC/RPV/TDF STR is commercially available or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate development in that country.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FTC/RPV/TDF","deltaMin":85.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"EFV/FTC/TDF","deltaMin":81.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":151,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":394},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Abnormal dreams","Dizziness"]}}
