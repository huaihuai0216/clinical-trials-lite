The current use of cetuximab associated with radiotherapy in localized disease and associated with platinum-based chemotherapy in the first-line setting stresses the need for new therapeutic options at later stages of SCCHN.Vinca-alkaloids demonstrated activity in SCCHN. Vinflunine demonstrated superior antitumour activity to vinorelbine in preclinical animal models. Recent preliminary phase I results of the vinflunine plus methotrexate combination in SCCHN, based on a clinical review, show encouraging antitumour activity and an acceptable safety profile. Therefore the combination of vinflunine and methotrexate appears a promising salvage regimen after platinum failure.\n\nThe present study has been designed as a multicenter, randomised phase III study which will compare the combination of IV vinflunine with methotrexate to methotrexate alone in SCCHN patients having failed platinum-based therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival in the ITT Population (Months)","timeFrame":"Participants will be followed till death (if they are not lost for follow-up), an expected average of 7.5 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vinflunine Plus Methotrexate","deltaMin":7.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Methotrexate","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.8329"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":106,"n":225},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Anaemia","Weight decreased","Stomatitis","Asthenia"]}}
