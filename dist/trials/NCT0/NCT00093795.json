Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying three different combination chemotherapy regimens and comparing how well they work in treating women who have undergone surgery for node-positive breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-free Survival: Any Recurrence, Contralateral Breast Cancer, Second Primary Cancer, Death From Any Cause Prior to Recurrence or Second Primary Cancer","timeFrame":"5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1: TAC X 6","deltaMin":80.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2: AC X 4 Then P X 4","deltaMin":82.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 3: AC X 4 Then PG X 4","deltaMin":80.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":35,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23940225"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":277,"n":1601},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Myalgia","Bone pain","Peripheral sensory neuropathy"]}}
