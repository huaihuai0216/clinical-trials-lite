The trial investigated whether lapatinib, when added to the chemotherapy regimen, capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CapeOx), extended the time to progression and overall survival. Tumor ErbB2 (HER2) status had to be known before trial entry. CapeOx was administered to all patients, and patients were randomly assigned to receive either lapatinib or placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival at the Time of Primary Analysis","timeFrame":"From date of randomization till death due to any cause, assessed up the cut-off date for Primary Analysis (24-Sep-2012) (average of 4 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CapeOx Plus Lapatinib","deltaMin":12.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"CapeOx Plus Placebo","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3492"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":183,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","Estonia","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Puerto Rico","Russia","South Korea","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27737436","26628478"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":73,"n":270},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Vomiting","Decreased appetite","Fatigue"]}}
