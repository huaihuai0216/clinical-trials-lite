As in the investigators' previous, pilot study, the investigators will use the novel approach of procuring tissue specimens from normal, healthy men who might be chose to use a male hormonal contraceptive regimen were it available. The investigators will employ state of the art techniques such as laser capture microdissection (LCM) and cDNA microarrays to determine the tissue-specific consequences of male hormonal contraceptive regimens on the prostate. The results will help guide the design, safety monitoring, and selection of male hormonal contraceptive agents and provide valuable insights into prostate human prostate biology.\n\nThe investigators will test the hypothesis that exogenous T administration that results in increased circulating T and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels will increase intraprostatic concentrations of T and its metabolite DHT.\n\nThe investigators will test the hypothesis that the addition of a potent 5α-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, or the progestin, Depomedoxyprogesterone (IM DMPA), to T administration in young and middle aged men will decrease intraprostatic DHT and increase intraprostatic T concentrations compared to T alone.\n\nThe investigators will test the hypothesis that the addition of a 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride or the progestin IM DMPA to exogenous T, by reducing intraprostatic DHT, will decrease prostate epithelial proliferation, assessed by Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67LI), and increase apoptosis, assessed by caspase-3 expression, and decrease androgen-regulated protein expression such as prostate specific antigen (PSA).\n\nThe investigators will test the hypothesis that the addition of a 5α-reductase inhibitor or the progestin IM DMPA to exogenous T, by modifying the intraprostatic hormonal milieu, will alter prostate epithelial gene expression. Specifically, the investigators expect that the addition of the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride or the progestin IM DMPA to exogenous T, will result in decreased expression of androgen-regulated genes such as PSA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA)","timeFrame":"10 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1) Placebo","deltaMin":0.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"2) Testosterone Gel","deltaMin":0.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"3) T Gel +Dutasteride","deltaMin":0.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"4) T Gel+ DMPA","deltaMin":0.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16932251","16172147","15105794","11750242","17237035","7979239","12824459","1699965","3629749","14760063","2465302","9135694","16882745","16940442"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":8},"commonTop":["headache","Fatigue","rash","abscess"]}}
