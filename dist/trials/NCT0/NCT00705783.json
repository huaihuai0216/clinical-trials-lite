Phase 1 was designed to allow for a patient to be converted from their current antipsychotic treatment to oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy (oral conversion phase from 4 to 6 weeks). During Phase 2, the patient was stabilized on oral non-generic aripiprazole monotherapy (oral stabilization phase from a minimum of 4 weeks to a maximum of 12 weeks). Once the patient was stabilized in Phase 2, they entered Phase 3, the single-blind intramuscular (IM) depot aripiprazole stabilization phase. The goal of the phase was to stabilize the patient on the IM depot aripiprazole formulation for a minimum of 12 weeks to a maximum of 36 weeks. When the patient was stabilized, they were eligible to be randomized into the double-blind IM depot maintenance phase (Phase 4). During Phase 4, the patient was assessed for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and/or impending relapse for up to 52 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Exacerbation of Psychotic Symptoms/Impending Relapse","timeFrame":"Baseline of the depot maintenance phase to the end of the study (Week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aripiprazole Depot","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Depot","deltaMin":209,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":110,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Bulgaria","India","Malaysia","Mexico","Philippines","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22697189","25711509","23615694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":632},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Headache","Akathisia","Anxiety","Weight increased"]}}
