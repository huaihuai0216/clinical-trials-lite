This medical condition can cause weakening of the bones and damage other organs. This can lead to many health problems, and sometimes death. Phosphorus is in much of the food we eat, and is helpful to us in small amounts. Patients with kidney failure have trouble getting rid of the phosphorus eaten in food. Dialysis can help remove some of the phosphorus, but often patients must take a phosphate binder like PhosLo®, Renagel®, or Renvela® to bring the blood phosphorus levels back to normal. The purpose of this study is to see if KRX-0502 (ferric citrate) is safe and effective as a phosphate binder.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Serum Phosphorus From Baseline to End of Treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline and day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1 g/Day","deltaMin":-0.1,"sd":1.285},{"arm":"6 g/Day","deltaMin":-1.86,"sd":1.692},{"arm":"8 g/Day","deltaMin":-2.13,"sd":1.998}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40576086","23369827"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":51},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Faeces discoloured","Hypocalcaemia","Nausea","Pain in extremity"]}}
