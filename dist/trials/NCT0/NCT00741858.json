One material (DuraGen) is a non-suturable collagen matrix that is applied over the defect if brain coverings (dura); the other (DuraGuard) is made out of bovine pericardium and has to be sutured during application. The study compares these two materials used for duraplasty of patients undergoing Chiari surgery in a prospective randomized fashion to check the rate of surgical complications associated with each material, patient's outcomes, length of surgery and the hospital stay, etc.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Physical Health Quality of Life","timeFrame":"7 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DuraGen (Sutureless)","deltaMin":31.4,"sd":2.01},{"arm":"DuraGuard (Suturable)","deltaMin":35.61,"sd":1.87}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/departments___programs/departments/neurosurgery/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":16},"commonTop":["meningitis"]}}
