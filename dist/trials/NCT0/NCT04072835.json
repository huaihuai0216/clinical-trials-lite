Participants were provided with an ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring System (CMS) to help document PSVT episodes. The CMS was self-applied by the participant, when they felt the onset of PSVT symptoms. Participants self-administered etripamil NS if vagal maneuver was ineffective. After an episode of PSVT where study drug was administered, the participant returned to the investigative site and had the option to continue in NODE-303 and manage up to three subsequent episodes of PSVT with etripamil NS for a maximum of four episodes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events for Self-administered Etripamil NS Outside of the Clinical Setting.","timeFrame":"From Baseline until a maximum of 4 episodes of perceived PSVT are treated with study drug, up to a maximum duration of 40 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Etripamil","deltaMin":324,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":124,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Colombia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":503},"commonTop":["Nasal discomfort","Nasal congestion","Rhinorrhoea","Corona virus infection","Epistaxis"]}}
