In these populations, such treatment is associated with favorable objective response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival. These populations also have a relatively high incidence of somatic mutations in the region of the EGFR gene that encodes the tyrosine kinase domain.\n\nThe recent study(IPASS) by Tony S. Mok showed gefitinib was superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia . In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the EGFR gene mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel(HR= 0.48,P\\<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, PFS was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel(HR=2.85,P\\<0.001). Gefitinib treatment was well tolerated, with lower in hematologic toxicity, and no treatment-related interstitial lung disease.In this study(IPASS), only patients with a mutation of the EGFR gene in the tumor could get benefit from gefitinib as first line treatment.\n\nTony S. Mok and his colleague also found that intercalating and maintenance administration of erlotinib(another EGFR-TKI)following gemcitabine/platinum chemotherapy as first line therapy led to a significant improvement in PFS .","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival","timeFrame":"The evaluation of disease is demanded every two months for the patients receiving maintenance use of Gefitinib or patients in observation after chemotherapy,until disease progression occured","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Gefitinib+Gemcitabine +Carboplatin","deltaMin":9.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Gemcitabine +Carboplatin","deltaMin":4.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":109},"commonTop":["Diarrhea"]}}
