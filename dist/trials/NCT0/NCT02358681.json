However, IN ketorolac has been understudied in children, and it is not known how effective it is compared to IV ketorolac, which is currently the most common way of administering ketorolac to children. If IN ketorolac is shown to be no less effective than IV ketorolac, IN ketorolac may be a viable and painless alternative to effectively treat acute migraine headaches in children.\n\nTherefore, our primary aim is to demonstrate that IN ketorolac is non-inferior to IV ketorolac for reducing pain in children with acute migraine headaches.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Pain Score After Analgesic Administration (Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R)","timeFrame":"60 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ketorolac, Intranasal","deltaMin":4.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ketorolac, Intravenous","deltaMin":4.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["Other","Nausea","Dizziness","Sleepiness"]}}
