Participants also earned financial incentives for providing urine samples that tested negative for cocaine. Bupropion was examined for this purpose because of its previously demonstrated efficacy and safety as well as its pharmacological actions at dopamine systems. Participants were randomly assigned to bupropion XL vs. placebo and received different incentive schedules depending on whether they demonstrated abstinence from cocaine early in the study. Outcomes were tracked over a 6-month time frame and the overarching hypothesis was that bupropion (as compared to placebo) would increase the number of urine samples testing negative for cocaine, independent of whether participants demonstrated abstinence from cocaine early in the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Cocaine Negative Urines","timeFrame":"Weeks 7-30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo/Abstinence Initiation","deltaMin":70.6,"sd":0.01},{"arm":"Bupropion XL/Abstinence Initiation","deltaMin":57.7,"sd":0.01},{"arm":"Placebo/Relapse Prevention","deltaMin":4.2,"sd":0.01},{"arm":"Bupropion XL/Relapse Prevention","deltaMin":14.5,"sd":0.01}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.889"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36920397"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":31},"commonTop":["Headache","Depression","Abdominal Pain","Abdominal Cramps","Vomiting"]}}
