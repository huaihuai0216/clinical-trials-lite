The study includes 5 phases: A Screening Phase (up to 2 weeks), a Transition Phase (up to 2 weeks), an Open-Label Titration Phase (up to 10 weeks), a Double-Blind Treatment Phase including a Final Study Visit (12 weeks), and a Follow-up Phase (4 weeks). The overall duration of participation in the core phase of the study (randomized Double-Blind Phase) is up to 30 weeks, from the Screening Phase through the Follow-up Phase. Subjects who complete the Double-Blind Treatment Study Phase will be offered an opportunity to continue treatment in an open label safety extension for up to 60 weeks. Additional subjects may be recruited to open label safety extension to meet the goal of 100 subjects with 60 weeks of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of (Daily) Average Pain Intensity (WAAPI) and the Primary Timepoint Will be Week 12 of the Double-Blind Phase.","timeFrame":"12 weeks- from randomization baseline to 12 weeks after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CAM2038 (Buprenorphine FluidCrystal®) q1w and q4w","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":1.26},{"arm":"Placebo Subcutaneous Injections","deltaMin":2.4,"sd":1.25}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":69,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":468},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Injection site pruritus","Injection Site Erythema","Dizziness"]}}
