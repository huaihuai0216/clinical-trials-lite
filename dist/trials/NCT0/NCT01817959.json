The safety of Reparixin in the specific clinical setting was also evaluated.\n\nBackground: The chemokine CXCL8 plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in post-ischemia reperfusion injury after organ transplantation. Reparixin is the first low molecular weight blocker of CXCL8 biological activity in clinical development. Thus, the use of reparixin may emerge as a potential key component in the sequentially integrated approach to immunomodulation and control of non specific inflammatory events surrounding the early phases of pancreatic islet transplantation in T1D patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Serum C-peptide Level During the First 2 Hours of an MMTT (Mixed Meal Tolerance Test), Normalized by the Number of Islet Equivalent (IEQ)/kg","timeFrame":"Basal, -15' prior to meal, 15', 30', 60', 90', 120' following meal, Day 75±5 after the 1st islet infusion","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Reparixin Group","deltaMin":0.247,"sd":0.218},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":0.321,"sd":0.208}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9863"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Czechia","Italy","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39735417","33908301","32019854"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":29},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Abdominal pain","Vomiting","Diarrhoea"]}}
