The results could lead to significant changes in the approach to the early phase of type 1 diabetes with a strong emphasis on prolonging the honeymoon phase by using vitamin D and maintaining these patients on a standardized insulin regimen. The overall goal is to reduce the long-term complications of type 1 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Residual Beta-cell Function (RBCF)","timeFrame":"Baseline to 12 months at 3 months interval","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ergocalciferol","deltaMin":1.78,"sd":0.28},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.27,"sd":0.31}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":18},"commonTop":["upper respiratory infection","mild hair loss"]}}
