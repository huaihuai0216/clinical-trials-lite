Immune responses induced by the infant series (NeisVac-C® and Pentacel®)and toddler dose(NeisVac-C®)of routine pediatric vaccines when administered with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will be studied for noninferiority to the immune responses when administered with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Safety profile and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will also be evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects Achieving Predefined Antibody Level ≥1:8 for Meningococcal C Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA) in the 13vPnC Group Relative to 7vPnC Group After 2 Doses of NeisVac-C® in the Infant Series","timeFrame":"1 month after 2 doses of NeisVac-C® in the infant series (7 months of age)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC","deltaMin":96.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"7vPnC","deltaMin":99.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"42 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":300},"commonTop":["Irritability","Increased sleep","Irritability","Decreased appetite","Tenderness (any)"]}}
