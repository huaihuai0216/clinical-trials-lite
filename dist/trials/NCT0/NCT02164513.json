Published studies which assessed the use of an 'open' triple therapy (use of Inhaled Corticosteroid \\[ICS\\]/ Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists \\[LAMA\\])/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist \\[LABA\\] delivered via multiple inhalers) in moderate-severe COPD patients, reported improvements in lung function, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), hospitalization rates and rescue medication use, compared to dual therapy (ICS/LABA) or LAMA alone. These studies have also shown similar safety profile with dual or monotherapy doses for periods of up to one year. Given the clinical experience with FF, UMEC and VI, and that the associated risks with these compounds are anticipated from their known pharmacology, the potential benefit of a new therapy option in patients with moderate to severe COPD supports the further development of the closed triple combination (delivered via one inhaler). In the current study subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will complete 2-week run-in period; 52 week treatment period and a 1-week safety follow-up period. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the following double-blind treatment groups FF/UMEC/VI 100 micrograms (mcg)/62.5 mcg/25 mcg once daily (QD), FF/VI 100 mcg/25 mcg QD, or UMEC/VI 62.5 mcg/25 mcg QD","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annual Rate of On-treatment Moderate/Severe Exacerbations Comparing FF/UMEC/VI With UMEC/VI and FF/VI","timeFrame":"Up to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FF/UMEC/VI","deltaMin":0.91,"sd":null},{"arm":"FF/VI","deltaMin":1.07,"sd":null},{"arm":"UMEC/VI","deltaMin":1.21,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":998,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","Colombia","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Israel","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Peru","Philippines","Poland","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom","Vietnam"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38844004","38446336","37012070","36470149","36102236","35970518","34972260","34385263","33910578","33201438","33156982","33124900","33121372","33031829","32647911","32584168","32503599","32436683","32299860","32162970","31819401","31321713","31281061","29668352","27418551"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":895,"n":4151},"commonTop":["Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Back pain","Oral candidiasis"]}}
