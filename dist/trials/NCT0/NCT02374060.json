The primary efficacy measure will be percent change in central subfield thickness as measured by OCT at 8 weeks. Participants will continue in the study for 24 weeks in order to evaluate relative effects of the 3 treatment strategies on the duration of treatment effects, requirement for additional injections, and adverse effects.\n\nNote: The planned sample size for the POINT Trial was 267 subjects. On 17 July 2017, with 192 subjects enrolled, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) reviewed the planned interim analysis and recommended that the goals of the trial could be accomplished by completing follow-up of enrolled subjects without the recruitment of additional subjects. Per the DSMC recommendations, recruitment was suspended and follow-up of enrolled subjects was completed according to the protocol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Baseline Central Subfield Thickness Observed at 8 Weeks","timeFrame":"At baseline and 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Periocular Triamcinolone 40mg","deltaMin":0.77,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intravitreal Triamcinolone 4mg","deltaMin":0.61,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dexamethasoneintravitreal Implant","deltaMin":0.54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30269924"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":65},"commonTop":[]}}
