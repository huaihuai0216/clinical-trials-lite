In addition, the study will evaluate select technical attributes of the interventions as well as the effect of these two interventions on other lower urinary tract and pelvic floor symptoms.\n\nHypothesis: InterStim® therapy will result in a greater reduction in daily urge urinary incontinence episodes over the 6-month follow-up period as compared to Botox A® injection.\n\nA supplemental study investigates whether biological markers including those related to inflammation and connective tissue remodeling change following treatments with Botox A® and Interstim®.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Episodes","timeFrame":"6 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"InterStim® Device","deltaMin":-3.25,"sd":null},{"arm":"Botox® Injection","deltaMin":-3.89,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33620895","31895722","31211964","29031894","24486637"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":58,"n":178},"commonTop":["Urinary Tract Infection"]}}
