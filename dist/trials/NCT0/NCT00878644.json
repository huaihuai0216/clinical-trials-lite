Therapeutic hypothermia, in which the body's temperature is lowered and maintained several degrees below normal for a period of time, has been used to successfully treat adults who have experienced cardiac arrest. This study will evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia at increasing survival rates and reducing the risk of brain injury in infants and children who experience a cardiac arrest while out of the hospital.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Survival With Good Neurobehavioral Outcome","timeFrame":"Survival was assessed at one-year anniversary of cardiac arrest; among survivors at this one-year anniversary, the VABS-II valid assessment window ranged from 30 days prior to until 183 days after the one-year anniversary date.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Therapeutic Hypothermia","deltaMin":27,"sd":null},{"arm":"Therapeutic Normothermia","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.14"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"48 Hours","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19451846","19455024","20935561","25913022","38320098","38320013","30922934","30572071","29884735","27737774","26940987","25268768","23842585","23295834"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":98,"n":153},"commonTop":["Hypotension","Hypokalemia","Anemia","Diabetes insipidus","Seizure"]}}
