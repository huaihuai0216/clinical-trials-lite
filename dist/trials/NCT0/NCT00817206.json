Patients on a stable dose of Prograf® will be randomly assigned to be converted from Prograf® twice daily to LCP Tacro™ once daily or to remain on maintenance therapy with Prograf® twice daily. Patients entering the study will be treated with assigned study drug and followed for one year for patient survival and the incidence of graft rejection or graft loss.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Composite Endpoint for Efficacy Failure Within 12 Months of Randomization: Death, Graft Failure, Biopsy-proven Acute Rejection or Loss to Follow-up.","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LCP-Tacro","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prograf (Tacrolimus)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":162},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Urinary tract infection","Blood creatinine increased","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
