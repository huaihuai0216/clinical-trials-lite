Unfortunately, there are no current treatments that have been shown to improve cognitive skills among individuals with bipolar disorder.\n\nComputerized cognitive remediation (CR) is a treatment that has been shown to improve cognitive skills among individuals with serious mental illnesses other than bipolar disorder, such as schizophrenia. This treatment involves completing a series of activities on a computer that have been shown to improve cognitive skills.\n\nD-cycloserine (DCS) is an antibiotic traditionally used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Recent studies have suggested that this drug may also improve individuals' ability to learn. Thus, the goal of our study is to examine whether receipt of d-cycloserine increases the benefit that individuals receive from participation in cognitive remediation.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, approximately forty subjects will be randomized to one of two study arms: \\[i\\] CR + DCS or \\[ii\\] CR + placebo. We will examine whether d-cycloserine increases the benefit that individuals with bipolar disorder receive from participation in cognitive remediation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Cognitive Functioning","timeFrame":"26 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CR + DCS","deltaMin":10.9,"sd":22.02},{"arm":"CR + Placebo","deltaMin":7.12,"sd":8.72}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25566387"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
