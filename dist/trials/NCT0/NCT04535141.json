Subjects will either be given olanzapine or an inactive pill (called a placebo) before getting any chemotherapy that is known to cause nausea and vomiting. During the study, the study coordinators will ask the subjects to complete surveys to understand if the patient is having nausea and vomiting, and if so, how bad it is making the patient feel.\n\nThis trial will split subjects into two groups: one group will be given an inactive pill (placebo), and the other group will be given the active pill (olanzapine). Study coordinators will collect surveys every morning before chemotherapy and 5 days after the last dose of chemotherapy. These surveys may be given by members of the study team or possibly on a mobile device.\n\nSubjects may benefit from being in this research study because olanzapine may reduce the frequency or severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The most common risks of using olanzapine include possibly becoming more tired, mild dizziness, mild low blood pressure, and mild muscle \"quivering.\" Other possible adverse effects include low blood pressure, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight gain, constipation, and liver function test changes however these risks are less common in subjects with cancer. In addition, there may be a change detected in heart rhythm however subjects will be screened for this ahead of time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Complete Response","timeFrame":"End of study assessment period, until 5 days after last chemotherapy administration (2- 12 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Olanzapine","deltaMin":21,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31635549","27410922","28759346","28694084","27050207","29906570","30204536"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":46},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Constipation","Activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged","hyperglycemia","Headache"]}}
