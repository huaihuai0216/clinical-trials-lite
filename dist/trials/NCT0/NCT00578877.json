At two sites, a substudy involving colposcopy and microflora will be conducted in about 80 women (40 at each site). The primary objective of this study is to estimate the cumulative 6-month typical-use pregnancy probability for women using the SILCS diaphragm with a contraceptive gel.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Probability of Pregnancy Among Users of the SILCS Diaphragm Used With Contraceptive Gel Over 6 Months of Typical Use","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"N-9 Gel With SILCS Diaphragm","deltaMin":12.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"BufferGel With SILCS Diaphragm","deltaMin":9.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":17,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25751199"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":137},"commonTop":["Pain, irritation, pruritus","Abnormal vaginal bleeding","Symptomatic vaginal infection"]}}
