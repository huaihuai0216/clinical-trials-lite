Separately, the study will also describe the safety and immunogenicity of frozen-liquid BNT162b2 with lipid nanoparticle size at the upper end of specification and ready to use BNT162b2 (the immediate manufacturing precursor to the lyophilate). Additionally, the study will describe the safety and immunogenicity of an additional dose of frozen liquid BNT162b2 to participants who already received the 2-dose schedule of lyophilized BNT162b2.\n\n* 2-dose schedule (separated by 21 days)\n* At a dose of 30Âµg (as studied in the Phase 2/3 study C4591001)\n* In healthy adults 18 through 55 years of age\n* The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 2 months (3 visits in total)\n* The study will be conducted in the United States","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Full-Length S-Binding IgG Concentrations of Lyophilized Formulation SDVs and Frozen-Liquid Formulation in MDVs 1 Month After Dose 2","timeFrame":"1 Month after Dose 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BNT162b2 Lyophilized SDV: Part 1","deltaMin":4796.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"BNT162b2 Frozen-Liquid MDV: Part 1","deltaMin":7031.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=C4591020"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":279},"commonTop":["Injection site pain (PAIN)","Fatigue (FATIGUE)","Headache (HEADACHE)","Myalgia (MUSCLE PAIN)","Chills (CHILLS)"]}}
