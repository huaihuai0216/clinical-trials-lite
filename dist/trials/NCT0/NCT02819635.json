The objective of Substudy 1 was to characterize the dose-response, efficacy, and safety of upadacitinib compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission to identify the induction dose of upadacitinib for further evaluation in Substudy 2. The objective of Substudy 2 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission in participants. The objective of Substudy 3 was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib compared to placebo in achieving clinical remission in participants who had a response following induction with upadacitinib.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Substudy 1: Percentage Of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission Per Adapted Mayo Score at Week 8","timeFrame":"At Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SS1: Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"SS1: Upadacitinib 7.5 mg","deltaMin":8.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"SS1: Upadacitinib 15 mg","deltaMin":14.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"SS1: Upadacitinib 30 mg","deltaMin":13.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"SS1: Upadacitinib 45 mg","deltaMin":21.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.049"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.010"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.007"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":496,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belarus","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Lithuania","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40875187","40488552","38010661","37942921","37683686","37490069","37296268","36790041","36645051","36571701","36464141","35644166","32092309"],"seeAlso":["https://www.rxabbvie.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":46},"commonTop":["COLITIS ULCERATIVE","NASOPHARYNGITIS","HEADACHE","BLOOD CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE INCREASED","ARTHRALGIA"]}}
