The main objective of Period 1 is to compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) and 30 mg QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab (Humira速) in participants with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who have had an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression.\n\nThe objective of Period 2 is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD in participants who have completed Period 1.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response at Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":36.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adalimumab 40 mg","deltaMin":65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Upadacitinib 15 mg","deltaMin":70.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Upadacitinib 30 mg","deltaMin":78.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":345,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belarus","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","China","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Lithuania","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","Slovakia","Slovenia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (T端rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40875187","38683479","38331400","37982966","37945286","37038159","36754548","36243812","35606663","34970731","34864911","34636026","34464029","33789011"],"seeAlso":["https://www.rxabbvie.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":423},"commonTop":["UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","BLOOD CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE INCREASED","NASOPHARYNGITIS","ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE INCREASED","URINARY TRACT INFECTION"]}}
