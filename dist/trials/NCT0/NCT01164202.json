Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether chemoembolization is more effective with or without sunitinib malate in treating patients with liver cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying the side effects of chemoembolization of the liver and to see how well in works when given together with or without sunitinib malate in treating patients with liver cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With Occurrence of Severe Bleeding and/or Liver Failure","timeFrame":"Up to 7 days following each TACE, up to 5 months of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":5.88,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sunitinib","deltaMin":2.78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":31,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32576496"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":39},"commonTop":["ASAT","ALAT","Bilirubine","Platelets","Neutrophiles"]}}
