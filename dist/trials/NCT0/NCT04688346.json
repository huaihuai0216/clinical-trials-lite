Thirteen patients requiring prefabricated zirconia crowns on both primary maxillary first molars were recruited into a split-mouth randomized controlled pilot study. Patients received a continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil with inhaled nitrous oxide/oxygen. After patient randomization and tooth preparation, either saline pellets (control) or racemic epinephrine pellets (treatment) were applied directly to gingival tissue. Vital sign measurements were recorded for 5 minutes. The procedure was repeated with either control or treatment on the contralateral side.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cardiovascular Outcomes","timeFrame":"5 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":91.5,"sd":18.2},{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":93.4,"sd":15.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
