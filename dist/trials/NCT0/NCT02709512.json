Malignant pleural mesothelioma have been found to require arginine, an amino acid. Thus the hypothesis is that by restricting arginine with ADI-PEG 20, the malignant pleural mesothelioma cells will starve and die.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Response Rate","timeFrame":"approximately 18 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Drug: ADI-PEG 20 Plus Pem Platinum","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Drug: Placebo Plus Pem Platinum","deltaMin":12,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9489"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":45,"countries":["United States","Australia","Italy","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38358753","34589965","33358660"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":125},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fatigue","Constipation","Anemia","Decreased Appetite"]}}
