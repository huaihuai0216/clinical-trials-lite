Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with direct and immune-mediated mechanisms of action, as well as clinical activity in NHL. Recent studies in frontline and relapsed/refractory NHL show high activity for lenalidomide plus rituximab (R2), supporting further study of this combination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"From the first dose date of maintenance therapy to objective disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 432 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Lenalidomide + Rituximab","deltaMin":263.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Rituximab","deltaMin":229.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3296"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":126,"countries":["United States","Germany","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30897038","30919940"],"seeAlso":["https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/clinical-trials-and-research.html","http://www.BMSClinicalTrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":172,"n":500},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Fatigue","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Cough"]}}
