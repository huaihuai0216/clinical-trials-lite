Subjects with 2 treatment areas (bilateral buttocks) with moderate or severe levels of cellulite as independently assessed by the subject using the Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS) and by the Investigator using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) will be eligible. The eligibility of the buttocks will be confirmed on Day 1. Once the eligibility of the buttocks is confirmed, subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (EN3835 0.84 mg per buttock or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio within an investigational site. Each subject will receive a treatment course which consists of up to 3 treatment visits (sessions), separated by 21 days (ie, Days 1, 22, and 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection or placebo; 0.84 mg in 3.6 mL per buttock) in each of the two buttocks for a total volume of 7.2 mL (1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treated in the buttocks will be at the discretion of the Investigator. End of study will occur at study day 71.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"2-level Composite Responders for the Target Buttock","timeFrame":"Day 71","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH)","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33840781"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":214},"commonTop":["Injection site bruising","Injection site pain","Injection site nodule","Injection site erythema","Injection site pruritus"]}}
