Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan are more effective than docetaxel and prednisone in treating prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan to see how well they work compared to docetaxel and prednisone in treating patients with stage IV prostate cancer and bone metastases that did not respond to previous hormone therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Compare Survival Between a Control or Standard Therapy Arm of Docetaxel + Placebo + Prednisone With Docetaxel + Atrasentan + Prednisone in Patients With Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer.","timeFrame":"Up to 7 years after study opens","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I: Placebo","deltaMin":17.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II: Atrasentan","deltaMin":17.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.64"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":554,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24616308","24565955","23871417"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":172,"n":486},"commonTop":["Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Hemoglobin","Edema: limb","Neuropathy: sensory","Glucose, serum-high (hyperglycemia)"]}}
