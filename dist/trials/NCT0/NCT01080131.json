The efficacy of canakinumab was compared to the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide.\n\nThe purpose of the first 12 week extension study was to collect additional safety, tolerability and efficacy data in patients who have completed the core study CACZ885H2357.\n\nThe purpose of the second one year open-label extension study was to confirm the long-term safety and tolerability of canakinumab in patients who had completed the first extension study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First New Flare: Survival Analysis During the 12 Weeks of Study","timeFrame":"Baseline to 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Canakinumab 150 mg","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Triamcinolone Acetonide 40 mg","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":108,"countries":["United States","Canada","China","Netherlands","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24122883"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":112},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Arthralgia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Back pain","Headache"]}}
