Both diseases are progressive degenerating diseases that cause difficulties in breathing, airway protection and swallowing. Patients with PD and MS typically become sedentary and lose endurance, maximal fitness levels and overall pulmonary function. Much of the research focus has been on the motor symptoms of PD and MS yet the pulmonary and swallowing complications are perhaps ultimately the most important disability as the diseases progress. The inability to generate adequate respiratory pressure is responsible for reduced cough magnitudes and cough response times. Cough is critical for the clearance of foreign materials in the airway helping to reduce infiltration of bacteria and subsequent respiratory infection. With reduced cough function an increased risk for pulmonary disease occurs due to a reduced ability to protect the airways. There are a number of promising outcomes from an expiratory strength-training program. By increasing expiratory muscle strength and expiratory pressure generation, effective breathing, clearance of the airway, and improved swallowing can occur. These explicit outcomes are predicted based on our experience with the use of an innovative device-driven, home-based expiratory strength training program focused on the expiratory muscles of respiration. This project focuses on following patients with PD and MS for an initial 5 weeks of strength training and them testing the outcome of a caregiver program for maintaining treatment effects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP)","timeFrame":"at baseline and again after 5-week EMST exercise","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: EMST","deltaMin":78.6,"sd":30.72},{"arm":"Arm 2: Sham","deltaMin":75.56,"sd":27.68}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.899"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.946"},{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.00042"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.0019"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":[]}}
