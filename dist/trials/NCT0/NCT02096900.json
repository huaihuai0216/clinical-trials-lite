Subjects will be randomized to receive oral medication midazolam or zolpidem approximately 30 minutes prior to surgery. No placebo will be administered in this study. Subjects will be male and female children between 2 and 9 years of age. In total, subject participation will last approximately the duration of their preoperative, perioperative, and immediate postoperative period. A member of the research team will recruit subjects preoperatively in the operating room holding area prior to surgery. Consent will take place at the time of recruitment in the preoperative holding area following a detailed explanation of the study and medications involved in the study. Participants will be of ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class I-II, undergoing surgical procedures of at least 2 hours duration, and expected to remain inpatient for at least 23 hours postoperatively.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patient Anxiety at the Time of Separation","timeFrame":"Up to 24 hours including preoperative, preoperative, and postoperative periods.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Midazolam","deltaMin":26.69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Zolpidem","deltaMin":30,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Double vision","Visual Hallucinations","Oxygen desatruation","Epigastric pain","Involuntary tongue movements"]}}
