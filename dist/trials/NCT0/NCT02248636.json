Half of the group will receive the same treatment they were taking before the study -- this is called the \"sham discontinuation\" arm. The other half will receive a reduced dose of their medication, and then an inactive pill (placebo) -- this is called the \"real discontinuation\" arm.\n\nParticipants will be able to return to their previous dose of medication at any time during the study. The percentage of people who return will be measured and compared. Other medical events and factors such as behaviors, thinking, and caregiver distress, will be measured and compared between the groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Successful Completion","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Real Discontinuation","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sham Discontinuation","deltaMin":32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":26},"commonTop":["Behavior"]}}
