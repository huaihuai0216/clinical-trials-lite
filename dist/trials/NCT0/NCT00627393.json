The severely reduced immunity of those with neutropenia can put them at risk of entry of life-threatening infections, making the implementation of treatments that increase white blood cell numbers important. Several studies have shown that the transfusion of donor granulocytes, a type of white blood cell that includes neutrophils, is effective in promoting the recovery of adequate numbers of granulocytes. However, granulocyte transfusions can cause side effects, and it is not known whether the success of the therapy outweighs the health risks of the side effects. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of granulocyte transfusions in treating people with a bacterial or fungal infection during neutropenia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Are Alive at 42 Days After Treatment and Have Had Microbial Response","timeFrame":"Measured at Day 42","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control Arm","deltaMin":42.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Granulocyte Arm","deltaMin":41.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.73"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26333778"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":58},"commonTop":["Fever","Sinus tachycardia","Rigors and Chills","Hypertension","Hypotension"]}}
