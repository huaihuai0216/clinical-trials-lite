Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may be a potential new treatment option for MPS IVA patients. BMN 110 is administered to MPS IVA patients by IV infusion, allowing cellular uptake by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor and transportation to the lysosomes.\n\nThis enzyme uptake into the lysosomes is hypothesized to promote increased catabolism of keratan sulfate (KS) in tissue macrophages, hyaline cartilage, other connective tissues, and heart valve, and reduce the progressive accumulation of KS which is responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disorders.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Endurance as Measured by the 6-minute Walk Test","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":211.9,"sd":69.88},{"arm":"BMN110 2.0 mg/kg/Qow","deltaMin":205.7,"sd":81.19},{"arm":"BMN110 2.0 mg/kg/Week","deltaMin":203.9,"sd":76.32}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0174"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9542"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Colombia","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Portugal","Qatar","Saudi Arabia","South Korea","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25487082"],"seeAlso":["http://www.bmrn.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":59},"commonTop":["Headache","Vomiting","Pyrexia","Cough","Nausea"]}}
