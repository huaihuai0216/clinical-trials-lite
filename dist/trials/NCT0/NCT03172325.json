Patients with the diagnosis of active Rheumatoid arthritis according to EULAR criteria (European League Against Rheumatism) aged between 18 to 75 years will be included. This study is a Phase III, randomized, two arms, double-blind (patient and assessor blinded), parallel active-controlled non-inferiority clinical trial. The eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive CinnoRA® or Humira®. Every two weeks, 40 mg of either of the drugs will be administered to each patient subcutaneously along with methotrexate (15 mg/week), folic acid (1 mg/day), and prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) over six months.\n\nThe primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of test- adalimumab (CinnoRA®) and the reference adalimumab (Humira®) in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis regarding the evaluation of EULAR criteria based on Disease activity score (DAS).\n\nThe secondary objectives of this study are:\n\n* To further compare the efficacy of test- adalimumab to reference adalimumab\n* To assess the safety of test- adalimumab compared to reference adalimumab","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With DAS28-EULAR Good and Moderate Responses at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CinnaGen Adalimumab","deltaMin":63,"sd":null},{"arm":"AbbVie Adalimumab","deltaMin":63,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["Iran"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22150039","12415583","22473917","15146409","14719195","12528101","7779114","11961039","17045630","24991562","23169319","19273451","25539805","9205564","14584021","28728599"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":68},"commonTop":["Injection site reaction","Respiratory infection","Headache","Flu-like symptoms","Nausea"]}}
