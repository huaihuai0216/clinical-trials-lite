Approximately 160 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 100 mg SC mepolizumab or placebo SC. The study will include a 4-week run-in period followed by randomization to a 52-week treatment period, where participants will be administered 4-weekly doses of mepolizumab or placebo via a pre-filled safety syringe device (SSD) injection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Total Endoscopic Nasal Polyps (NP) Score at Week 52 - ITT Population Excluding Medipharma Managed Sites","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 1) up to week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mepolizumab","deltaMin":-0.62,"sd":0.164},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.19,"sd":0.164}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.067"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":38},"locations":{"siteCount":61,"countries":["China","Japan","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39058315"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":84},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Immunisation reaction","Back pain"]}}
