The combined reduced-antigen-content diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccine was planned to be used as an active control for safety and reactogenicity evaluation.\n\nFollowing a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee of NCT04605159 (RSV MAT 009), GSK made the decision to stop enrolment and vaccination in this study. Enrolled study participants were monitored as part of the study until study completion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Reporting Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"During the entire study period (from Day 1 up to Day 181)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RSV_dTpa-P Group","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"RSV_dTpa-A Group","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"dTpa_RSV-A Group","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1},"commonTop":["Administration site pain","Diarrhoea","Headache","Fatigue","Administration site erythema"]}}
