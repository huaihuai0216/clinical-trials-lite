This definition aims to avoid bias by comparison of treatment effects in the subject's assessments. Furthermore, this study will substantiate the existing efficacy and safety database for the indication BEB.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Double-blind MP: Change From Baseline in JRS Severity Subscore at Day 43 (Visit 4)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Day 43 (Visit 4)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double-blind MP: Placebo","deltaMin":-0.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-blind MP: IncobotulinumtoxinA 25 Units","deltaMin":-1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-blind MP: IncobotulinumtoxinA 50 Units","deltaMin":-1.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"=0.0004"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.1452"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["Greece","Malaysia","Sri Lanka"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34384301","33211907","32779096"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["Eyelid ptosis","Dry eye","Eye pruritus","Eyelid function disorder","Back pain"]}}
