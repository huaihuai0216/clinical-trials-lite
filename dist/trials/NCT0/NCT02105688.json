The purpose of Part A is to assess the efficacy and safety of grazoprevir (MK-5172) 100 mg in combination with elbasvir (MK-8742) 50 mg for 12 weeks in the treatment of chronic HCV GT1, GT4, or GT6 infection in treatment-naïve participants who are on opiate substitution therapy (OST). The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants who receive grazoprevir/elbasvir fixed-dose combination (FDC) in the Immediate Treatment Arm and achieve a Sustained Virologic Response 12 weeks after the end of all study therapy (SVR12) will be superior to 67%. In addition, participants who received at least 1 dose of grazoprevir/elbasvir in Part A will be eligible to participate in Part B, which is a 3-year observational follow-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks After the End of All Study Therapy (SVR12)","timeFrame":"12 weeks after end of all therapy (Study Week 24 for Immediate Treatment Arm and Study Week 40 for Deferred Treatment Arm)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Treatment Arm: Grazoprevir/Elbasvir","deltaMin":95.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Deferred Treatment Arm: Placebo > Grazoprevir/Elbasvir","deltaMin":96.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["27537841","35939812","29461687","29404492"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":201},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Headache","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Constipation"]}}
