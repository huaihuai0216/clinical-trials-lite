These findings will motivate the development of future clinical studies that incorporate knowledge about pain processing and movement strategies in patients with tendinopathy. Participants with achilles tendinopathy will receive an anesthetic injection to the achilles tendon in order to examine how reduced pain, detected by the peripheral nervous system, alters task performance and perception of pain. We hypothesize that there are factors within the central nervous system that contribute to continued pain and disability in patients with chronic AT.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Central Sensitization","timeFrame":"Within session, baseline and 30 minutes after an anesthetic injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group With Achilles Tendinopathy","deltaMin":463.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group Without Achilles Tendinopathy","deltaMin":383.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.44"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.08"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["Increased soreness"]}}
