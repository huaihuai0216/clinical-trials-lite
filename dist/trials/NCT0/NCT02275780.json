Participants will receive double-blind treatment during the 96-week Base Study. Eligible participants in either of the Base Study groups will continue to receive the doravirine-containing regimen open label for an additional 96 weeks in the Study Extension 1. Eligible participants who are deriving benefit will continue in Study Extension 2 to receive the doravirine-containing regimen open label until doravirine becomes locally available or for an additional 96 weeks, whichever comes first. The primary hypothesis is that doravirine 100 mg once a day (q.d.) is non-inferior to darunavir/ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d., each in combination with TRUVADA™ or EPZICOM™/KIVEXA™, as assessed by the proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\<50 copies/mL at Week 48. If non-inferiority is established, then the superiority of doravirine 100 mg q.d. compared to darunavir/ ritonavir (800 mg/100 mg) q.d. will be assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Doravirine 100 mg","deltaMin":83.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Daurunavir 800 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg","deltaMin":79.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["40672760","39748155","38141637","31740348","31121015","31121013","29592840"],"seeAlso":["http://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26091&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":45,"n":383},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
