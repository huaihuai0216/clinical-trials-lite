All three of these fluids are in common clinical use for this purpose. As large volumes of NS may result in a dilutional acidosis and an increasing base deficit, it may cloud clinical decision making when resuscitative efforts are guided by acid-base status on routine arterial blood gas analysis. This is a prospective, randomized study to evaluate changes in acid-base and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, calcium) status with the use of various isotonic fluids for intraoperative resuscitation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Base Deficit","timeFrame":"During surgery (typically 4-6 hrs in length)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Normal Saline","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":2.4},{"arm":"Lactated Ringers","deltaMin":-1.2,"sd":2.3},{"arm":"Normosol-R","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":1.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
