There are no studies of treatment of high triglycerides in children and adolescents. Fish oil is attractive because it is considered safe and effective for treating high triglycerides in adults and has been used safely for other purposes in children. The investigators will conduct a randomized study of Lovaza (the only prescription omega-3 fish oil medication) in 44 children and adolescents to study efficacy in lowering triglycerides, safety, and possible mechanisms of beneficial effects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Triglyceride Level","timeFrame":"after 8 week treatment or placebo period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Omega-3-acid Ethyl Esters (Lovaza)","deltaMin":-52,"sd":16},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-16,"sd":15}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
