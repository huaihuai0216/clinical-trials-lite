This research study consists of a screening, open-label, and double-blind treatment withdrawal phase. The screening phase ensures the patient eligibility. No study medication is dispensed during the screening phase. During the open-label phase, patients are administered esomeprazole 2.5mg, 5.0mg or 10.0mg based on his/her weight. During the double-blind phase, the patients are administered either his/her open-label dose or placebo. Double-blind means neither the physician, parent, or patient will know if patient is taking esomeprazole or placebo. The patient will have an equal chance of receiving esomeprazole or placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Discontinuing Due to Symptom Worsening in the Randomized Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Treatment Withdrawal Phase Endpoint)","timeFrame":"Treatment-withdrawal phase (up to 4 weeks following randomization, or until earlier discontinuation from the study)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double Blind Esomeprazole","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double Blind Placebo","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Month","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26422097","26121349","22241513"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=440&filename=CSR-D9614C00096.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=440&filename=CSR-D9614C00096.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":98},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Pyrexia","Cough","Rhinitis","Bronchitis"]}}
