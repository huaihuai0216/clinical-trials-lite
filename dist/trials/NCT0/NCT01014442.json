Participants will be split into 2 groups according to the original disease: Group A (cystic fibrosis) and Group B (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\[COPD\\], emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency \\[A1AD\\]). All participants will receive mycophenolate mofetil orally, 1.5 grams (g) twice daily (BID) from Day 2 to 30 post transplantation, and 1 g BID from Day 31 to 90 post transplantation. Anticipated time on study treatment is 90 days, and target sample size is 50-100 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Mycophenolic Acid (MPA), Mycophenolic Acid Glucuronide (MPAG) and Acyl Glucuronide Metabolite of Mycophenolic Acid (AcMPAG) at Day 4","timeFrame":"Predose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-dose on Day 4 after transplantation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MMF - Cystic Fibrosis","deltaMin":7.914,"sd":5.4645},{"arm":"MMF - COPD, Emphysema, IPF, or A1AD","deltaMin":5.608,"sd":2.5591}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2649"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3113"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2953"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":33},"commonTop":["Atrial fibrillation","Anaemia","Leukopenia","Fibrinous bronchitis","Nausea"]}}
