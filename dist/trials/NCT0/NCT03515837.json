This study will be considered to have met its success criteria if the combination of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to saline placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of PFS or OS.\n\nUpon study completion, participants are discontinued and may be enrolled in a pembrolizumab extension study, if available.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)","timeFrame":"Up to ~40 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembro + Pemetrexed + Chemo","deltaMin":5.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Pemetrexed + Chemo","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0122"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":158,"countries":["United States","Australia","Brazil","Canada","China","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39173098"],"seeAlso":["https://merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26126&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":86,"n":245},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Nausea","Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell count decreased","Constipation"]}}
