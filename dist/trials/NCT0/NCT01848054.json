The hypothesis is that starting directly on OX219 works equally well (e.g. not significantly worse) as starting on buprenorphine only and switching to OX219 on Day 3.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Retention in Treatment in the Per Protocol Population","timeFrame":"Day 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BNX Sublingual Tablets Induction","deltaMin":113,"sd":null},{"arm":"Buprenorphine Induction","deltaMin":122,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":155},"commonTop":["Nausea (Induction)","Headache (Induction)","Insomnia (Induction)","Vomiting (Induction)"]}}
