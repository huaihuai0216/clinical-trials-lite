The study will also assess whether it is reasonable to continue with further study of minocycline in HD. We will measure the effect of minocycline on HD by measuring the change in Huntington's disease symptoms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Month 18 in the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) Scale [LOCF Imputation Method]","timeFrame":"Baseline to 18 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Minocycline 100 mg Twice Daily","deltaMin":1.55,"sd":1.85},{"arm":"Matching Placebo Twice Daily","deltaMin":1.15,"sd":1.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15304592"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":87},"commonTop":["Fall","Balance disorder","Depression","Insomnia","Diarrhea"]}}
