Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Giving chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether treatment with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating patients who have undergone surgery for colon cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-free Survival","timeFrame":"3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Oxaliplatin + Leucovorin + 5-Fluorouracil","deltaMin":75.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Oxaliplatin + Leucovorin + 5-Fluorouracil + Bevacizumab","deltaMin":77.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":16,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38315963","33356421","31811950","31268130","28006055","23233715","21997132"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":81,"n":1326},"commonTop":["Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Neutrophil count decreased","Diarrhea","Fatigue","Hypertension"]}}
