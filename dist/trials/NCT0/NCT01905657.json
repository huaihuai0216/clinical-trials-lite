Participants were assigned randomly to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg once every three weeks (Q3W), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W or docetaxel 75 mg/m\\^2 Q3W. The total number of participants randomized depended upon demonstration of sufficient objective responses at an interim analysis.\n\nEligible participants who were allocated to the first course of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to receive a second course of pembrolizumab as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.\n\nProtocol Amendment 12 (effective date: 09 Dec 2015) enabled eligible participants who were allocated to docetaxel and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to switch over to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.\n\nWith Protocol Amendment 15 (effective date: 03 Jan 2018), all second course and switch over participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Response or progression during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards efficacy outcome measures, and adverse events during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards safety outcome measures.\n\nAlso with Amendment 15, once a participant has achieved the study objective or the study has ended, the participant will be discontinued from this study and enrolled in an extension study (Keynote 587; NCT03486873) to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment. Switch over participants who have not transitioned to pembrolizumab will be considered for the extension study on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe primary study hypotheses are that pembolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by independent radiologists' review in previously-treated participants with NSCLC in the strongly positive programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) stratum compared to docetaxel and in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 compared to docetaxel.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Through pre-specified database cutoff date of 30 Sep 2015 (Up to approximately 24 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg","deltaMin":14.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg","deltaMin":17.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Docetaxel 75 mg/m^2","deltaMin":8.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.00024"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.00002"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.00076"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.00001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26712084","35101941","33439727","32305010","32078391","31395089","30711649","30657853"],"seeAlso":["http://merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":124,"n":339},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Decreased appetite","Nausea","Dyspnoea","Cough"]}}
