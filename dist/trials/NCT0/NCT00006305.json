Primary Aim\n\nThe primary aim of the BARI 2D trial is to test the following two hypotheses of treatment efficacy in 2400 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and documented stable CAD, in the setting of uniform glycemic control and intensive management of all other risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, and obesity:\n\n1. Coronary Revascularization Hypothesis: a strategy of initial elective revascularization of choice (surgical or catheter-based) combined with aggressive medical therapy results in lower 5-year mortality compared to a strategy of aggressive medical therapy alone;\n2. Method of Glycemic Control Hypothesis: with a target HbA1c level of less than 7.0%, a strategy of hyperglycemia management directed at insulin sensitization results in lower 5-year mortality compared to a strategy of insulin provision.\n\nB. Secondary Aims\n\nThe secondary aims of the BARI 2D trial include: a) comparing the death, myocardial infarction or stroke combined endpoint event rate between the revascularization versus medical therapy groups and between the insulin sensitization versus insulin provision groups; b) comparing rates of myocardial infarction, other ischemic events, angina and quality of life associated with each revascularization and hyperglycemia management strategy; c) evaluating the relative economic costs associated with the trial treatment strategies, d) exploring the effect of glycemic control strategy on the progression and mechanism of vasculopathy including changes in PAI-1 gene expression.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With All-Cause Mortality","timeFrame":"five years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Revascularization and Insulin Providing (IP)","deltaMin":80,"sd":null},{"arm":"Revascularization and Insulin Sensitizing (IS)","deltaMin":75,"sd":null},{"arm":"Medical Therapy and Insulin Providing (IP)","deltaMin":80,"sd":null},{"arm":"Medical Therapy and Insulin Sensitizing (IS)","deltaMin":81,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.97"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.89"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["12566379","16813734","18760137","19502645","20937978","20584997","20375690","20626665","20147671","20152229","19875998","19920002","19920001","19463459","19231325","16464721","16813735","16813736","16813738","16813739","20042560","20102884","19576321","19228864","19335534","19301686","16813733","16813737","31590967","30286920","28903941","28126156","27289411","26853953","26271057","26267622","24178969","23910429","23857320","23757426","23735723","23500281","23500245","23410541","23008442","22496082","21911782","21835316","21768545","21742107","21473976","21444887"],"seeAlso":["http://www.bari2d.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":230,"n":592},"commonTop":["Pitting Edema","Lower Extremity Ulcer","Laser Therapy for Macular Edema","Bone Fracture"]}}
