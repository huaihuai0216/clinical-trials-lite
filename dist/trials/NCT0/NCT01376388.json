The product will be delivered via the Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (nDPI) over 52 weeks to Japanese subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This is a multi-centre, open-label study evaluating the safety of GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder 125/25 mcg. Treatment will be given once-daily in the morning. The target enrolment is approximately 120 subjects at approximately 20 study centres in Japan. The total duration of subject participation will be 54-55 weeks, consisting of a 7-14 day run-in period, 52-week treatment period and 1-week follow-up period. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at screening visit (Visit 1) will enter 7-14 day run-in period. The run-in period is provided for completion of baseline safety evaluations and to obtain baseline measures of COPD status. At Visit 2, eligible subjects will start to take GSK573719/GW642444 125/25 mcg, and enter the treatment period. This treatment will be delivered via the Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (nDPI) once daily in the morning for 52 weeks. One nDPI will contain 30 doses of study medication. Subjects will be instructed to administer medication once daily in the morning for the duration of the 52-week treatment period. Each subject should be advised to adhere to this dosing regimen throughout the study. There will be a total of 8 study visits including at screening (Visit 1), initiation of treatment (Visit 2), and at 4weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 52 weeks (Visit 3 through Visit 8, respectively). Follow-up (Visit 9) will be conducted by the phone contact approximately 1 week following the completion/withdrawal of treatment period. A subject will be considered to have completed the study upon completion of the last on-treatment visit (Visit 8). At the end of the treatment period, subjects will be prescribed appropriate COPD medication at the investigator's discretion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Throughout the Treatment Period","timeFrame":"52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC/VI 125/25 Âµg","deltaMin":113,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":130},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Bronchitis","Pharyngitis","Constipation"]}}
