The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor (NGFI) class may offer an important breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of tanezumab 5 mg and 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) every 8 weeks versus placebo at Week 24 in subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The 2.5 mg dose was shown to provide efficacy benefits with a favorable safety profile when administered intravenously in previous Phase 3 clinical trials. The 5 mg dose is expected to provide added efficacy benefit over the 2.5 mg dose based on data from previous studies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.24,"sd":0.17},{"arm":"Tanezumab 2.5 mg","deltaMin":-2.7,"sd":0.17},{"arm":"Tanezumab 5 mg","deltaMin":-2.85,"sd":0.17}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0088"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":148,"countries":["Austria","Bulgaria","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38650049","38343426","37652258","37470295","37460782","36621827","36474952","36301512","35980115","35960482","35232805","35105318","34626502","33973384","33728717","32234715"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A4091057","https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A4091057&StudyName=A+Phase+3+Randomized%2C+Double-blind%2C+Placebo-controlled%2C+Multicenter+Study+Of+The+Analgesic+Efficacy+And+Safety+Of+The+Subcutaneous+Administration+Of+Tanezumab+In+Subjects+With+Osteoarthritis+Of+The+Hip+Or+Knee"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":282},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Nasopharyngitis","Back pain","Headache"]}}
