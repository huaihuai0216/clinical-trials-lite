The hypothesis is that sentinel nodes can be identified using only indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescence lymphangiography, without the need for technetium99 and a gamma probe.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Where the First, Second and Third Sentinel Nodes Localized With the Use of Fluorescence Imaging Alone","timeFrame":"Intraoperative, up to 1 hour","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Patients With Melanoma or Breast Cancer","deltaMin":29,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":35},"commonTop":["seroma","hematoma","SSI","rash"]}}
