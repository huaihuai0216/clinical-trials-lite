Efforts to decrease the high rates of AF have not made great inroads to the problem. The current standard of care is the use of preoperative and postoperative beta blockers. We propose to compare the use of prophylactic oral ascorbic acid with and without prophylactic oral amiodarone, in combination with oral beta blockers, for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery. The hypothesis is that either drug, or a combination of the two drugs, will be superior and safe when compared to beta blockers alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Occurrence of Post-operative Atrial Fibrillation Requiring Treatment After Open Heart Surgery","timeFrame":"5 postoperative days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Amiodarone - Yes","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"Amiodarone - No","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ascorbic Acid - Yes","deltaMin":58,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ascorbic Acid - No","deltaMin":48,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":76},"commonTop":["Atrial fibrillation"]}}
