Botulinum toxin type A is a purified substance, derived from a bacteria that block muscular nerve signals. Jessner's Peel, a combination of resorcinol (14g), salicylic acid (14g), and lactic acid (85%) in ethanol (95%), is a superficial chemical peel. These two products/procedures have been FDA approved to improve the appearance of facial wrinkles.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Posttreament Results of Chemical Peel if Botox A is Added as Pre-treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline and 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Botulinum Toxin","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemical Peel Only","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001","p":".002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":[]}}
