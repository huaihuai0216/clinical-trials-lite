For subjects that did not receive the investigational vaccine during the primary and booster study, the objective is to evaluate immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose catch-up vaccination with GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A.\n\nThis protocol posting deals with objectives \\& outcome measures of the extension phase.
