Diabetic ulcers are very challenging to manage and are the most common cause of leg amputation. Many advanced treatments are expensive and difficult to use in the clinic or at home. Those newer therapies have shown little success in healing diabetic foot wounds. The investigators' laboratory and animal work has suggested that a safe medication, currently used as an eye drop for treatment of glaucoma, can heal these ulcers. The investigators are proposing to test this drop (timolol) directly on the surface of the foot ulcer to see if can improve healing faster than the current standard of care. To do this, the investigators propose a \"randomized controlled trial\" with two groups of patients with diabetic foot ulcers: one will receive standard of care with timolol while the other will receive standard of care with a gel (hydrogel, as placebo medicine).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Complete Wound Closure, as Assessed Over a 12 Week Period","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Timolol","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"SOC Plus Non Biologically Active Gel","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32513257"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":[]}}
