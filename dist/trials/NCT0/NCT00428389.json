The study included a 5-week, open-label, randomized period followed by a 20-week open-label extension period. Patients were randomized to either an immediate switch from donepezil to rivastigmine patch formulation or to a switch to rivastigmine patch formulation following a 7-day withdrawal period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Discontinued From the Study Due to Any Reason During the Core Phase of the Study","timeFrame":"Baseline through the end of the core phase of the study (Week 5)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Switch","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"Delayed Switch","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19929593"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":131},"commonTop":["Application site reaction","Agitation","Fall","Vomiting","Urinary tract infection"]}}
