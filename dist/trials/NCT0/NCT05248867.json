AGN-151586 is an investigational product being developed for the treatment of GL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AGN-151586 for the treatment of GL in participants with moderate to severe GL.\n\nThis was a 12-week study in which eligible subjects were enrolled into the study containing 2 treatment periods, double-blind period and open-label period. Participants were randomly assigned to receive AGN-151586 or placebo. There was 1 in a 4 chance that participants would receive placebo. Around 600 adult participants with moderate to severe GL were to be enrolled in the study in approximately 38 sites across the world.\n\nParticipants received either AGN-151586 or Placebo administered as 5 intramuscular injections to the glabellar complex on Day 1. Participants meeting retreatment criteria may have received an open-label treatment of AGN-151586 during the study.\n\nParticipants attended regular visits during the study at a study site. The effect of the treatment was checked by medical assessments, blood tests, telephone calls, questionnaires and checking for side effects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Grade 0 or 1 and a â‰¥ 2-grade Improvement From Baseline on the FWS According to Both Investigator and Subject Assessments of Glabellar Lines (GL) Severity at Maximum Frown at Day 7 [US FDA]","timeFrame":"Baseline, Day 7 (Double-blind period)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"AGN-151586","deltaMin":60,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Hungary","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":156},"commonTop":["HEADACHE"]}}
