Oral micronized progesterone is molecularly identical to human progesterone, a steroid hormone. It is sold by prescription for use to prevent endometrial cancer in women taking estrogen in menopause. This research study will test whether progesterone reduces perimenopausal hot flushes and night sweats. It will also test whether progesterone improves sleep disturbances and anxiety.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)/ VMS Score - at 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Micronized Progesterone","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":8.2},{"arm":"Placebo Comparator","deltaMin":7.1,"sd":10.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22453200"],"seeAlso":["http://www.cemcor.ca"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":93},"commonTop":["Nausea, GI tract problems","Edema, atrial fibrillation, increased blood pressure, and headache","Musculoskeletal, arthritis, connective tissue issues","Dizziness","Worsening VMS"]}}
