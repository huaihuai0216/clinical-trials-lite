Using new guidelines of optimal vitamin D levels, more than 90% of African American women now suffer from vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency during pregnancy has profound effects on the developing fetus. Other systems besides bones are affected by vitamin D deficiency, including an increased risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and certain cancers.\n\nThis study proposes to examine and manage vitamin D levels in more than one thousand women in an underserved population in South Carolina. The women will be from the patient population seeking OB/GYN and Pediatric services through Eau Claire Cooperative Health Centers, Inc. (ECCHC), a network of ten clinics in three counties in the center of the state approximately 70 miles from Charleston, SC. ECCHC is one of approximately 1000 community health centers supported through Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA), Bureau of Primary Health Care.\n\nThe research objectives for this project will be managed through the Pediatric Nutritional Sciences Research Center of the Children's Research Institute at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, in collaboration with ECCHC. The research aims will evaluate vitamin D levels and possible contributing factors to the levels in pregnant women. Women who present to ECCHC within the first trimester of pregnancy will be randomized to one of two doses of vitamin D supplementation shown to be effective in other groups. Each pregnant mother will begin supplementation during the 12th week of pregnancy and will be followed closely throughout pregnancy for one year to determine the effectiveness of supplementation on vitamin D status, overall health of mother, and of her infant following delivery.\n\nWe expect to observe severe vitamin D deficiency in a considerable percentage of the mothers and their infants who receive care at ECCHC, especially those individuals with darker pigmentation. When the extent of vitamin D deficiency within each racial/ethnic group is better defined and their supplementation requirements identified, we will be better able to establish guidelines for supplementation and health maintenance, and set policy recommendations for the dietary recommended intake of vitamin D. Those women and their infants identified as deficient in vitamin D will be important in establishing community health care policies for vitamin D surveillance and supplementation strategies. The results will allow us to implement specific dietary and/or medical interventions aimed at correcting hypovitaminosis D in the population in this study and other similar populations being served by the more than 1000 community health centers nationally.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"25-hydroxyvitamin D at Visit 7","timeFrame":"7 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cholecalciferol 2000 IU","deltaMin":36.7,"sd":14.9},{"arm":"Cholecalciferol 4000 IU","deltaMin":39.8,"sd":12.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16895872","16636329","15585800","21197089"],"seeAlso":["http://www.thrasherresearch.org/","http://www.musc.edu"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":134},"commonTop":["Complications of Pregnancy"]}}
