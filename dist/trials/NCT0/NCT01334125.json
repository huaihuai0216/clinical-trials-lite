Double diabetes describes a clinical state where an individual possesses features of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. There is a paucity of data on the role of adjunctive metformin therapy in children and adolescents with double diabetes. To help fill this knowledge gap, the investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metformin in double diabetes. Specifically, the investigators will evaluate changes in hemoglobin A1c and anthropometry in patients with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes who also have features of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome as well as patients with type 2 diabetes who possess diabetes-associated autoantibodies. This will help determine the safety profile, and efficacy of adjunctive metformin therapy in these subjects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Baseline Adjusted Hemoglobin A1c Over Time","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3mo, 6mo, and 9 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin","deltaMin":9.46,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":9.85,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.903"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26367281"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":15},"commonTop":["Eye infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Otitis media","Hidradenitis"]}}
