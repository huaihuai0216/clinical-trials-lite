Several properties of oteseconazole (VT-1161) suggest that it might be a safer and more effective treatment for RVVC than other oral antifungal medicines.\n\nThis study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oteseconazole (VT-1161) for the treatment of RVVC and consists of 2 parts. The first part of the study is a 2-week period for the treatment of the patient's current VVC episode with 3 150mg doses of fluconazole. The 2nd part consists of 12 weeks, when the patient will take either oteseconazole (VT-1161) 150 mg or a placebo (according to a random assignment), and then a 36-week follow-up period.\n\nIn addition, at participating sites, an amendment to the study allows US patients who complete the initial 48 weeks without experiencing a confirmed RVVC episode to continue in a 48-week observational extension period designed to evaluate the continued effectiveness of oteseconazole (VT-1161).\n\nThis study is identical to VMT-VT-1161-CL-011.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With 1 or More Culture-verified Acute VVC Episodes During the Maintenance Phase of the Study in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population.","timeFrame":"Maintenance phase (post-randomization through Week 48)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oteseconazole (VT-1161)","deltaMin":3.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":39.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38319878","36396498"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":217},"commonTop":["Headache","Bacterial vaginosis","Nasopharyngitis","Urinary tract infection","Vulvovaginal pruritus"]}}
