The first-line treatment for nephrotic syndrome is corticosteroids. Many children respond to prednisone treatment, but the disease comes back (relapses) when the prednisone is stopped or the dose is reduced. Children with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome are at risk for toxicity from frequent exposure to corticosteroids.\n\nCurrently, the standard treatment for frequently relapsing and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome involves a variety of medications that suppress the immune system, which can produce serious side effects. We propose a study to examine the effects of a different medication, ACTH, on nephrotic syndrome. ACTH is a hormone naturally found in the body. Recently, in adult studies, ACTH has been shown to be effective for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome. It has also been shown to have mild and reversible side effects. ACTH is potentially an attractive therapeutic alternative for the treatment of frequently relapsing and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome in children. Our study will randomly assign patients with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome to either ACTH treatment or no treatment. This will allow us to study the effects of ACTH on this disease and its side effects, by comparing how patients do on ACTH treatment versus no treatment. We hypothesize that ACTH gel is superior to no treatment in maintaining remission in children with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Experienced a Relapse of Nephrotic Syndrome","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"No Treatment","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39513526"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":15},"commonTop":["Swelling, redness, rash at injection site","Sleep disturbances","Increase in Cushingoid symptoms","Flu and strep infections","Behavioral changes"]}}
