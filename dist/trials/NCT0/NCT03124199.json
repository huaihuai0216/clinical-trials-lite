Forty consecutive adult patients were included with H. pylori infection, dyspeptic symptoms and naive to eradication treatment. A full blood test was performed in the first 5 patients included to evaluate the safety of the treatment. H. pylori eradication was confirmed with urea breath test at least 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Treatment: Rifaximin 400 mg/8 h, clarithromycin 500 mg/12 h, amoxicillin 1 g/12 h, and omeprazole 20 mg/12 h for 10 days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With H.Pylori Infection Eradication","timeFrame":"1 month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rifaximin","deltaMin":61,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23601856","17991177","20656062","20525969","12694089","17083378","12786632","15225176","11151867","9820381","16086704","16128936","12144576","15162544","14991935","9860388","22491499","18783520","21294447","9732920"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Metallic Taste","Headache","Nausea","abdominal pain"]}}
