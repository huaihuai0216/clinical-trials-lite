Although clinical studies to date indicate that fasting lipid levels are minimally affected by DPP-4 inhibitor treatment, animal studies suggested that DPP-4 inhibition reduce intestinal triglyceride (TG) absorption and apolipoprotein production and increased chylomicron catabolism. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of sitagliptin on postprandial lipemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. A possible reduction in postprandial atherogenic triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) levels by sitagliptin would add to therapeutic utility of this DPP-4 inhibitor and suggest the potential to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Measurement of the Area Under the Curve of Plasma Triglycerides (TG) Levels During Postprandial Period (Time 0,2,4,6,8 Hours)","timeFrame":"At the end of the two 6-week interventions","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":30,"sd":14.5},{"arm":"Sitagliptin 100 mg/d","deltaMin":27.1,"sd":13}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25034387"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":[]}}
