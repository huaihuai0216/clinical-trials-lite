In this study patients and physicians know the name and the dose of the study drug. Newly diagnosed patients will also be included in the study. In general, the recommended Paliperidone ER dose will be 6 mg once daily, however some patients may require a higher or lower initial dose in the recommended range of 3 to 12 mg once daily. The dose can be adjusted any point during the study, to a maximum dose of 12mg/day. Flexible dosing was chosen to best mimic actual clinical practice.The safety assessments to be conducted throughout this study including the regular monitoring and recording of all Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Mean Modal Prescribed Daily Dose of Paliperidone Extended Release (ER) From Day 1 to Day 84","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Day 84","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Paliperidone Extended Release (ER)","deltaMin":6.9,"sd":2.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_JNJ_6051&studyid=236&filename=CR013213_CSR.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":64},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Headache","Nausea","Tremor","Akathisia"]}}
