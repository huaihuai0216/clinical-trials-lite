Following randomisation a strategy of early tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet and antithrombin therapy followed by catheterisation within 6-24 hours with timely coronary intervention as appropriate (or by rescue coronary intervention if required) in Group A will be compared to primary PCI performed according to local standards in Group B.\n\nThe study is exploratory in nature and will examine this medical question. The efficacy and safety endpoints as well as mixed (efficacy and safety) composite endpoints up to or before 30 days following randomisation will be evaluated.\n\nAll clinical endpoints of main interest will be assessed as single or composite endpoints for evaluation of the trial objective. All statistical tests are of exploratory nature based on descriptive p-values for formal statistical hypotheses generation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With All-cause Mortality, Cardiogenic Shock, Congestive Heart Failure and Recurrent Myocardial Infarction Within 30 Days for FAS.","timeFrame":"30 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tenecteplase (Group A)","deltaMin":116,"sd":null},{"arm":"Primary PCI (Group B)","deltaMin":135,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.195"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":201,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Norway","Peru","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39952376","39689189","28525886","26783237","26304934","25691510","25161043","24916050","23473396","20598969"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":146,"n":949},"commonTop":[]}}
