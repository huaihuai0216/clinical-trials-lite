In this study we will determine whether salsalate, a member of the commonly used Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) class, is effective in lowering sugars in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will determine whether salicylates represent a new pharmacological option for diabetes management. The study is conducted in two stages. The first stage is a dose ranging study, administering salsalate compared to placebo over three months. The primary objective of Stage 2 of the study is to evaluate the effects of salsalate on blood sugar control in diabetes; the tolerability of salsalate use in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); and the effects of salsalate on measures of inflammation, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiac risk.\n\nThe second stage is a second trial and posted under alternate registration.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in HbA1c Baseline to End of Trial in TINSAL-T2D Stage 1","timeFrame":"14 week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"3.0 g/d","deltaMin":-0.36,"sd":null},{"arm":"3.5 g/d","deltaMin":-0.34,"sd":null},{"arm":"4.0 g/d","deltaMin":-0.49,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.01,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16823477","17959861","19337387","23817699","20231565"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":27},"commonTop":["Neurologic","Gastrointestinal","Musculoskeletal","Hypoglycemia","General"]}}
