All subjects will receive Q2-week oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Control arm subjects will not receive concomitant panitumumab therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (Oxaliplatin)","timeFrame":"Overall study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab Plus Panitumumab","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oxaliplatin and Bevacizumab Without Panitumumab","deltaMin":11.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.011"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["19114685","31378656","30679026"],"seeAlso":["http://www.vectibix.com/","http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":306,"n":518},"commonTop":["DIARRHOEA","NAUSEA","FATIGUE","VOMITING","CONSTIPATION"]}}
