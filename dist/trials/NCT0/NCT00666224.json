The secondary objective is to assess, within the time frame of the up to 3-year double-blind, placebo-controlled study period, the effect of GA on clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) parameters. The long-term objectives of the study (exploratory in nature) are to assess, within the time frame of 5 years, the neuroprotective effect of early versus delayed treatment with GA as reflected by clinical and MRI parameters measuring the accumulated irreversible brain tissue damage.\n\nA pre-planned interim analysis was performed on all efficacy and safety data accumulated in the database up to October 14, 2007, i.e. when 81% of exposure to treatment in the double-blind, placebo-controlled period had been collected. Upon review of the interim analysis results, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended that the double-blind portion of the study be stopped and that subjects be switched to the 2-year Open-label period, during which time they would have the option of receiving GA therapy. The sponsor (Teva) adopted the DMC recommendations and took the necessary action towards its implementation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) Conversion","timeFrame":"up to 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Glatiramer Acetate (Double-blind Period)","deltaMin":657.85,"sd":349.3},{"arm":"Placebo (Double-blind Period)","deltaMin":590.54,"sd":340.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0005"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["19815268"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":238},"commonTop":["Injection site erythema","Nasopharyngitis","Injection site pain","Headache","Influenza"]}}
