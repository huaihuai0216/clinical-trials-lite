Efficacy and safety evaluations were performed at Screening (safety only), Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All Investigator's Global Assessment evaluators and lesion counters must be trained and approved by Galderma. The evaluator of a participant should remain the same during the study.\n\nThe primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority in efficacy and assess safety of adapalene/benzoyl peroxide topical gel (adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel) versus adapalene topical gel, 0.1% (adapalene monad); benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 2.5% (benzoyl peroxide monad) and topical gel vehicle (gel vehicle) in the treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Success Rate 0 (Clear) or 1 (Almost Clear) on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) Scale at Week 12 (Last Observation Carried Forward)","timeFrame":"At Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel","deltaMin":30.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adapalene Gel, 0.1%","deltaMin":19.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Benzoyl Peroxide Gel 2.5%","deltaMin":22.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gel Vehicle","deltaMin":11.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12963896","19746769"],"seeAlso":["http://www.galderma.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":415},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Dry skin"]}}
