Participants will be randomized to receive either gantenerumab subcutaneously every 4 weeks or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks. Approved Alzheimer medication is allowed if on stable dose for 3 months prior to screening. Part 2 is an open-label extension (OLE).\n\nA positron emission tomography (PET) imaging substudy will be conducted within the main study. Eligible participants who provide separate informed consent will undergo PET imaging scans using the radioligand florbetapir as a pharmacodynamic measure of changes in brain amyloid load over time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"First dose up to 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug (up to 249 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 2 (OLE Treatment): Placebo Switched to Gantenerumab up to 1200 mg","deltaMin":91.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2 (OLE Treatment): Gantenerumab up to 1200 mg","deltaMin":95.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":131,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Portugal","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31831056"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":195},"commonTop":["Injection site reaction","ARIA-E","ARIA-H","Fall","Headache"]}}
