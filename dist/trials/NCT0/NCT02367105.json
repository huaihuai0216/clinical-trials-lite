In addition, the population of obese older Veterans is rapidly increasing as more baby boomers become senior citizens. In older Veterans, obesity exacerbates the age- related decline in physical function and causes frailty which predisposes to admission to a VA chronic care facility. However, the optimal clinical approach to obesity in older adults is controversial because of the concern that weight loss therapy could be harmful by aggravating the age-related loss of muscle mass and bone mass. In fact, the MOVE (Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans) program does not have any guidelines for eligible Veterans if they are 70 or older. It is possible that the addition of testosterone replacement to lifestyle therapy will preserve muscle mass and bone mass and reverse frailty in obese older Veterans and thus prevent their loss of independence and decrease demand for VA health care services.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in the Physical Performance Test","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo + Lifestyle Therapy","deltaMin":4.6,"sd":0.3},{"arm":"Testosterone + Lifestyle Therapy","deltaMin":4.9,"sd":0.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.58"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34375393"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":41},"commonTop":["hypoglycemia, asymptomatic and symptomatic","Elevated PSA","Dizziness/orthostasis"]}}
