Magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used to measure changes in the brain's metabolic profile following an experimental immune stimulus, to test whether individuals with fibromyalgia show a heightened immune response in the brain. The ultimate goal of this research is to better understand the role of brain inflammation in the pathophysiology of chronic pain and fatigue, which will guide the development of more effective therapies for these conditions.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Ratio of Choline/ Creatine (CHO/CR) in the Brain From Baseline to 3 Hrs Post-endotoxin Administration","timeFrame":"3 hours (From Baseline to 3 Hrs Post-endotoxin Administration)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Healthy Control","deltaMin":-0.0021,"sd":0.01664},{"arm":"Fibromyalgia","deltaMin":-0.0058,"sd":0.01465}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
