Most cases of HAT are due to the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T.b. gambiense), which is transmitted by the bite of the tsetse fly. HAT can be fatal without diagnosis and treatment. Several treatment options are currently available to treat HAT caused by the T.b. gambiense parasite (g-HAT), but these treatments can be administered only after demonstrating via microscopy the presence of the parasite in a body fluid. However, there are factors such as low parasitaemia and the complexity and low sensitivity of parasitological methods that make such demonstration difficult. It has been demonstrated that a variable proportion (mainly depending on the prevalence) of such g-HAT \"sero-suspects\" are confirmed cases and, therefore, remain potential reservoirs of the parasite and a source of new infections hindering the efforts to eliminate the disease.\n\nThe drug acoziborole was evaluated in a study called \"DNDi-OXA-02-HAT\". During this study, patients with g-HAT from the DRC and Guinea took a single dose of acoziborole. This study showed that acoziborole has a high efficacy and is safe for treating patients with confirmed g-HAT .\n\nThe present study is called \"DNDi-OXA-04-HAT\". It included seropositive participants from the DRC and Guinea who did not have parasites detected via microscopy in a body fluid. Its objective was to collect data on the safety and tolerability of a single dose of acoziborole compared to a placebo (i.e. a dummy treatment). The results of this study would help decide if acoziborole can be used in the population of g-HAT seropositive individuals and help eliminate the HAT disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Occurrence of Any TEAEs","timeFrame":"From the investigational product administration (Day 1) to the Month 4 follow-up visit (End of Study).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Acoziborole","deltaMin":195,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":69,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["Democratic Republic of the Congo","Guinea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":906},"commonTop":["Headache","Malaria","Abdominal pain","Fatigue","Acarodermatitis"]}}
