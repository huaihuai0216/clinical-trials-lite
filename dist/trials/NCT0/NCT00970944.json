To determine whether amantadine hydrochloride, given in a dose of 200-400 mg, improves functional recovery from the vegetative and minimally conscious states\n2. To determine whether amantadine-related gains in function persist following drug discontinuation\n3. To determine the safety profile of amantadine in patients with disorders of consciousness","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disability Rating Scale: Functional Status","timeFrame":"Randomization and weekly for 6 weeks.
