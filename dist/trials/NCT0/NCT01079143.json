These markers, when present, suggest that the epithelial cell undergoes a phenomenon well known as \"epithelial to mesenchymal transition\" (EMT) and could behaves like a myo-fibroblast. EMT is highly instrumental in several models of tissue fibrosis, including in the kidney. Actually, it has not only been demonstrated that these markers are detectable in the renal graft at an early time point post-transplant (i.e. as soon as three months), but also that the intensity of their expression correlates with the progression of interstitial fibrosis of the graft between 3 and 12 months","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Progression of Renal Graft Fibrosis (Primary Comparison - ITT Population","timeFrame":"Month 3 (M3) and Month 12 (M12) post transplantation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Certican EMT+","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Neoral EMT+","deltaMin":31,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31530561"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":39,"n":98},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Aphthous stomatitis","Dyslipidaemia","Anaemia","Neutropenia"]}}
