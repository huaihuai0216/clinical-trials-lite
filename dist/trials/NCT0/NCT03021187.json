The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide versus placebo in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus treated with insulin. All subjects should continue their pre-trial insulin therapy (basal, basal-bolus or premixed regimen including combinations of soluble insulins) throughout the trial. Subjects treated with metformin in addition to insulin treatment must continue their metformin treatment throughout the entire trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in HbA1c (Week 26)","timeFrame":"Week 0, week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 3 mg","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":1},{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 7 mg","deltaMin":-1,"sd":1.1},{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 14 mg","deltaMin":-1.3,"sd":1.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.1,"sd":0.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":118,"countries":["United States","Canada","France","Greece","India","Japan","Mexico","Poland","Puerto Rico","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31530667","33660198","32998732","32267058","31903692"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":184},"commonTop":["Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Decreased appetite","Vomiting"]}}
