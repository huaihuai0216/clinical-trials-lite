Approximately half of FSGS patients will lose kidney function within 8 years of diagnosis and will require dialysis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether intermittent oral steroid therapy can cause sustained remission of FSGS and MCD.\n\nApproximately 70 participants, including adults and children older than age 2, will be enrolled in this study. They will receive 48 doses of oral dexamethasone over a period of 48 weeks. One group will take two daily doses every 2 weeks; the other group will take four daily doses every 4 weeks. Doctors will monitor participants before, during, and after the steroid treatment with extensive exams and testing. At the completion of the study, researchers will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Remission Status of Patients After Intermittent Oral Dexamethasone Administered Over 48 Weeks","timeFrame":"48 weeks from baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2 Doses Every 2 Weeks Arm","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"4 Doses Every 4 Weeks Arm","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9074"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["9260238","11322372","3746552","35224732"],"seeAlso":["http://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?B_2003-DK-0226.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":4},"commonTop":["Mood swings","sleep disturbance","Headache","Change in appetite","Weight gain"]}}
