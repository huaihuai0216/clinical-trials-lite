The estimated total sample size is 600 patients from 2 sites in Cambodia and 2 sites in Vietnam. There are 2 treatment arms Arm 1: Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 days Arm 2: Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 days plus Amodiaquine for 3 days. According to the World Health Organization guideline, all patients except children under 10 kilograms will also be treated with a single dose of primaquine as a gametocytocidal treatment.\n\nFunder :Bill \\& Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) Grant reference number: OPP1132628","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Polymerase Chain Reaction Corrected Efficacy Defined as Adequate Clinical and Parasitological Response (ACPR) by Study Arm","timeFrame":"42 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 Days Plus Primaquine at Hour 24","deltaMin":146,"sd":null},{"arm":"Artemether-lumefantrine for 3 Days Plus Amodiaquine for 3 Days Plus Primaquine at Hour 24","deltaMin":151,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.38"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Cambodia","Vietnam"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35276064"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":154},"commonTop":["anaemia","thrombocytopenia","abdominal pain","aspartate transferase (AST)","headache"]}}
