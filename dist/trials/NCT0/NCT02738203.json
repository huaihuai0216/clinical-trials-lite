The investigators aim to explore whether adequate pain relief is possible through self-administered, non-invasive means alone. Reducing pain associated with IUD insertion may benefit patients and providers. When patients are comfortable during their procedure, it is likely the provider can more quickly and with fewer complications perform the insertion. The investigators propose to explore the effect of a locally applied vaginal lidocaine gel in place of the standard of care pain management, no intervention, prior to IUD insertions. This is a superiority, blinded, randomized controlled trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"(IUD Insertion): Pain Perceived by Visual Analogue Scale (0-100 mm) Immediately Following Procedure Completion","timeFrame":"0-3 minutes after procedure completed","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental, IUD Insertion Group","deltaMin":65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control, IUD Insertion Group","deltaMin":59,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30444982"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":108},"commonTop":[]}}
