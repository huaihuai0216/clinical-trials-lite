As a secondary purpose, the investigators intend to confirm the salutatory effect of cinnamon on insulin resistance in larger group of study subjects.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a very common condition found in women of childbearing age. PCOS patients often have irregular periods, extra hair growth, or difficulty becoming pregnant. The syndrome can also be associated with more serious conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer of the uterus. Although no one knows the cause of the syndrome, scientific studies showed that having too much insulin can be one of the reasons. In fact, almost every overweight woman with PCOS has been found to have high insulin levels.\n\nRecently studies using rats and mice have shown that a commonly used spice, cinnamon, may also reduce the body's insulin level. Another study showed that daily use of cinnamon for forty days lowered the blood sugar level in patients with diabetes. Our own study also showed that using cinnamon everyday for 8 weeks decreased insulin resistance in women with PCOS. The purpose of this study is to see if cinnamon can help women with PCOS have more regular periods.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Menses During the Six Month Study Period.","timeFrame":"Up to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cinnamon Extract Arm","deltaMin":0.42,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Arm","deltaMin":0.42,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24813595"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":23},"commonTop":["Headache","Menstrual cramps","Back pain","Cold","Nausea"]}}
