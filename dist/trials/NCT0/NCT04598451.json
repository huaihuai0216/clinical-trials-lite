The trial comprises a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period of up to 30 weeks, and an 8-week follow-up period for participants who do not enroll into the open-label extension (OLE) trial ARGX-113-1905. The primary objective of the ARGX-113-1904 trial is to demonstrate the efficacy of subcutaneous administration of efgartigimod co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (Efgartigimod PH20 SC) compared to placebo in the treatment of participants with Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV). Secondary objectives are to also demonstrate the efficacy of efgartigimod PH20 SC in the treatment of participants with Pemphigus Foliaceus (PF), and to demonstrate early onset of action and a prednisone-sparing effect. After confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomized in a 2: 1 ratio to receive efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV) Participants Who Achieve Complete Clinical Remission (CR) on Minimal Prednisone Therapy","timeFrame":"up to 30 weeks treatment period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Efgartigimod PH20 SC","deltaMin":44,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo PH20 SC","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":134,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bulgaria","China","France","Georgia","Germany","Greece","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Japan","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":147},"commonTop":["INSOMNIA","HYPERTENSION","COVID-19","MYOPATHY","BLOOD LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE INCREASED"]}}
