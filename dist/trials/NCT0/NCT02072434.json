It will see if edoxaban prevents stroke and other blood clotting problems as well and as safely as warfarin. People with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) might be able to join. Their doctors must plan to use shock to make their hearts beat normally. About 2200 people from different countries will join. They will have an equal chance of receiving either treatment. They are anticipated to be in the study for around 82 days. Tests will include physicals and finger-pricks. Participants will provide blood and urine samples.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Composite Endpoint of Stroke, Systemic Embolic Stroke (SEE), Myocardial Infarction (MI) and Cardiovascular (CV) Mortality From Randomization to End of Follow up","timeFrame":"Randomization to end of follow-up (within 2 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Edoxaban","deltaMin":0.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Warfarin","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":228,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24251359","29947751","27590218","25965706"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":85,"n":1067},"commonTop":["Atrial fibrillation"]}}
