In absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART), poor prognosis, high mortality and high relapse rates are characteristic of Ethiopian VL patients with HIV co-infection. Conversely, co-infection can be successfully managed via a combination of effective treatment of the initial episode, timely ART and prevention of relapses.\n\nActually, until cellular immunity returns with ART, the patient is at risk of VL relapses, which can result in death, severe illness, reduced ART efficacy, drug-resistance and possibly transmission of drug-resistant Leishmania donovani. Patients most vulnerable to relapses are those with high levels of immunosuppression, with previous VL episodes, or with opportunistic infections (OIs). The most important factor to prevent relapses seems to be the clearance of visible parasites.\n\nLimited studies in Europe show that HIV co-infected patients may benefit from secondary prevention with antimonials (part of mainstay treatment for VL in Ethiopia) and pentamidine (PM), not used for VL treatment in Africa. Such maintenance treatment has not been studied in African VL, but the poor outcomes without secondary prevention highlight a need of better care to patients at risk of relapse.\n\nThis prospective cohort study aims at documenting the patient's outcomes of secondary prophylaxis with PM in VL-HIV co-infection, in terms of time to relapse or death, safety and feasibility, before it can be considered for general use in Ethiopia. A placebo group is not included, due to the clear advantages of the intervention to the patient population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Probability of Relapse-free Survival","timeFrame":"up to 1 year after the start of the intervention (PSP)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pentamidine Secondary Prophylaxis (PSP)","deltaMin":79,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Ethiopia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29020217"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":74},"commonTop":["Pneumonia","Visceral leishmaniasis","Malaria","Gastroenteritis","Nasal congestion"]}}
