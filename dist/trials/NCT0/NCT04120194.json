Both vaccines were formulated with the 4 influenza strains recommended for the 2019-20 Northern hemisphere influenza season. 2654 subjects were enrolled and randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive either NanoFlu or active comparator. Subjects were followed for approximately 1 year following injection; with primary immunogenicity analyses based on Day 28 sera. This trial was conducted in the United States at approximately 19 clinical sites.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"HAI Antibody Responses for Vaccine Homologous Influenza Strains Expressed as Ratio of Geometric Mean Fold Ratio (GMFR)","timeFrame":"Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NanoFlu","deltaMin":1.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluzone Quadrivalent","deltaMin":1.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34563277"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":136,"n":1333},"commonTop":[]}}
