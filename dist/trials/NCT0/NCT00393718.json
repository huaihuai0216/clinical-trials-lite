The trial aims for comparison of the effect on glycaemic control of liraglutide, compared to sulfonylurea (SU treatment), as assessed by HbA1c after 24 and 52 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Trial has a randomisation period of 24 weeks followed by a 28 week extension period, in total 52 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) After 24 Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"after 24 weeks of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide","deltaMin":6.99,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Glibenclamide","deltaMin":7.5,"sd":0.09}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20199137","24843595","23010561","21209033"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":268},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract inflammation","Constipation","Back pain"]}}
