Pneumonia develops when bacteria and other agents invade the lungs. The body's immune system creates a response to produce inflammation to kill the bacteria. A moderate amount of inflammation is beneficial. But, in patients sick enough to be admitted to the ICU, inflammation is frequently out of control. When the body cannot regulate inflammation vital organs (brain, heart, lung, kidney, liver) may be damaged, contributing to death or residual organ damage for those who survive. Glucocorticoids help reduce inflammation. Recent studies have shown that when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of glucocorticoids, inflammation can get out of control. Under these circumstances, glucocorticoids given in small doses may help aid the body's ability to reduce inflammation and improve recovery. In a small preliminary trial, glucocorticoid treatment, in addition to standard antibiotic treatment, sped up recovery from pneumonia. It also decreased the length of hospital stay, and increased survival. This Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) study will be the first large-scale, prospective, randomized clinical trial evaluating whether or not this treatment improves recovery.\n\nIn this study, at each site, patients with severe CAP will be assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group will receive methylprednisolone and the other will receive a placebo (an inert substance that will look like the drug). The investigators have chosen a total duration of treatment of 20 days (7 days full dose followed by slow reduction over 13 days) to prevent relapse of inflammation and allow the body to recover its own ability to produce glucocorticoid. All patients will also receive standardized management of CAP in accordance with current practice guidelines. The study will take into consideration when assigning the treatment each participating site, and whether or not the patient requires mechanical ventilation at the time of assignment. Patients will be followed clinically for 180 days. The primary outcome is all cause 60-day mortality. Secondary outcomes are (1) in-hospital morbidity-mortality, including ventilator-free days, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS)-free days, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and hospital discharge; and (2) posthospital discharge morbidity-mortality, including cardiovascular complications, functional and general health status in the first 180 days, rehospitalization, and mortality at 1 year. Serial blood samples will also be collected and stored for future translational research relating longitudinal inflammation markers to clinical outcomes.\n\nThis study will advance knowledge on the relationship between inflammation and long-term outcome in severe CAP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"60-day Mortality","timeFrame":"60-day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Inactive Substance","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Methylprednisolone","deltaMin":47,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.635"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35723686"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":162,"n":287},"commonTop":[]}}
