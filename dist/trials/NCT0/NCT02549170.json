Gammagard and Kiovig are the brand names for the same immunoglobulin compound.\n\nThe study is in two parts. In Part 1, participants receive either HyQvia or a placebo subcutaneously. In Part 2 (only for participants who have a CIPD relapse during Part 1), participants will receive Gammagard Liquid/Kiovig intravenously. US participants will receive Gamunex-C.\n\nThe first SC infusion will be given in the study clinic. The remaining SC infusions may be given in the study clinic or the participant's home. This will be decided by the study doctor and whether the participant or their caregiver can do the self-infusion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Epoch 1: Relapse Rate","timeFrame":"Week 32 End of Epoch 1 Treatment (EOET1)/Unscheduled relapse visit assessment (UV)/Early Termination (ET)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Epoch 1: Placebo With rHuPH20","deltaMin":31.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Epoch 1: HYQVIA/HyQvia","deltaMin":9.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.0045"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":83,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Norway","Poland","Serbia","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b5fc54db2bf003ab45bd5"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":70},"commonTop":["Headache","Pyrexia","Fatigue","Nausea","Infusion site pain"]}}
