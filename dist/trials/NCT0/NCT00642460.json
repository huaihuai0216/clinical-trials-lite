In Part I of the study patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive iv infusions of RoActemra/Actemra (8mg/kg iv for patients \\>=30kg, or 12mg/kg for patients \\<30kg) or placebo, every 2 weeks. Stable NSAIDs and methotrexate will be continued throughout. After 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, all patients will have the option to enter Part II of the study to receive open-label treatment with RoActemra/Actemra for a further 92 weeks, followed by a 3-year continuation of the study in Part III in which, for patients who meet specific criteria, an optional alternative dosing schedule decreasing the study drug administration frequency will be introduced. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to 5 years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part I: Percentage of Participants With â‰¥30% Improvement in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Core Set and Absence of Fever","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab","deltaMin":85.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":24.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":54,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","Germany","Greece","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32912276","30824645","25504861","23252525"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":48,"n":112},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Cough","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis","Diarrhoea"]}}
