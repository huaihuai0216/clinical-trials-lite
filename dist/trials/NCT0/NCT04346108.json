This study will be in 3 parts:\n\nPart 1: Infusions with Immunoglobulin Intravenous (IGIV) every 3 or 4 weeks for 13 weeks.\n\nPart 2: Participants will switch to weekly subcutaneous infusions with IGSC, 20% for 24 weeks.\n\nPart 3: A subset will receive biweekly subcutaneous infusions with IGSC, 20% for 12 weeks.\n\nThe main aim of the study is to assess base levels of Immunoglobulin globulin G (IgG) levels in the blood of the participants after weekly and biweekly treatment with IGSC, 20% (in Parts 2 and 3 of the study). Their PID will be treated by their doctor according to their doctor's usual clinical practice.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Epoch 2: Total Serum Trough Levels of Immune Globulin G (IgG) Antibodies During Period 2","timeFrame":"Epoch 2 (period 2): Up to 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Epoch 2: IGSC (20%) 50-200 mg/kg","deltaMin":8.56,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Headache","Stomatitis","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
