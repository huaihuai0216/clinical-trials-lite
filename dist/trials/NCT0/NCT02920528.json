The investigators also aim to determine whether use of SDDK can reduce the amount of subsequent opioid pain medications required for adequate pain relief in this population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"To Compare the Percentage of Subjects Who Achieved Significant Pain Relief Between the 3 Treatment Groups as Measured by a Visual Analog Pain Scale at 60 Minutes A Decrease of at Least 20 mm on the VAS Will be Considered \"Significant\" Pain Relief","timeFrame":"60 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Very Low Dose Ketamine","deltaMin":28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Low Dose Ketamine","deltaMin":25,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30901130"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
