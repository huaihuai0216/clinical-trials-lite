Oral olanzapine was used to assess the validity of the study design. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of risperidone LAI versus placebo in the prevention of a mood episode (recurrence event) in patients with bipolar I disorder after a 12-week (3 month) stabilization period on risperidone LAI, as measured by the time to recurrence of any mood episode. Risperidone LAI has been approved by the FDA in the USA for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and for the prevention of mood recurrences in bipolar I disorder, as monotherapy or add-on treatment. It is approved at EMEA and other European and non-European health authorities for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, too.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Recurrence of a Mood Episode (Risperidone LAI Versus Placebo)","timeFrame":"Assessed at every visit from the moment of randomization to a treatment arm (baseline Period III) until the end of treatment (Month 21 or earlier)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Risperidone LAI","deltaMin":293.39,"sd":15.93},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":270.47,"sd":17.74}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.057"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":63,"countries":["China","Colombia","Germany","Greece","India","Indonesia","Jordan","Lebanon","Malaysia","Mexico","Peru","Philippines","Russia","South Africa","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_JNJ_6051&studyid=26&filename=CR012145_CSR.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":132},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Weight increased","Headache","Akathisia","Anxiety"]}}
