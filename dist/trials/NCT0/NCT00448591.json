All patients will receive Avastin (10mg/kg iv every 2 weeks, or 15 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks) plus taxane-based chemotherapy. If taxanes are contraindicated, alternative chemotherapy (other than anthracyclines or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) may be used. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs) Related to Bevacizumab, Death, and AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)","timeFrame":"Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 up to 6 months after the last bevacizumab infusion","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bevacizumab","deltaMin":95.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":457,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Colombia","Czechia","Ecuador","Egypt","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lebanon","Lithuania","Mexico","Morocco","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Saudi Arabia","Slovakia","Slovenia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25047747","22490570"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":672,"n":2264},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Alopecia","Epistaxis","Hypertension","Nausea"]}}
