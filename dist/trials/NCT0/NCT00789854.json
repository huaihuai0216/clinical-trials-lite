As an independent objective, the primary objective will also be evaluated in two subgroups of patients: (1) patients who were resistant to two previous antidepressant therapies and (2) in the subgroup of patients with one previous failure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Depressive Symptoms Between Randomisation and Week 6 Measured by Change in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score (Per Protocol Analysis Set)","timeFrame":"6 weeks treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Quetiapine XR Mono","deltaMin":-16.2,"sd":0.843},{"arm":"Add-on Quetiapine XR","deltaMin":-17.2,"sd":0.826},{"arm":"Add-on Lithium","deltaMin":-14.9,"sd":0.97}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":106,"countries":["Australia","Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Portugal","Romania","Slovakia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23810357"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":228},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Fatigue","Dry mouth","Headache","Sedation"]}}
