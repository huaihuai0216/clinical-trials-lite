Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using flutamide, goserelin, and leuprolide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known which regimen of antiandrogen therapy is most effective for prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without antiandrogen therapy in treating patients who have stage I or stage II prostate cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival Rate (10-year)","timeFrame":"From date of randomization to 10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hormone Therapy + Radiation Therapy","deltaMin":61.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Radiation Therapy Alone","deltaMin":56.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0309"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":239,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19779119","21751904","38320143","34481017"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":1003},"commonTop":["Acute RT Toxicity: Bowel: NOS","Late RT Toxicity: Bowel: NOS","Late RT Toxicity: Bladder: NOS","Acute RT Toxicity: Bladder: NOS","Hormone Toxicity: Hot flashes : NOS"]}}
