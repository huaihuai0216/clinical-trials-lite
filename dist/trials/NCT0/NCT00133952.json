SMVL is defined as a 15 letter or more decrease from baseline in best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity that is sustained for the patient's last 6 months of study participation. The SMVL data from this study will be combined with the SMVL data from Study B7A-MC-MBDL for the purpose of comparing ruboxistaurin to placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Moderate Visual Loss (SMVL) Any Time Baseline Through Month 48","timeFrame":"Baseline through 48 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ruboxistaurin","deltaMin":2.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.724"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":41,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","Germany","Lithuania","Mexico","Portugal","Romania","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23404115"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":153},"commonTop":["Headache","Hypertension","Diarrhoea","Influenza","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
