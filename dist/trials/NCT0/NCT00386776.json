We developed the computer-based medical interview consisting of over 6000 questions and a corresponding program that provides a concisely written, summary of the patient's responses to the questions in the interview. We then conducted read aloud and test/retest reliability evaluations of the interview and summary programs and determined the programs to be reliable. Results were published in the November 27, 2010 issue of the Journal of the American medical Informatics Association. We also developed, edited, and revised a program that provides a concisely written, summary of the patient's responses to the questions in the interview.\n\nWe obtained a grant from the Rx Foundation to conduct clinical trial of our medical history. At the time of the office visit, the summary of the computer-based history of those patients who had completed the interview was available on the doctor's computer screen for the doctor and patient to use together on a voluntary basis. The results of this trial were published in the January 2012 issue of the Journal of the American Informatics Association.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patient Post Medical History Assessment Questionnaire","timeFrame":"Immediately after taking the medical history","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Computer-based Medical History","deltaMin":8.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["5902618","12528879","2607929","27699348","12558354","18144531","13636498","14153274","5689697","5650983","4871715","5141376","1001281","6400563","7372476","6848849","5696987","6571302","5635452","5425111","5431936","5107557","4555663","4555941","5395419","4559782","5030841","4585280","4593190","1185132","779466","786434","334310","6844461","6831131","6841771","6631616","6722016","3821297","3526028","3306899","3595100","3147730","1888045","7949919","7898822","8847468","8923563","8824103","9094933","10538645","10846345","11223765","1507376","79024","354858","956580","977878","327837","7854075","3838364","10405878","5936301","5024461","2308504","5826481","5019502","1749339","7024808","2243548","5538704","3345654","10098556","11644706","9000843","9066242","2802433","14214042","22237866","21113077"],"seeAlso":["http://www.bidmc.harvard.edu"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
