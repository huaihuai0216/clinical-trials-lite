The current standard treatment for this disease is radiation therapy to the brain. The goal of the current study is to test whether the combination of orally administered HYCAMTIN capsules and whole brain radiation therapy will prolong the survival time of patients with this potentially serious condition.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From the time of Randomization until the date of death due to any cause (up to 195 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Chemoradiation: Topotecan Plus WBRT","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Radiation: WBRT Alone","deltaMin":3.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1862"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":88,"countries":["United States","Canada","Hungary","Poland","Russia","Slovakia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":96,"n":235},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fatigue","Vomiting","Headache","Dyspnoea"]}}
