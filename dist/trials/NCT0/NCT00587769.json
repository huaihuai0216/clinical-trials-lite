The aim of the current study is to assess the safety and compliance as well as obtain preliminary estimates of efficacy and effect on craving and nicotine withdrawal of combination therapy with bupropion SR and varenicline. We will compare the efficacy estimates in this study with historical smoking abstinence rates with varenicline. To accomplish our aims, we will enroll 38 cigarette smokers in an open-label, phase II clinical trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Point Prevalence Smoking Abstinence at 12 Weeks: the Number of Patients Who Refrained From Smoking at 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Medication Arm","deltaMin":27,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://ndc.mayo.edu/mayo/research/nicotine_research_center/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Sleep disturbance","Nausea","Insomnia","Dizziness","Vivid dreams"]}}
