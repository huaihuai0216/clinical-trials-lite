Participation in this study will involve 12 weeks of pharmacological intervention during which participants will be randomized to receive either oral albuterol 4mg twice daily or placebo. All investigators and study participants will be blinded to randomization by our research pharmacy. Participation in the study will require study subjects to come to our lab for the total of 2 visits (at baseline and after week 12), during which a series of tests will be performed to assess their respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Inspiratory Respiratory Muscle Strength","timeFrame":"Outcome will be measured at baseline, prior to intervention, and after 12 weeks of twice daily drug treatment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Control","deltaMin":82.35,"sd":18.07},{"arm":"Active Drug","deltaMin":79.19,"sd":29.72}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":[]}}
