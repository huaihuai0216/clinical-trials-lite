Giving gemcitabine directly into the bladder after surgery may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving gemcitabine directly into the bladder is more effective than a placebo in treating bladder cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine to see how well it works when given directly into the bladder compared with a placebo after surgery in treating patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent bladder cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease Recurrence Rate","timeFrame":"Up to 2 Years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I","deltaMin":27.86,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II","deltaMin":40,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35871040","29801011"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":165},"commonTop":["Urinary frequency/urgency","Pain - Bladder","Hemorrhage, GU - Urinary NOS","Bladder spasms","Urinary retention (including neurogenic bladder)"]}}
