Two main medications (plus ancillary non-placebo controlled medications) and their placebos (inactive drugs) will be utilized to treat both alcohol withdrawal, promote abstinence, and reduce drinking over approximately a six-week treatment period. All participants will meet criteria for Alcohol Dependence and be drinking heavily up until 72 hours prior to receiving the first study drug. They will be injected one drug (flumazenil or placebo) over a two day period and receive the second one (gabapentin or placebo) by mouth for 39 days. The main hypothesis is that this protocol will reduce early alcohol withdrawal symptoms and will reduce relapse to drinking and promote abstinence compared to the placebo (inactive) drug group. Secondary outcomes that will be evaluated include reduction in craving, improvement in sleep, brain activity and mood.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Subjects Completely Abstinent","timeFrame":"6 week trial","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Low CIWA Flumazenil/Gabapentin","deltaMin":44,"sd":null},{"arm":"Low CIWAar Placebo","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"High CIWAar Placebo","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"High CIWAar Flumazenil/Gabapentin","deltaMin":71,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.03"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19593171","21631542"],"seeAlso":["http://www.muschealth.com/cdap/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":[]}}
