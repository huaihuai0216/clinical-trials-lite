Letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known which regimen of letrozole is more effective in postmenopausal women who have received hormone therapy for early-stage breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different regimens of letrozole in preventing cancer in postmenopausal women who have received 4-6 years of hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-positive, early-stage breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-free Survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"5-year estimates, reported at a median follow-up of 60 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Continuous Letrozole","deltaMin":87.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Intermittent Letrozole","deltaMin":85.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".31"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":164,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Chile","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Italy","Japan","New Zealand","Peru","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33082214","29158011"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1004,"n":2411},"commonTop":["Pain - Joint","Hot flashes/flushes","Osteoporosis","Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Insomnia"]}}
