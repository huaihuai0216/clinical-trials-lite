Study medication will be administered through subcutaneous (under the skin) injections, beginning with twice weekly injections for the first 4 weeks, followed by once weekly doses for 48 weeks. Following the last treatment, a safety follow-up period of 24 weeks will be conducted.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Experiencing a New Flare as Defined by British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Score A or B","timeFrame":"From screening up to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Atacicept 75 mg","deltaMin":57.32,"sd":null},{"arm":"Atacicept 150 mg","deltaMin":36.11,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":53.25,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.518"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":113,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Bulgaria","Croatia","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","India","Israel","Latvia","Lebanon","Lithuania","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","Philippines","Poland","Russia","Serbia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37332136","36532058","24951103"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":30,"n":157},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Urinary tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Injection site reaction"]}}
