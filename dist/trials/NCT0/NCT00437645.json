The study evaluated both the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments by providing data that assessed blood pressure and the proportion of patients developing peripheral edema.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to Week 8","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Valsartan/Amlodipine 160/5 mg","deltaMin":-8.01,"sd":0.5944},{"arm":"Amlodipine 10 mg","deltaMin":-6.3,"sd":0.6088}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Argentina","Chile","Ecuador","Finland","France","Germany","Italy","Norway","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19196360"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":592},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Headache"]}}
