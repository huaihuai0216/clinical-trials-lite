WR 279,396 is an antibiotic preparation that contains paromomycin + gentamicin. This cream will be compared to the effect of a topical cream containing paromomycin alone and to a placebo cream that contains no antibiotics. Therefore, this study will have three groups of patients, and they will be assigned to one of these treatments randomly. The study will be carried out without the patient or the physician knowing which cream is being used for which patient. The goal is to determine if WR 279,396 cream or the paromomycin cream is better than placebo, and if WR 279,396 is better than paromomycin alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Final Clinical Cure Rate","timeFrame":"Day 42, 98, and 168","effectByArm":[{"arm":"WR 279,396 Topical Treament","deltaMin":101,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paromomycin Alone Topical Treatment","deltaMin":102,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vehicle Placebo Cream","deltaMin":73,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.871"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Tunisia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23388004"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":125},"commonTop":["Application site vesicles","Skin irritation","Application site erythema","Superinfection","Bronchitis"]}}
