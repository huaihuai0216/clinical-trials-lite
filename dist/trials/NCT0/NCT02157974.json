It is unclear if this is related to high testosterone or insulin resistance. The investigators will assess hepatic glucose release, rates of lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis in the fasted and postprandial state to determine if alterations in the processes contribute to hepatic steatosis. Participants will be overweight, sedentary girls with or without PCOS. Those with PCOS will either be medication naive, or must be taking metformin or combined oral contraceptives (COCPs) for a period of at least 6 months prior to study procedures.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hepatic Glucose Release","timeFrame":"Measured up to 4 months from enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":1.85,"sd":1.24},{"arm":"PCOS Medication Naive","deltaMin":1.46,"sd":0.21},{"arm":"PCOS, Medication Naive + Byetta","deltaMin":1.54,"sd":0.38},{"arm":"PCOS on COCPs","deltaMin":1.88,"sd":0.49},{"arm":"PCOS on Metformin","deltaMin":1.57,"sd":0.07}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31301251","30888398"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":[]}}
