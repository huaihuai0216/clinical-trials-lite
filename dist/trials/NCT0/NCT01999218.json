The primary hypothesis of this study is that after 52 weeks, the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in participants treated with the addition of ertugliflozin 15 mg once daily is non-inferior compared with that in participants treated with the addition of glimepiride.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) at Week 52: Excluding Rescue Approach","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 5 mg","deltaMin":-0.56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 15 mg","deltaMin":-0.64,"sd":null},{"arm":"Glimepiride","deltaMin":-0.74,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["30760125","32648108","32372382","32324082","32324065","32236732","31797522","29282633"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":445},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Urinary tract infection","Headache","Common cold","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
