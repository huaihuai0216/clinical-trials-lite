This increase in immunosuppression puts this group at risk for drug-related toxicities and complications such as post-transplant diabetes.\n\nThis study will evaluate:\n\n1. Whether a sirolimus based steroid avoidance regimen in African Americans may decrease the risks of drug-related toxicities,\n2. Decreased rates of metabolic complications such as post-transplant diabetes,\n3. The effect of Sirolimus plus a reduced dose cyclosporine on renal allograft function.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cumulative One-year Acute Rejection Rates","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sirolimus, Steroid Avoidance Arm","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.28"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":44},"commonTop":[]}}
