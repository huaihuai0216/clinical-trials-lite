Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ system dysfunction. The purpose of this non-inferiority study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GA-GCB (velaglucerase alfa) administered every other week in comparison to imiglucerase in treatment naive patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline to Month 9 in Hemoglobin (Hgb) Concentration for Each Treatment Group.","timeFrame":"Baseline to Month 9","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gene-Activated Human Glucocerebrosidase (GA-GCB)","deltaMin":1.624,"sd":0.223},{"arm":"Imiglucerase","deltaMin":1.488,"sd":0.281}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States","Argentina","India","Israel","Paraguay","Russia","Spain","Tunisia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27839979"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":17},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Influenza","Headache","Pyrexia","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
