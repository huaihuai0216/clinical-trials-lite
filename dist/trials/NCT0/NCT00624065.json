Subjects will be randomized to receive either carvedilol CR + lisinopril or lisinopril + placebo. Subjects will be uptitrated over a 6 week period until target blood pressure (\\<140/90mmHg) is met. The primary objective of the study is to compare the proportion of subjects who achieve target blood pressure after 6 weeks of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Mean Sitting Cuff Blood Pressure <140/90 mmHg at the End of 6 Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"Week 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lisinopril","deltaMin":139,"sd":null},{"arm":"Carvedilol CR + Lisinopril","deltaMin":137,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.8822"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":76,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Cough","Headache","Dizziness","Nausea"]}}
