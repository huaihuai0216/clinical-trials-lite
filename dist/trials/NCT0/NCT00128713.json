The four most important secondary endpoints will compare the three study arms with respect to the following outcomes: 1) platelet utilization rates (total number of platelets transfused x 10 \\^11); 2) number of platelet transfusion events (frequency of transfusions); a transfusion event would be defined as each separate platelet transfusion issued by the study site's transfusion service; 3) highest category of bleeding during time of study (Platelet Dose Trial Bleeding Scale Grades less than or equal to 1, 2, 3, or 4 by arm); and 4) bleeding severity based on number of days with bleeding (total days of bleeding and bleeding/thrombocytopenic day), intensity of bleeding, and number of sites with bleeding (if such a severity score has been validated and published by the time the study is completed).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"At Least One Day With Grade 2 or Higher Bleeding","timeFrame":"From randomization until the subject ends the study (10 days after most recent platelet transfusion, 30 days after first platelet transfusion on study, or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lower Dose Platelets","deltaMin":304,"sd":null},{"arm":"Medium Dose Platelets","deltaMin":293,"sd":null},{"arm":"Higher Dose Platelets","deltaMin":299,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.83"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.83"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.66"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28679741","22538854","22496156","20164484"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":453},"commonTop":["Fever","Allergic Reaction/Hypersensitivity","Rigors, chills","Sinus Tachycardia","Hypertension"]}}
