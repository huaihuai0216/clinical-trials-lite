Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of eflornithine and sulindac may prevent colorectal cancer. It is not yet known whether eflornithine and sulindac are more effective than a placebo in preventing colorectal cancer","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Detection of Any Adenoma at the End of the Study","timeFrame":"Up to 36 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Eflornithine and Sulindac)","deltaMin":17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Placebo)","deltaMin":53,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20538001"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":191},"commonTop":["DIARRHEA","FATIGUE","HEADACHE","NAUSEA","COLD SYMPTOMS"]}}
