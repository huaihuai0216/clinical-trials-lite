MelaFind® acquires digital images of the lesion with illumination in different spectral bands, from visible to near infrared, and automatically analyzes these images. Diagnostic accuracy of MelaFind® and that of study dermatologists will be evaluated. The reference standard will be final interpretation of lesions by central dermatohistopathology.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sensitivity and Specificity","timeFrame":"Within 120 days of Data Lock","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Biopsied Pigmented Skin Lesions","deltaMin":98.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.05"},{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.02"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20956633"],"seeAlso":["http://www.eosciences.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1383},"commonTop":[]}}
