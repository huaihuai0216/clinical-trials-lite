This research study is designed to determine whether a higher dose of radiation will decrease the likelihood that the tumor will grow back, compared to the probability of re-growth that occurs after standard radiation doses.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival","timeFrame":"5, 10, 15 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard Treatment","deltaMin":91,"sd":null},{"arm":"Higher Dose Treatment","deltaMin":91,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.234"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".820"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".061"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":22},"commonTop":["Skin changes","Fatigue","Alopecia","Headache","Nausea"]}}
