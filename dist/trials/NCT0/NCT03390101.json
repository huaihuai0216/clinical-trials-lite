The toxicity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of BCD-085 were investigated in animals, in phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers, and in phase III clinical study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This clinical study aims at investigating the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 every other week regimen (after induction for the first 3 weeks) versus BCD-085 one per month regimen (after induction for first 3 weeks) versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\n\nStudy purpose:\n\nTo investigate the efficacy and safety of BCD-085 versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris)\n\nStudy objectives:\n\n1. To compare the efficacy of BCD-085 every 2 weeks versus BCD-085 every 4 weeks versus placebo, based on the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI75, target sPGA score, and on other secondary efficacy measures.\n2. To evaluate the proportion of patients in each study arm who develop adverse events with multiple injections of BCD-085 and placebo. Compare the safety profiles of BCD-085 when used every 4 weeks and when used every 2 weeks.\n3. 4\\. To assess the immunogenicity of BCD-085 defined as the proportion of patients who develop anti-drug antibodies (binding or neutralizing).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"â€¢ The Proportion (Number) of Patients in Each Study Arm Who Achieved a PASI 75 at Week 12 of Treatment","timeFrame":"week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BCD-085 Q2W","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"BCD-085 Q4W","deltaMin":70,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34060012"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":85},"commonTop":["Hyperbilirubinemia","Neutropenia","Leukopenia","Hyperglycaemia","Proteinuria"]}}
