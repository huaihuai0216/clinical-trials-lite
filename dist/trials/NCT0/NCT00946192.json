The second aim of this study is to determine whether transdermal or oral estrogen (versus no estrogen) is effective in increasing bone density and improving bone microarchitecture in adolescent athletes who are not getting their periods and are thus estrogen deficient. The investigators hypothesize that transdermal estrogen will be more effective than oral estrogen or no estrogen in improving bone health in amenorrheic adolescent athletes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Lumbar Bone Mineral Density","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Estrogen Patch","deltaMin":0.025,"sd":0.011},{"arm":"Estrogen Pill","deltaMin":0.008,"sd":0.011},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":0.012,"sd":0.012}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.039"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"14 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31603998","30639922","30476179","30301734","28297591","22252944","21816790"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":43},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Breast tenderness","Bloating","Worsening depression"]}}
