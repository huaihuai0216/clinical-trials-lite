This is a sub-study that includes all screened patients positive for cell cycle gene alterations which can cause tumor cells to grow more quickly. Palbociclib may slow cell cycle progression and may be able to shrink tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Objective Response Rate (Confirmed and Unconfirmed, Complete and Partial)","timeFrame":"From date of registration to progression or treatment discontinuation, up to 2 years and 10 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Palbociclib","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":32,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1065,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":32},"commonTop":["Anemia","Fatigue","White blood cell decreased","Lymphocyte count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased"]}}
