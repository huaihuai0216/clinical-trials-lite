The aim of this trial is to compare NN1250 (insulin degludec (IDeg)) with insulin glargine (IGlar) in subjects with type 2 diabetes never treated with insulin followed by the extension trial investigating the long-term safety and tolerability in terms of comparing NN1250 with insulin glargine in subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n\nAll oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) treatment will be discontinued when trial participant enters the main trial (NN1250-3579) with the exception of metformin and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor treatment (only in countries where DPP-IV inhibitor treatment is approved for combination treatment together with insulin, otherwise DPP-IV inhibitor treatment is also discontinued). Subjects who consent to participate in the extension trial will continue the treatment (NN1250 or insulin glargine + oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs)) to which they were randomly allocated in the 52 week main trial.\n\nThe main period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as NN1250-3579 while the extension period is registered as NN1250-3643.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Main Trial (Primary Endpoint): Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) After 52 Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"Week 0, Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IDeg OD","deltaMin":-1.06,"sd":1.01},{"arm":"IGlar OD","deltaMin":-1.19,"sd":0.97}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":187,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Norway","Puerto Rico","Serbia and Montenegro","Serbia","Slovenia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23130654","24170235","26121451","26232910","26663320","23952326"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":116,"n":766},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Diarrhoea","Back pain","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
