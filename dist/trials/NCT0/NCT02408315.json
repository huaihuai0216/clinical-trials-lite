Thus, the investigators have both efficacy and a safety primary outcomes.\n\nThe secondary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic(PK) parameters with these two routes of administration in a sub-cohort of this trial. The long term objective of this line of research is to inform providers' clinical decision making for the large number of women having labor induction. By providing robust PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation, clinical outcomes data for these two routes of administration, clinicians will be informed for evidence-based decisions about the preferred route of administration of misoprostol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Delivery","timeFrame":"from study entry until delivery- anticipated 3 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Buccal Misoprostol/Vaginal Placebo","deltaMin":28.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vaginal Misoprostol/Buccal Placebo","deltaMin":20.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.663"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"14 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17877674","35587540","31075246"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":148},"commonTop":["Any Maternal or Fetal Event"]}}
