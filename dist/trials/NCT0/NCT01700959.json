To examine the efficacy of melatonin treatment on neurocognitive functioning in adult survivors of childhood cancer.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the efficacy of melatonin treatment on delayed sleep onset latency in long-term childhood cancer survivors.\n2. To investigate whether improvement in sleep onset latency due to melatonin treatment is associated with neurocognitive improvement in long-term childhood cancer survivors.\n\nThis study is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of time release melatonin for adult survivors of childhood cancer who demonstrate impaired neurocognitive functioning and/or difficulty falling asleep.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Neurocognitive Function as Measured by Performance on Standardized Tests of Attention, Memory, and Executive Function.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months after start of therapy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Melatonin: NI Without DSOL","deltaMin":0.35,"sd":1.02},{"arm":"Placebo: NI Without DSOL","deltaMin":0.18,"sd":0.87},{"arm":"Melatonin: NI With DSOL","deltaMin":0.06,"sd":1.11},{"arm":"Placebo: NI With DSOL","deltaMin":0.37,"sd":0.96}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.stjude.org","http://www.stjude.org/protocols"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":58},"commonTop":["Headache","Somnolence","Fatigue","Incomnia","Diarrhea"]}}
