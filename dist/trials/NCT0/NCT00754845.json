Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. It is not yet known whether letrozole is more effective than a placebo in treating in women with breast cancer who have already received 5 years of aromatase inhibitor therapy.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying letrozole to see how well it works compared with a placebo in treating women with primary breast cancer who have received 5 years of aromatase inhibitor therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-free Survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"Unitil the end of study with a median follow up of 75 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Letrozole","deltaMin":0.95,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.91,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"0 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":43,"countries":["Canada","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27264120","34825307","33853037","29328860"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":959},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Hot flashes/ flushes","Fatigue","Arthritis","Insomnia"]}}
