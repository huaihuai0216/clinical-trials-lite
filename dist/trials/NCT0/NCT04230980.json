Research study results have shown that the use of anti-inflammatories in the peri-operative period reduces both pain and narcotic use. The hypothesis is that adding another agent in the multi-modal pathway will further reduce pain and potentially reduce narcotic usage.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Score as Measured by the NRS-11 Scale","timeFrame":"Post-operative day 0 (the day of surgery, after surgery was completed) through post-operative day 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gabapentin","deltaMin":1.91,"sd":1.63},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3.05,"sd":2.68}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":36},"commonTop":["GI upset (abdominal pain, bloating, heartburn)","Paresthesia","Dizziness","Constipation","Somnolence, drowsiness"]}}
