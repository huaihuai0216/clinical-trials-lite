Another purpose of the study is to evaluate if there are differences in sleep and other side effects, such as changes in mood or loss of appetite, which can occur with stimulant medications. A third purpose is to determine if there are differences in the characteristics of individuals who respond better to either of the medications.\n\nThis research is being done because the investigators do not know if one of these two commonly used treatments is better tolerated than the other. Children and adolescents with ADHD often have a hard time sitting still, playing quietly, finishing things they start, paying attention, waiting their turn, and not distracting others. These medications improve these symptoms, but sometimes affect sleep, appetite, or mood.\n\nIt is hypothesized that at effective and frequently prescribed doses, Adderall will be associated with insomnia, more stimulant side effects, and decreased tolerability during an acute trial relative to Focalin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sleep Start Time, and End Time as Determined by Actigraph and Sleep Diary Over 8 Weeks.","timeFrame":"8-10 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2249,"sd":12.19},{"arm":"10mg of Either Focalin XR or Adderall XR","deltaMin":2304,"sd":10.4},{"arm":"20mg of Either Focalin XR or Adderall XR","deltaMin":2319,"sd":12.21},{"arm":"25/30mg of Either Focalin XR or Adderall XR","deltaMin":2325,"sd":11.17},{"arm":"Adderall XR All Dose Levels","deltaMin":2309,"sd":11.05},{"arm":"Focalin XR All Dose Levels","deltaMin":2309,"sd":11.19}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["9204677","16601646","12025432","10103335","14595084","22136094","25056567"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":48},"commonTop":["Nail biting","Loss of Appetite","Insomnia or trouble sleeping","Irritable","Talk less"]}}
