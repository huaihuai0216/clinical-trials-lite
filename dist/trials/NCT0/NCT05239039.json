This program provides a medicine called spesolimab to people with a GPP flare-up who have no alternative treatment options. This means that no therapy exists and participation in a clinical study is not possible.\n\nParticipants get a single infusion of spesolimab into a vein. They can get another spesolimab infusion one week after the first infusion if the doctors think it is helpful.\n\nParticipants are in the program for about 4 months and visit the study site about 5 times. Participants who benefit from the treatment during that time may repeat the treatment in case they experience a new GPP flare-up. The doctors regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Occurrence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"From initial drug administration to: end of study treatment + residual effect period or end of study visit.
