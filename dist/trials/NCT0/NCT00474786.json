These investigational drugs will be administered in 6-week cycles for the duration of the study, up to 24 months. Subjects will be stratified by nephrectomy status, duration of response to sunitinib therapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic group, and RCC tumor histology.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 24 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Temsirolimus","deltaMin":4.28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sorafenib","deltaMin":3.91,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1933"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":128,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Canada","Chile","China","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Netherlands","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28410911","27238653","24297950"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=3066K1-404&StudyName=Temsirolimus%20Versus%20Sorafenib%20As%20Second-Line%20Therapy%20In%20Patients%20With%20Advanced%20RCC%20%20Who%20Have%20Failed%20First-Line%20Sunitinib"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":104,"n":249},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Rash","Fatigue","Decreased appetite","Nausea"]}}
