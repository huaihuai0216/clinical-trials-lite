This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new medicine) and people taking \"dummy\" medicine. In addition to taking the study medicine, the participant will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more physically active and what else the participant can do to lose weight. Overweight and obesity is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, weight loss has shown to have a beneficial impact on the blood sugar levels. The participant will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment the participant get is decided by chance. The participant will need to take 2 injections at the same time once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study will last for about 1.5 years","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight (%) - Semaglutide 2.4 mg Versus Placebo","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0) to week 68","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-9.9,"sd":8},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-3.3,"sd":5.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":147,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Canada","Germany","Greece","India","Japan","Puerto Rico","Russia","South Africa","Spain","United Arab Emirates","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32441473","33667417","39226070","36801984","30122305"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":402},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Vomiting","Constipation"]}}
