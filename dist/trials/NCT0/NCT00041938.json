All randomized patients have completed their follow up. All study related procedure as per the protocol has been completed. We are now in the extension phase of the study to obtain more patient data to address further aims of the study. No new procedures are performed and data already in place at the sites will be collected (EKG and echocardiograms).\n\nThe aims for this study extension are:\n\n* To assess progression of cardiac dysfunction over time among heart failure patients\n* To correlate prognosis with cardiac dysfunction","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event Rate Per 100 Patient Years for Composite Endpoint of Ischemic Stroke, Intracerebral Hemorrhage, or Death","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until the date of the first to occur of ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or death, up to 6 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aspirin","deltaMin":7.93,"sd":null},{"arm":"Warfarin","deltaMin":7.47,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.40"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":64,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38205865","31779926","28774396","27354224","26549533","25850425","25456692","23881846","22551105"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":617,"n":1163},"commonTop":["All non-serious adverse events"]}}
