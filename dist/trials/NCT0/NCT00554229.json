This trial will look at the effects of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in hormone resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.\n* All patients participating in this clinical trial will receive existing standard prostate cancer treatments in addition to trial therapy.\n* Half the patients will receive ZD4054 (Zibotentan), and half the patients will receive placebo in addition to standard prostate cancer therapy. By participating in this trial there is a 50% chance that patients will receive an agent that may slow the progression of the tumour.\n* No patients will be deprived of standard prostate cancer therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From date of randomization until date of death, assessed up to 32 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ZD4054","deltaMin":24.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":22.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":197,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":98,"n":298},"commonTop":["Oedema Peripheral","Headache","Constipation","Fatigue","Nausea"]}}
