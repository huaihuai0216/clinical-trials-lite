Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may find tumor cells and help kill them. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and radiation therapy are more effective when given together with or without bevacizumab in treating glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"From randomization to date of death or last follow-up.
