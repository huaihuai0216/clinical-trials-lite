In Chile the last national epidemiological study (2007) showed a national prevalence of dental caries in children 6 years (70.3%) and 12 (62.5%). Direct pulp capping is a preventive dental therapy, keeps the vitality of the tooth using some inductive materials mineralized tissue formation.\n\nObjective: The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two innovative direct pulp capping materials; Biodentine compared MTA and calcium hydroxide in the maintenance of pulp vitality in teeth permanent molars.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Parameters Evaluated After Treatment","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 moths and 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA)","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Calcium Hydroxide","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Biodentine","deltaMin":25,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Chile"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20478462","22251035","23683272"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":[]}}
