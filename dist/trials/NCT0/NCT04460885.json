Participants will either get insulin icodec that participants will have to inject once a week on the same day of the week or insulin glargine that participants will have to inject once a day at the same time every day. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance.\n\nThe insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm or stomach. The study will last for about 1 ½ years. Participants will have 37 clinic visits and 26 phone calls with the study doctor. At 11 clinic visits participant will have blood samples taken. At 8 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit.\n\nParticipants will be asked to wear a sensor that measures the blood sugar all the time in 5 periods of about one month during the study (about 5 months in total). Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Icodec","deltaMin":-1.55,"sd":0.06},{"arm":"Insulin Glargine","deltaMin":-1.35,"sd":0.05}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":140,"countries":["United States","Croatia","India","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Poland","Puerto Rico","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36106652","40465144","40186685","39374601","39368488","39344833","37356066"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":64,"n":492},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nasopharyngitis","Back pain","Diabetic retinopathy","Diarrhoea"]}}
