Symptomatic OLP is painful and complete healing is rare. Current treatments for lichen planus and lichenoid mucositis are usually directed towards reducing the symptoms.\n\nThis double-blinded cross-over placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to measure the effectiveness of a topical NSAID (Ibuprofen suspension - 100mg/5ml) compared with a placebo in reducing pain associated with Oral Lichen Planus and Oral Lichenoid Lesions.\n\nExclusion criteria include:\n\n* The occurrence of dysplasia in the histopathological specimen\n* Known or suspected sensitivity to NSAID medication\n* History of asthma\n* History of gastrointestinal ulceration\n* History of bleeding disorders\n* Pregnancy\n\nOutcome measures are self-reported pain scores at day 0, day 4 and day 7 of use of the placebo or active suspension, using a horizontal 100 mm, visual analog scale (VAS). If subjects were already on active treatment at the time of enrollment, they will be asked to discontinue for 7 days for a washout period before starting the research study.\n\ncord their spontaneous pain level on a 0-10 VAS.\n\nParticipants will be contacted initially after the first day of the intervention to discuss any concerns or questions. Every week, reminder phone calls will be made to the subjects to fill out the forms from the investigator and to check for any side effects from the intervention.\n\nBoth the patient and the investigator will be blinded for the content of each bottle.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Self-reported Pain Scores Using 100m Visual Analog Scale 0-100 Pain Score.","timeFrame":"Total pain improvement over day 0 to day 7 (summation of improvement over 7 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.4,"sd":15.3},{"arm":"Ibuprofen Rinse","deltaMin":12.3,"sd":23.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":[]}}
