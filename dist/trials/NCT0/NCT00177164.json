Only 48 patients (23 in the risperidone LAI group and 25 in the oral AAP group) contributed data to the assessments. Patients were titrated and cross-tapered during a 3 month titration and stabilization phase. They were followed for an additional 12 months. Clinical outcomes such as study drop out, adverse events, worsening of symptoms, crisis interventions, need for additional medication, hospitalizations etc. were evaluated from months 3 to 15. The numbers of clinical events (pooled) will be used to evaluate if the long acting injectable form of risperidone has an advantage over the oral second generation antipsychotic agents in terms of treatment continuity and clinical stability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Evaluate the Number of Clinical Events (Pooled) Occurring Between 3-15 Months Following a Switch/Stabilization of the Antipsychotic Agents Among Patients Who Receive Either Risperidal Consta or One of the 4 Marketed 2nd Generation Antipsychotic Agents.","timeFrame":"Upto 15 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Risperidone LAI","deltaMin":0.86,"sd":0.73},{"arm":"Oral AAP","deltaMin":1.61,"sd":1.29}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25385032"],"seeAlso":["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-5215.2010.00458.x/full"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["Increased appetite","Somnolence","Weight Gain","Migraine Headache","tremors"]}}
