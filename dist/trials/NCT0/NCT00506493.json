The trial population includes patients requiring valve replacements or repairs, atrial septal defect (ASD) repairs, patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. The study objectives are to demonstrate that the Medtronic Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System can safely and effectively treat persistent AF patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy Endpoint: The Percent of Patients Off Class I or III Antiarrhythmic Drugs and Out of AF as Determined by 24 Hour Holter Recording at 9 Months","timeFrame":"9 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System","deltaMin":42.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":45,"n":75},"commonTop":["Pleural Effusion","Atelectasis","Renal Insufficiency/Failure: No Dialysis Required","Hemodynamic Instability","Anemia"]}}
