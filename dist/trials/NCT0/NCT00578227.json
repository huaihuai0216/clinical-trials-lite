Vaccination of pre-teens and adolescents, ideally before sexual debut and thus before exposure to oncogenic HPV, is a rational strategy for prevention of cervical cancer, and so HPV vaccination could complement the existing pre-adolescent/adolescent vaccination programs. Therefore, this Phase IIIb study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of co-administering a commercially available vaccine with GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 (Cervarix ®) vaccine as compared to the administration of either vaccine alone. This Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA AA, Sept 2007.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Seroconverted for Anti-hepatitis A (Anti-HAV) Antibodies","timeFrame":"At Month 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix™ & Twinrix™ Group","deltaMin":240,"sd":null},{"arm":"Twinrix™ Group","deltaMin":242,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Canada","Denmark","Hungary","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22188832"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":272},"commonTop":["Pain at injection site","Redness at injection site","Fatigue","Headache","Swelling at injection site"]}}
