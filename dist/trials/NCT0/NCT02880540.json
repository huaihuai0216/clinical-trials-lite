The prevalence of childhood obesity has rapidly increased over the past decade and is associated with multiple co-morbid disease states . It is estimated that approximately 15.5% of children and adolescents are obese with a body mass index of â‰¥95th percentile for age . This not only poses health concerns for the patient, but also places increased demands on our healthcare system that is already overwhelmed by burgeoning costs. Moreover, obese children and adolescents who maintain excessive weight as adults are predisposed to cardiovascular disease and premature death.\n\nIn carefully selected patients who have failed to lose weight by diet and exercise, bariatric surgery provides an option to obtaining a healthy weight.\n\nIt is increasingly becoming an attractive option, with the number of adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery in the United States tripling between 2000 and 2003.\n\nObese patients are often afflicted with multi-organ dysfunction and obstructive sleep apnea, which presents unique challenges to the anesthesiologist managing their perioperative care . Bariatric surgery in obese adolescents may be associated with significant postoperative pain. Potent intravenous opioids such as fentanyl and morphine are at the mainstay of perioperative pain management. Unfortunately, respiratory depression and airway obstruction can often occur following administration of opioids in obese patients . This makes providing a safe analgesic regimen difficult during the perioperative setting. As opioids can be associated with respiratory depression and upper airway obstruction, surgeons and anesthesiologists alike must reconcile the adequacy of pain control with the risk of respiratory complications after surgery in obese adolescents.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Scores (Numerical Rating Scale 0-10) Using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised","timeFrame":"From surgery until discharge from the hospital, an average of 48 hours.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dexmedetomidine Treated","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17188605","17188606","14527256","17498505","15231931","17339501","10927998","17021525","21148651","16517328","18499604","21821507"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
