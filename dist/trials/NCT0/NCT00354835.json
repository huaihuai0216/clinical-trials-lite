Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective when given together with radiation therapy in treating patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event Free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"4 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vincristine, Dactinomycin, Cyclophosphamide (VAC)","deltaMin":0.6255,"sd":null},{"arm":"VAC Alternating With Vincristine, Irinotecan (VI)","deltaMin":0.5874,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":22,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":226,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31174239","30091945"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":222},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Anemia","Platelet count decreased","Febrile neutropenia"]}}
