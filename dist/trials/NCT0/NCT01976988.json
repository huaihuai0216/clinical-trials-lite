Dis. Col. Rectum. 2006; 49: 1620-1628.)\n\nThe reported incidence of symptomatic VTE after colorectal surgery is approximately 4% (Monn, F. et al. JACS. 216; 2013: 395-401). However, the reported incidence of VTE after colorectal surgery in prospectively followed patients managed with perioperative venous thromboprophylaxis undergoing screening venography prior to hospital discharge ranges from 9 to 20% (Bergovist et al. NEJM 346; 2002: 975-980; McLeod et al. Ann. Surg. 233; 2000: 438-444; ENOXACAN Study group. Brit. J. Surg. 84; 1997: 1099-1103.\n\nThe Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) and the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guidelines recommend that venous thromboprophylaxis be initiated within 24 hours of surgery. However, it is believed that deep venous thrombosis occurs during surgery, rather than in the postoperative period, justifying preoperative initiation of venous thromboprophylaxis. This practice is accompanied with a theoretically higher risk of bleeding complications.\n\nCurrently there is no consensus on the precise timing of VTE prophylaxis after major colorectal surgery, as demonstrated by the vague guidelines established by the ACCP and SCIP. Current studies on VTE prophylaxis report preoperative initiation of VTE prophylaxis. However, majority of surgeons at our institution begin heparin postoperatively given concern for bleeding complications with preoperative dosing of heparin.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the incidence of VTE and major bleeding complications in patients undergoing major colorectal surgery who are treated with preoperative or postoperative venous thromboprophylaxis and to help establish more stringent guidelines on the optimal timing of VTE prophylaxis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Postoperative VTE Within 48 Hours After Surgery","timeFrame":"48 hour postop period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Post-op Heparin","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pre-op Heparin","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.72"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27455158"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":192},"commonTop":["gastrointestinal complications","Bleeding not requiring reoperation","Genitourinary complications","Infections treated conservatively","Cardiac events"]}}
