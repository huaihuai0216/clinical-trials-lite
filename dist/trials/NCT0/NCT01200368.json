Group 3 subjects will also receive catch-up doses of Prevenar (commercial product of Prevenar in Japan) 13vPnC and 7vPnC will be blinded, and DTaP will be open-label. The main purpose of the study is to determine if the immune responses to 13vPnC are comparable to the immune responses to 7vPnC and if the immune responses to 13vPnC given with DTaP are comparable to those induced by DTaP given alone. In addition, the study aims to evaluate the side effects (safety profile) after vaccination of 13vPnC and 7vPnC when given with DTaP in healthy Japanese infants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Serotype-specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Antibody Level Greater Than or Equal to (>=) 0.35 Microgram Per Milliliter (mcg/mL) 1 Month After the Infant Series","timeFrame":"1 month after the infant series","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC + DTaP","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"7vPnC + DTaP","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26121200"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":183},"commonTop":["Redness (Any)","Redness (Mild)","Fever >=37.5, =<39 degrees C","Upper respiratory tract infection","Swelling (Any)"]}}
