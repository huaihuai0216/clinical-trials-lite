To determine if, over time, BG00012 treatment can decrease the number of certain types of brain lesions commonly seen in MS patients and slow down the time it takes for the disease to get worse.\n\nThe purpose of this study is also to determine the safety of BG00012 and how well it is tolerated. Another goal is to see what effect BG00012 may have on tests and evaluations used to assess MS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Subjects Relapsed","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.461,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012 240 mg Twice Daily (BID)","deltaMin":0.27,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012 240 mg 3 Times Daily (TID)","deltaMin":0.26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":159,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Guatemala","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Moldova","Netherlands","New Zealand","North Macedonia","Poland","Romania","Serbia","Slovakia","South Africa","Switzerland","Ukraine","United Kingdom","Virgin Islands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32426039","30918100","28770420","28751099","27733070","26932146","26526385","26049148","25315404","24131282","22992073"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":86,"n":408},"commonTop":["MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS RELAPSE","FLUSHING","NASOPHARYNGITIS","HEADACHE","DIARRHEA"]}}
