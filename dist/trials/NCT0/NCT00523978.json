Subjects with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) referred for ablative intervention after efficacy failure of one or more Study Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Drugs (flecainide, propafenone or sotalol) were randomized 2:1 to cryoablation intervention (Experimental Subjects, ES) or to a Study AF Drug (Control Subjects, CS). Subjects were followed for 12 months with scheduled and symptom-driven assessments to detect recurrent atrial fibrillation by means of periodic electrocardiograms, weekly scheduled trans-telephonic monitoring, patient-initiated trans-telephonic monitoring, and 24-hour Holter monitoring at 6 and 12 months. The first 90 days after study therapy was initiated was considered a blanked period for all subjects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Acute Procedural Success (APS)","timeFrame":"371.4 Minutes (Average)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cryoablation","deltaMin":160,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23500312"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":163},"commonTop":["Atrial Fibrillation","Atrial Flutter","Headache","Cough","Dizziness"]}}
