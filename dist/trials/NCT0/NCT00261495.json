The study will also determine the dose of sustained-release hydromorphone that provides a level of pain control that is equal to the pain control provided by control-released oxycodone (equi-analgesic dosage).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questionnaire Item 6 \"Pain Right Now\" Score at Week 24 (Per Protocol [PP] Population)","timeFrame":"baseline and week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"OROS Hydromorphone HCl","deltaMin":-2.8,"sd":2.04},{"arm":"Oxycodone","deltaMin":-3.2,"sd":2.24}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.011"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Norway","Poland","Slovakia","Slovenia","Sweden","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20384968"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":254},"commonTop":["Nausea","Constipation","Vomiting","Fatigue","Hyperhidrosis"]}}
