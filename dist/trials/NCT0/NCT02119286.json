Subjects will then be randomized to receive any one of the 3 treatments (umeclidinium bromide \\[UMEC\\] \\[62.5 mcg\\] administered once daily via a DPI; OR UMEC \\[125 mcg\\] administered once daily via a DPI; OR matching placebo administered once daily via a DPI), while continuing treatment with open label FF/VI 100/25 mcg during a 12-week treatment period. There will be a total of eight scheduled clinic visits at Pre-Screening (Visit0), Screening (Visit 1), blinded treatment Day 1(Visit2), 2(Visit3), 28 (Visit4), 56 (Visit5), 84 (Visit6) and 85 (Visit7). A follow-up phone contact will be conducted approximately 7 days after the last clinic visit. The total duration of subject participation in the study from Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 17 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 85","timeFrame":"Day 85","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 µg + Placebo","deltaMin":-0.03,"sd":0.011},{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 µg + UMEC 62.5 µg","deltaMin":0.092,"sd":0.0107},{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 µg + UMEC 125 µg","deltaMin":0.081,"sd":0.0106}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":27,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":57,"countries":["United States","Czechia","Germany","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":206},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Back pain"]}}
