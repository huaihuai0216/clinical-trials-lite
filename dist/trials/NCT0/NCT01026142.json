The study population consisted of female patients, whose disease had progressed during or following previous trastuzumab therapy for metastatic disease. All patients in Arm A and Arm B received trastuzumab (8 mg/kg iv as loading dose and then 6 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks thereafter) and capecitabine oral twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks (1250 mg/m2 twice daily in Arm A and 1000 mg/m2 twice daily in Arm B). In addition, patients in Arm B received pertuzumab (840 mg iv as loading dose and then 420 mg iv thereafter) every 3 weeks. Study treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (Independent Assessment)","timeFrame":"Tumor assessments every 9 weeks from randomization until Week 27, then every 12 weeks thereafter, until IRF-determined PD, initiation of alternative anticancer medication, or death (up to 5.5 years).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A: Capecitabine + Trastuzumab","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"B: Capecitabine + Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab","deltaMin":11.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0731"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":190,"countries":["Argentina","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":218},"commonTop":["Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysaesthesia Syndrome","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Asthenia","Fatigue"]}}
