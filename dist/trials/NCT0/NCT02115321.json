The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of HCV-infected participants with hepatic insufficiency (the CP-B population) achieving sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of all treatment (SVR12) will be greater than 60%. Additionally, ten non-cirrhotic (NC) HCV-infected GT1 participants will also be given GZR + EBR at the beginning of the study; this will be done for the purpose of collecting plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) data in HCV GT1-infected participants who do not have hepatic insufficiency.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Viral Response 12 Weeks After Completing Study Therapy (SVR12)","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part A: CP-B GZR 50 mg + EBR 50 mg","deltaMin":90,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part A: NC GZR 100 mg + ER 50 mg","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["30939489"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":30},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Headache","Arthralgia","Nausea","Abdominal pain"]}}
