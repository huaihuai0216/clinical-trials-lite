It is characterized by an enlargement of the prostate occurring in human male over the age of 50 which increases in prevalence with age, and among those aged 50 to 80, about 40% report moderate or severe urinary symptoms of prostatism. The aim of treatment is to improve patients' quality of life which primarily depends on the severity of the symptoms of BPH. Current treatments of BPH have a benefit / risk ratio which leaves room for improvement.\n\nFor this study, study medication (Cetrorelix pamoate or placebo) is administered by injection in the buttocks (Intramuscular). All patients completing the double-blind portion (Week 0 to 52) are eligible to receive the active drug during the open-label part of the study (Week 52 to 90).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cetrorelix 78+78","deltaMin":-6.2,"sd":5.68},{"arm":"CET 78+Placebo","deltaMin":-5.1,"sd":5.18},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-5.7,"sd":6.04}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.371"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.3253"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0333"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["Belarus","Bulgaria","Czechia","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","North Macedonia","Romania","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":212},"commonTop":["Influenza"]}}
