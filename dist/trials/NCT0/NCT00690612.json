The study is open label with no concurrent control group. To be eligible for HIP, children must have completed Study 328 without discontinuation due to a study drug-related AE and in the investigator's opinion, have an on-going clinical indication for an orally administered suspension of candesartan cilexetil to control blood pressure. Children will return to clinic every 3 months (more frequently at the investigator's discretion) for safety and efficacy evaluations. Safety will be monitored by serum chemistries, urinalyses, echocardiograms and by physical examinations at specified clinic visits. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at each clinic visit. Study drug is administered orally once a day. Investigators determine the efficacious dose ( 0.05 mg/kg; 0.2 mg/kg; 0.4 mg/kg) on a vist-by-vist basis depending on the child's BP response. It is anticipated that study dose will align closely with the effective anti-hypertensive dose determined in Study 328. If the child's hypertension is not well-controlled, dose adjustments up to a maximum of 0.4mg/kg/day and/or the addition of other antihypertensive medications are permitted, with the exception of other angiotensin receptor blockers. The HIP study offers eligible children up to two additional years of treatment with the liquid formulation of Atacand.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline to Final Visit in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP).","timeFrame":"Every 3 months- baseline to final visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Atacand Candesartan Cilexetil","deltaMin":-2.86,"sd":11.97}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["Belgium","France","Germany","Italy","Poland","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":35},"commonTop":["PYREXIA","Diarrhoea","PHARYNGITIS","RHINITIS","COUGH"]}}
