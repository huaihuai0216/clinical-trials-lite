It results from accumulation of plaque on the surface of the teeth and biochemical activities of complex microorganisms. Streptococcus mutans is one of the main pathogens of dental caries. Although brushing has the potential to maintain adequate levels of oral hygiene, studies demonstrate that such methods are not being employed sufficiently. The need for additional help in controlling bacterial plaque provides the rationale for patients using mouth rinses as adjuncts. Chlorhexidine although considered the gold standard, its side effects due to prolonged use such as staining of teeth, dry mouth, altered taste sensation, mouth/ throat irritation, etc indicates the need for alternatives.\n\nProbiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotic technology represents a breakthrough approach to maintaining oral health by utilizing natural beneficial bacteria commonly found in healthy mouths to provide a natural defense against those bacteria thought to be harmful to teeth and gums. The advantages of using a probiotic mouth rinse are that it contains friendly microbes, there is no issue of antibiotic resistance, and there are no known/proven toxicities caused due to their use.\n\nXylitol is a non-sugar sweetener permitted for use in foods. Xylitol is a naturally occurring non-cariogenic sugar substitute that cannot be metabolized by oral bacteria. This possesses various properties favorable for caries prevention.It acts by forming of loosely attached biofilms on the tooth surfaces that can be easily removed. Although many studies have evaluated the effects of xylitol chewing gum on caries prevention, there are very few examining the effect of xylitol mouth rinse on oral Streptococcus mutans. Hence xylitol mouth rinse may be introduced as a possible alternative.\n\nAntimicrobial efficacies of probiotics and xylitol mouth rinses have not been compared till date. Also their effects on the young and elderly population have not been compared. Hence the purpose of the study is to compare the antimicrobial efficacies of probiotic \\& xylitol mouth rinses with that of chlorhexidine in children and elderly population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Streptococcus Mutans Levels in Dental Plaque","timeFrame":"Assessment of change in Streptococcus mutans levels 14 days after intervention","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A (Chlorhexidine Mouthrinse)","deltaMin":3.11,"sd":2.32},{"arm":"Group B (Xylitol Mouth Rinse)","deltaMin":0.93,"sd":0.86},{"arm":"Group C (Probiotic Mouth Rinse)","deltaMin":1.91,"sd":1.67}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.123"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.314"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35968060"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["irritation of oral mucosa (burning sensation in the mouth and tongue)"]}}
