In this open-label phase II clinical trial, we are proposing to enroll 32 recovering alcoholic smokers who are motivated to stop smoking. After the initial up titration of varenicline in week 1, all 32 subjects will receive a total of 2 mg/day of varenicline for 12 weeks. In addition to receiving varenicline, all subjects will receive brief behavioral counseling and our standard intervention at each visit during participation in the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Biochemically Confirmed Abstinence From Smoking","timeFrame":"12 weeks from start of medication","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Varenicline","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20947286"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":["Nausea","Sleep Disturbance","Abnormal Dreams","Depression/Anxiety","other gastrointestinal"]}}
