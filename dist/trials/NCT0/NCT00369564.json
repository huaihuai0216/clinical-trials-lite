It is not yet known whether glutamic acid is more effective than a placebo in preventing nerve damage in patients receiving vincristine for Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying glutamic acid to see how well it works compared to a placebo in reducing nerve damage caused by vincristine in young patients receiving vincristine for Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Neurotoxicity as Measured by a Scored Neurologic Examination at Baseline, 5 Weeks, and 10 Weeks (if Applicable)","timeFrame":"10 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I Glutamic Acid","deltaMin":26,"sd":4.4},{"arm":"Arm II Placebo","deltaMin":34,"sd":4.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":127},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Pain"]}}
