The investigators plan to see which fluid is better, and to see if they have a role in improving a patient's recovery time, reducing complications and the length of time they stay in hospital. This study plans to find out if there is evidence that one fluid is better overall to determine the need for a subsequent definitive trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Recruitment Rate","timeFrame":"Approx 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"5% Human Albumin Solution","deltaMin":150,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intravenous Balanced Crystalloid","deltaMin":150,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38912884"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":150},"commonTop":["Investigations","Blood and Lymphatic","General disorders and administration","Metabolism and nutrition disorders","Cardiac Disorders"]}}
