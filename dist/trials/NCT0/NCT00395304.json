While a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may effectively control symptoms, some children may require additional medications to maintain adequate asthma control. This study compares the effectiveness of a higher dose of ICS, ICS combined with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) medication, and ICS combined with a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) medication at reducing the impact and severity of asthma exacerbations that occur in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Number of Participants With a Differential Response to the Three Step-up Therapies Based on Fixed Threshold Criteria for the Following Three Asthma Control Measures: Use of Oral Prednisone for Acute Asthma Exacerbations, Asthma Control Days and FEV1.","timeFrame":"Measured during the last 12 weeks of each 16-week treatment period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All Participants","deltaMin":161,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20197425"],"seeAlso":["http://www.asthma-carenet.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":182},"commonTop":["asthma exacerbation not requiring hospitalization"]}}
