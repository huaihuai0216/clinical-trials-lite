The object is to evaluate whether acupuncture is effective for functional constipation. As an explanatory research, it took one single point as its intervention and sham acupuncture as its control group (patients were blinded). On the basis of its confirmed effect, we are taking a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to further evaluate whether acupuncture is more effective than routine treatment. Acupuncture prescriptions used in this trial are individually prescribed according to syndrome differentiation, which can improve clinical effect. .","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change of the SBMs From Baseline at Week 4","timeFrame":"baseline and at 4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Acupuncture at ST25 and BL25","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Acupuncture at LI11 and ST37","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Acupuncture at ST25, BL25, LI11 and ST37","deltaMin":2.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Medicine","deltaMin":2.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.352"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22759406"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":168},"commonTop":["Common cold","Joint pains","Eye discomfort","Irregular menstruation","Fundus hemorrhage"]}}
