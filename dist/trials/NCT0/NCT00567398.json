In a subgroup of patients, the impact of glucose-sparing PD solutions (PEN vs Dianeal only) on abdominal fat and left ventricular (LV) structure and function will be assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From the Baseline Value in HbA1c at Month 3 and 6","timeFrame":"Baseline, Month 3, Month 6 (End of Study)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Non-Glucose Sparing Prescriptions","deltaMin":0.2,"sd":1.1},{"arm":"Glucose Sparing Prescriptions","deltaMin":-0.6,"sd":1.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["Australia","Canada","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["10433550","9848629","10911641","16221697","1202618","15980620"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":127},"commonTop":["Peritonitis","Hypertension","Peritonitis Bacterial","Fluid Overload","Anaemia"]}}
