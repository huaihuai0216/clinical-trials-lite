Many people use inhaled corticosteroid medications to treat their symptoms. These medications, however, are not effective for everyone. Clarithromycin is an antibiotic that may effectively treat asthma in these individuals. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of clarithromycin at controlling asthma symptoms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Results","timeFrame":"Measured every four weeks during the 16-week treatment period, with the change (week 16 minus baseline) as the primary outcome","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Clarithromycin + Fluticasone","deltaMin":-0.15,"sd":0.14},{"arm":"Placebo + Fluticasone","deltaMin":-0.38,"sd":0.14}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20920764"],"seeAlso":["http://www.acrn.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":47},"commonTop":["respiratory infections","gastrointestinal events"]}}
