They are then randomized between an EGFR-TK inhibitor (erlotinib) and chemotherapy (Docetaxel).\n\nIt is hypothesized that the VeriStrat test results are able to predict the benefit of treatment with erlotinib vs docetaxel. This would suggest a significant improvement in progression-free survival for VSG patients when treated with Erlotinib, and no significant improvement in VSP patients who receive the same treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"The combined run in period, treatment and follow-up for PFS is expected to extend the study duration to a total of 24 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A: Erlotinib","deltaMin":1.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"B: Docetaxel","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Denmark","Greece","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19273711","10811675","16014882","17551144","17909350","15774793","1100130"],"seeAlso":["http://www.etop-eu.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":38},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Dyspnea","Rash maculo-papular","Cough","Diarrhea"]}}
