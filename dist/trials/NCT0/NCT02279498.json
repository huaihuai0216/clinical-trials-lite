The purpose of the present study is to provide additional efficacy and safety data compared to approved, porcine-derived, enterically-coated and encapsulated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will be comparative efficacy measured as the change in the coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) in Cystic Fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).\n\nLiprotamase is stable in stomach and digestive fluids allowing administration in a variety of convenient formulations and with a number of foods without enteric coating.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Difference in Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA) Change From Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline, 7 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Difference","deltaMin":-11.852,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":54,"countries":["United States","Canada","Czechia","Hungary","Israel","Poland","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32761612"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":65},"commonTop":["Infective pulmonary exacerbation","Respiratory tract infection","Cough","Headache","Abnormal loss of weight"]}}
