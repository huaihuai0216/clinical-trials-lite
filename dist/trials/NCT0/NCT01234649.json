GDM is often the culmination of years of unrecognized and unmodified diabetes risk factors that lead to overt and occult clinical manifestations during pregnancy. Systematic reviews of older studies conclude that 35-60% women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes (DM2) at rates much greater than control groups who did not have glucose intolerance during pregnancy. Liraglutide may potentially delay disease progression in GDM considering the beta -(ß-)cell function improvement in DM2 and ß-cell mass shown to increase in animal models. This study will examine if the addition of liraglutide to metformin therapy is more effective than metformin alone in improving insulin sensitivity and normalizing insulin secretion in at-risk overweight/obese women with prior GDM.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index (IS-SI)","timeFrame":"84 weeks of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin XR Plus Liraglutide","deltaMin":418.4,"sd":387},{"arm":"Metformin XR Plus Placebo","deltaMin":333,"sd":206}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.04"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32046931"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":78},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhea","Allergic reaction to liraglutide"]}}
