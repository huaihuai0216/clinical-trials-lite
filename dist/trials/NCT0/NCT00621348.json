An important reason for this high incidence could be use of hypotonic fluids in sick children for maintenance fluid therapy. There are no randomized controlled trials to evaluate the effect of various types of intravenous fluids on the incidence of hyponatremia in sick hospitalized children.\n\nHypothesis: Use of normal saline in 5% dextrose or reduced (2/3) volume of N/5 saline in 5% dextrose reduces incidence of hyponatremia (serum sodium 130 mmol/L) by two-thirds when compared to N/5 saline in 5% dextrose at standard maintenance rate in hospitalized children receiving intravenous maintenance fluids.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Hyponatremia (Defined as Serum Sodium Less Than 130 mmol/L)","timeFrame":"72 hrs","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dextrose Normal Saline","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluid Restriction Group","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Hypotonic Saline","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20668885"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":58},"commonTop":["Hypernatremia"]}}
