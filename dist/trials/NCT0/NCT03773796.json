Nabilone is an analogue of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. Nabilone acts as a partial agonist on both Cannabinoid 1 (CB1) and Cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor in humans and therefore mimics the effect of THC but with more predictable side effects and less euphoria.\n\nEligible patients will be re-tapered in an open-label nabilone dose optimization phase followed by an open-label period of 6 months on a stable nabilone dose.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"AEs in PD Patients Taking Nabilone, Between V 1 and V 3","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Group","deltaMin":39,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Austria"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":22},"commonTop":["respiratory tract infection","intermittant falls","Concentration difficulties","transient numbness of the face","Osteopenia"]}}
