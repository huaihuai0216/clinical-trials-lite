These mutations result in the body's overproduction of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a protein that stimulates the inflammatory process. IL-1 Trap (rilonacept) was designed to bind to the interleukin-1 cytokine and prevent it from binding to its receptors in the body.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week-6 (Part A) Endpoint in Mean Key Symptom Score (KSS)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Days -21 to -1) and Week 6 (Days 21-42)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.4,"sd":1.5},{"arm":"Rilonacept 160 mg","deltaMin":3.1,"sd":1.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23031624","18668535"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18668535?ordinalpos=13&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":104},"commonTop":["Injection Site Reaction","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Diarrhea","Nausea","Sinusitis"]}}
