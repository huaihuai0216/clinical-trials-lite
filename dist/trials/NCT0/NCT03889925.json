This has led to the development of additional injection options such as autologous derived blood products which have been documented to alleviate symptoms related to knee osteoarthritis, with recent comparative studies suggesting a greater, long-lasting effect with these blood derived products like platelet rich plasma (PRP) \\[2-8\\]. One clinically-developed preparation of platelet rich plasma, named autologous conditioned plasma (ACP), has randomized controlled trial data proving efficacy \\[4,9\\]. Clinical use of platelet rich plasma for knee arthritis typically involves a 3-injection series over 3 weeks, i.e. an injection once a week for three weeks. The main objective of this study is to determine if hyaluronic acid (HA) injected at the same time as autologous conditioned plasma (ACP), a leukocyte-poor platelet rich plasma product, will improve the performance of ACP in the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. It is hypothesized that the injection of hyaluronic acid will improve the efficacy of ACP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Western Ontario and McMaster University's Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months post injections","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Autologous Conditioned Plasma Group","deltaMin":24.9,"sd":15.6},{"arm":"Autologous Conditioned Plasma With Hyaluronic Acid Group","deltaMin":22.4,"sd":15.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24501778","21831567","23104611","23299850","22069972","23176112","24075613","26831629"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
