Participants will be, in the opinion of the Investigator, appropriate for single-agent therapy for their next line of therapy. The FRα positivity will be defined by the Ventana FOLR1 (FOLR1-2.1) CDx assay.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1","timeFrame":"From randomization until PD or death, whichever occurred first (up to approximately 36 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mirvetuximab Soravtansine","deltaMin":5.59,"sd":null},{"arm":"Investigator's Choice (IC) Chemotherapy","deltaMin":3.98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":214,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Czechia","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40179908","38055253"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":62,"n":227},"commonTop":["NAUSEA","FATIGUE","VISION BLURRED","ANAEMIA","CONSTIPATION"]}}
