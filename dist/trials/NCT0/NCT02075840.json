Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either alectinib, 600 milligrams (mg) orally twice daily (BID), or crizotinib, 250 mg orally BID. Participants will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. The study is expected to last approximately 144 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by Investigator Assessment","timeFrame":"Randomization to first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (assessed every 8 weeks up to 33 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Alectinib","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Crizotinib","deltaMin":11.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":98,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","Costa Rica","Egypt","France","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Israel","Italy","Mexico","New Zealand","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39661917","35275991","32418886","30215676","29656744","28586279","28501139"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":44,"n":152},"commonTop":["Constipation","Nausea","Diarrohea","Vomiting","Oedema Peripheral"]}}
