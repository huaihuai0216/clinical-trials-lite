ABI-007 is a new preparation of the active drug paclitaxel. It contains the same medication as the prescription chemotherapy drug Abraxane®. Abraxane® is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Dacarbazine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma. In this study, ABI-007 and Dacarbazine will be tested as therapy for people who have not yet had any cancer treatment for the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on a Blinded Radiology Assessment of Response Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines","timeFrame":"Response assessment completed every 8 weeks until disease progression for up to 106 weeks; data cut off 30 June 2012","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ABI-007 150mg/m^2","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dacarbazine 1000mg/m^2","deltaMin":2.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.044"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26410620"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":62,"n":257},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Alopecia","Constipation","Diarrhoea"]}}
