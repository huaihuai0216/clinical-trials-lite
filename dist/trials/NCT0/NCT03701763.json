Randomization to apremilast arm or placebo arm will be stratified by age group (6 to 11 years or 12 to 17 years). Subjects will receive apremilast treatment of either 20 mg twice daily (BID) or 30 mg BID, depending on weight. This Phase 3 study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of apremilast in the treatment of pediatric subjects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Response at Week 16","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":11.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Apremilast","deltaMin":33.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":99,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38266683","40737559"],"seeAlso":["http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":80},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Abdominal pain","Vomiting","Headache"]}}
