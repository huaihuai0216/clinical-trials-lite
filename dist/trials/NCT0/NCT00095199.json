Within each chemotherapy group, patients will be randomized to receive Cetuximab plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone (Cetuximab \\& Pemetrexed or Pemetrexed alone; Cetuximab \\& Docetaxel or Docetaxel alone).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Randomization to progression of disease or death due to any cause up to 59.6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cetuximab & Pemetrexed","deltaMin":2.89,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pemetrexed","deltaMin":2.76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cetuximab & Docetaxel","deltaMin":2.37,"sd":null},{"arm":"Docetaxel","deltaMin":1.54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.756"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.391"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":67,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24231627"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":119,"n":292},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Dermatitis acneiform","Nausea","Decreased appetite","Anaemia"]}}
