Participating subjects will also be asked to complete a brief (about 15 questions) oral health questionnaire.\n\nParticipating subjects will return to the clinic about 8 weeks post surgery for digital crown impressions and again at 11-13 weeks after surgery for crown placement. Participating subjects will also return to clinic at 1 year after implant placement for implant evaluation. At this final study appointment, x-rays and a 3D intraoral scan will be obtained for the purpose of measuring alveolar volume. The health of the mucosa surrounding the implant and subject satisfaction will be assessed via bleeding upon probing and completion of a brief questionnaire, respectively.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Volume of Alveolar Ridge as Measured by 3D Intraoral Scanning","timeFrame":"12 months post implant surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Implant With Prophylactic Allograft","deltaMin":15.5,"sd":19},{"arm":"Implant Without Prophylactic Allograft","deltaMin":16.8,"sd":62}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":[]}}
