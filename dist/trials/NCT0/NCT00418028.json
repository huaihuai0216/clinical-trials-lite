There are theoretical reasons to administer S-phase specific agents in continuous, protracted rather than intermittent schedules. The investigators study compares the standard schedule (1250 mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks on, one week off) with a continuous administration schedule (800 mg/m2/12hr). The latter administer approximately the same cumulative dose of capecitabine as the standard schedule. The study hypothesis is that grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome will be reduced from 50% (standard arm) to 20% (experimental arm). The investigators assume similar antitumor activity in both arms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Progression","timeFrame":"After 1 year from the treatment start day.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Cint)","deltaMin":8.68,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Ccont)","deltaMin":6.84,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1224"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25601966"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":95},"commonTop":["Rash: hand-foot skin reaction","Grade 3-4 Diarrhea","Mucositis/stomatitis (functional/symptomatic)","Grade 3-4 Neutropenia","Grade 3-4 Thrombocytopenia"]}}
