Homeless adults who receive the professional coordination of individualized care (i.e., case management) during the period following their release from jail experience fewer mental health and substance use problems, are more likely to obtain stable housing, and are less likely to be re-incarcerated. The proposed study will use mobile technology to address these barriers and fill gaps in the understanding of the causes of the revolving door of homeless incarceration. This research represents a step toward integrated service connection and healthcare service provision for one of the most underserved, high need, and understudied populations in the United States. Smart phone apps that increase the use of available healthcare services and identify predictors of key outcomes (e.g., homelessness, re-arrest, medication compliance) could be used to reach hard to reach populations with histories of significant and persistent health disparities (e.g., homeless adults).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Case Management Sessions Completed","timeFrame":"6-month follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Case Management (UCM)","deltaMin":9.39,"sd":11.4},{"arm":"UCM + Smartphone","deltaMin":7.69,"sd":10.79},{"arm":"Smartphone Based Case Management (SPCM)","deltaMin":8.46,"sd":11.17}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29871852"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":136},"commonTop":[]}}
