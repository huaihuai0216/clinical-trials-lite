It will also look at how much pain participants have in participants knee from the start to the end of the study and how this affects participants daily life.

Participants will have 14 clinic visits with the study staff. At the first clinic visit participants will have a blood sample taken. Participants will have an X-ray of participants knee taken at the first visit. If participants have had an X-ray recently, this may not be needed.\n\nAt 6 of the clinic visits participants cannot take pain medications for 3 days before the visit. Participants cannot take part if participants have had a joint replacement surgery in participants knee. Participants cannot take part if participants have or have had diabetes.
