Participants in the study will receive either bupropion or placebo (\"sugar\" pill, inactive medication) as an outpatient for eight weeks. In addition, participants will be given the option to receive 8 weeks of free behavioral weight loss treatment. This treatment, known to be effective for reducing binge eating and helping people lose weight, will be administered following the medication phase and at no cost.\n\nIt is expected that compared to placebo, bupropion will produce greater reductions in binge eating.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Frequency of Binge Eating Episodes","timeFrame":"One week (at post treatment)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bupropion","deltaMin":0.8,"sd":1.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":1.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23656848"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":31},"commonTop":[]}}
