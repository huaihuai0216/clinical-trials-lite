The study is comprised of two parts, as follows: A dose-finding part (Part 1, Phase Ib) will aim to identify the dose of atezolizumab SC to be tested in Part 2. A dose-confirmation part (Part 2, Phase III, randomized) will aim to confirm that the dose moved forward from Part 1 yields drug exposure that is comparable to that of atezolizumab IV.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part 1: Serum Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Atezolizumab at Cycle 1","timeFrame":"Pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 2 (Cycle length =21 days for cohorts 1 and 3 and 14 days for cohort 2)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 1 Cohort 1: Atezolizumab SC Co-mix 1800 mg","deltaMin":121,"sd":42.8},{"arm":"Part 1 Cohort 2: Atezolizumab SC Co-mix 1200 mg","deltaMin":77.5,"sd":51.4},{"arm":"Part 1 Cohort 3: Atezolizumab SC Co-mix 1800 mg","deltaMin":78.3,"sd":88.6}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":71,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","Chile","China","Costa Rica","France","Greece","Guatemala","Hungary","Italy","Latvia","Mexico","New Zealand","Peru","Poland","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37268157","33788415"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":13},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Fatigue","Decreased Appetite","Cough","Dyspnoea"]}}
