The number of patients failing on their first-line regimen is increasing thereby requiring a switch to second-line treatment to reduce accumulation of drug-resistance mutations, disease progression, HIV transmission, and death. WHO guidelines recommend second-line antiretroviral therapy for adults consisting of two NRTIs + a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI); atazanavir (ATV) plus ritonavir (RTV) or lopinavir (LPV)/RTV are the preferred boosted PI options. This study is conducted to demonstrate non-inferior antiviral activity at 48 weeks of a dolutegravir (DTG) containing regimen compared to a WHO-recommended standard of care regimen for second line treatment, LPV/RTV + two NRTIs, in HIV-1 infected patients failing first line therapy. This study comprises of a Screening Phase (approximately 28 to 42 days), a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to Week 48 plus a 4-week treatment extension), and a Continuation Phase. Approximately 612 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive DTG 50 milligram (mg) once daily or LPV/RTV (800/200 mg once daily or 400/100 mg twice daily, in accordance with investigator decision and local label), each added to an investigator selected background regimen of two NRTIs at least one of which needs to be fully active based on viral resistance testing at Screening. Subjects randomized to the LPV/RTV arm will either (i) continue receiving LPV/RTV and complete the study after the 4-week treatment extension at Week 52, or (ii) switch to the DTG arm prior to study completion at Week 52 and continue to have access to DTG in the Continuation Phase. Subjects randomized to receive DTG who successfully complete 52 weeks of treatment and subjects originally randomized to receive LPV/RTV but switched to DTG prior to Week 52 will continue to have access to DTG until it is either locally approved and commercial supplies are available to patients or the patient no longer derives clinical benefit, or the patient meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Participants Receiving DTG-Randomized Phase","deltaMin":84,"sd":null},{"arm":"Participants Receiving LPV/RTV-Randomized Phase","deltaMin":70,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":59,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","Chile","China","Colombia","Kenya","Mexico","Peru","Romania","Russia","South Africa","Thailand","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30732940","34694877"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":314},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Nausea","Lower respiratory tract infection"]}}
