It is most commonly caused by dermatophytes. Itraconazole has been approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United States with an approved dosage regimen for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail of once daily (QD) treatment with 200mg of itraconazole (two 100 mg capsules) for 12 weeks. Barrier Therapeutics has developed a 200 mg tablet which could be used in a more convenient one-tablet-per-day dosing regimen. This clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of this new tablet formulation with itraconazole capsules and placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical and Mycological Cure of Target Toenail","timeFrame":"1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Itraconazole Tablets","deltaMin":22.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Tablets","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":68,"countries":["United States","Canada","Dominican Republic","Ecuador","Honduras","Panama","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23884486"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":582},"commonTop":["Hypoacusis"]}}
