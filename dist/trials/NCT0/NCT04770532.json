Participants will either get insulin icodec that participants will have to inject once a week on the same day of the week or insulin degludec that participants will have to inject once a day at the same time every day. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance.\n\nThe insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm or stomach.\n\nThe study will last for about 8 months. Participants will have 17 clinic visits and 13 phone calls with the study doctor. At 8 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 4 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit.\n\nParticipants will be asked to wear a sensor that measures their blood sugar all the time in 3 periods for a total of 13 weeks (about 3 months) during the study.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 0), Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Icodec","deltaMin":-0.93,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Insulin Degludec","deltaMin":-0.71,"sd":0.06}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":71,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Germany","Japan","Poland","Portugal","South Africa","South Korea","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36106652","37148899","40465144","40186685","39368488","39344833"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":262},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diabetic retinopathy","Diarrhoea","Headache"]}}
