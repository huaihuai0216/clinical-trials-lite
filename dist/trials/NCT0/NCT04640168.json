Subjects will be assessed daily while hospitalized. If the subjects are discharged from the hospital, they will have a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subjects, it is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests, oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, plasma (Day 29), and serum for secondary research as well as clinical outcome data. However, if infection control or other restrictions limit the ability of the subject to return to the clinic, these visits may be conducted by phone, and only clinical data will be obtained. The Day 22 visit does not have laboratory tests or collection of samples and is conducted by phone. The primary objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of baricitinib + remdesivir versus dexamethasone + remdesivir as assessed by the mechanical ventilation free survival by Day 29.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Proportion of Participants Not Meeting Criteria for One of the Following Two Ordinal Scale Categories at Any Time: 8) Death; 7) Hospitalized, on Invasive Mechanical Ventilation or Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)","timeFrame":"Day 1 through Day 29","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Remdesivir Plus Baricitinib","deltaMin":0.87,"sd":null},{"arm":"Remdesivir Plus Dexamethasone","deltaMin":0.88,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.909"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","Japan","Mexico","Singapore","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36442063","35617986","34473343"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":95,"n":503},"commonTop":["Lymphocyte count decreased"]}}
