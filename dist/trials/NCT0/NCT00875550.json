The key study objectives are:\n\n* To characterize the loading and maintenance dosing of DEX by age group and overall medical condition of pediatric subjects\n* To evaluate the safety and efficacy of loading and maintenance infusions for sedation in initially intubated and mechanically ventilated PICU subjects\n* To explore the exposure-response relationship between dose of DEX and clinical measures of sedation and safety","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects That do Not Require Rescue Midazolam (MDZ) for Sedation Based on Achieving and Maintaining a Target University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) Score of 1 to 3 While Intubated.","timeFrame":"6 to 24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dexmedetomidine Low Dose","deltaMin":44.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dexmedetomidine High Dose","deltaMin":54.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Month","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":89},"commonTop":["Hypokalaemia","Pyrexia","Hypotension","Agitation","Atelectasis"]}}
