The study will last for about 1Â½ years. This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide once a week or people taking liraglutide once every day. Participants will either get semaglutide, liraglutide or \"dummy\" medicine. Which treatment is decided by chance. Participants who receive semaglutide or semaglutide \"dummy\" medicine will need to take 1 injection once a week. Participants who receive liraglutide or liraglutide \"dummy\" medicine will need to take 1 injection once daily. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. During the study participants will have talks with study staff about eating healthy food and how to be more physically active. Participants will have 16 clinic visits and 7 phone calls with the study doctor. At 4 of the clinic visits participants cannot eat and drink (water is allowed) for 8 hours before the visit. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 68 in Body Weight (%) (Semaglutide 2.4 mg Versus Liraglutide 3.0 mg)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 68","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-16.4,"sd":10.5},{"arm":"Liraglutide 3.0 mg","deltaMin":-6.4,"sd":7.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34775881","35015037","35791625"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":126},"commonTop":["Nausea","Constipation","Diarrhoea","Vomiting","Headache"]}}
