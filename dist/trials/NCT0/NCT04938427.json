A placebo looks just like soticlestat but will not have any medicine in it. Participants will take soticlestat or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by a gradual dose reduction for 1 week. Then, participants will be followed up for 2 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Major Motor Drop (MMD) Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days During the Full Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Baseline; Full Treatment Period: Weeks 1 to 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-6.69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Soticlestat","deltaMin":-6.11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.785"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":98,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","China","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/60e30ebd1f1122001e30a940"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":136},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Change in seizure presentation","Nasopharyngitis","Pyrexia","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
