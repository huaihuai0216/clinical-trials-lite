Participants currently receiving subcutaneous darbopoetin alfa maintenance treatment will receive subcutaneous methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta for a maximum of 32 weeks at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms every 4 weeks according to the dose of darbopoetin alfa administered in Week -1. Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter (g/dL).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Their Mean Hb Concentration Within Plus/Minus (Â±) 1 Grams Per Deciliter (g/dL) of the Reference Range and Between 10.0 and 12.0 g/dL During Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)","timeFrame":"EEP: Weeks 17 to 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol-Epoetin Beta","deltaMin":65.85,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":111},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Renal impairment"]}}
