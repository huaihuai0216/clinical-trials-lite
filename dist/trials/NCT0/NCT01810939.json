The study also evaluated the effect of withdrawing patiromer treatment and assessed whether chronic treatment with patiromer prevented the recurrence of hyperkalemia. The safety of patiromer treatment was also evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Serum Potassium From Part A Baseline to Part A Week 4","timeFrame":"Part A Baseline to Part A Week 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part A Patiromer","deltaMin":-1.01,"sd":0.031}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":58,"countries":["United States","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Georgia","Hungary","Italy","Serbia","Slovenia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25415805","32588430"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":243},"commonTop":["Constipation","Headache","Hypertension","Influenza"]}}
