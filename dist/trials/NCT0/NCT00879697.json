Both groups trained twice a week, for 12 weeks, at the same rate of perceived exertion. ST consisted of 3 sets of 10 repetitions of whole body exercises. WT consisted of 15 two-minute bouts of walking intercalated with 2 minutes of resting.\n\nMeasurements: Walking capacity, peak VO2, walking economy, ankle brachial index, ischemic window and knee extension strength","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Walking Distance","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Strength Training","deltaMin":618,"sd":282},{"arm":"Walking Training","deltaMin":572,"sd":231}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Brazil"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18784409","21948782","19837534"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Inguinal hernia","Gastrointestinal problems","Diagnose Lung cancer","Diagnose aneurysm"]}}
