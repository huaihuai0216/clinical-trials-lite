Overactive Bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined as symptoms of urgency and frequency with urge urinary incontinence (OAB-wet) and without urge incontinence (OAB-dry). Conservative first line treatments for urge incontinence combined with other OAB symptoms (OAB-wet) include behavioral therapy, pelvic floor training +/- biofeedback, or the use of anticholinergic medications. These treatment modalities may not result in total continence and often drug therapy is discontinued because of lack of efficacy, side effects and cost or because of not wanting to take a pill. Behavioral therapy and pelvic muscle exercises require consistent, active intervention by the patient which is often not sustained. Thus, the objective of the Anticholinergic vs Botox Comparison Study (ABC) is to determine whether a single intra-detrusor injection of botulinum toxin A (Botox A®) is more effective than a standardized regimen of oral anticholinergics in reducing urge urinary incontinence. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the change from baseline in average number of urge urinary incontinence episodes over 6 months between groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Episodes","timeFrame":"Baseline through 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Botox A","deltaMin":-3.13,"sd":0.2851},{"arm":"Standardized Anticholinergic Regimen","deltaMin":-3.15,"sd":0.2761}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38651909","33620895","27564385","26516810","23036134","22008247"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":121},"commonTop":["Any Gastrointestinal Disorders","Dry mouth","Any General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions","Any Renal and Urinary Disorders","Injection site pain"]}}
