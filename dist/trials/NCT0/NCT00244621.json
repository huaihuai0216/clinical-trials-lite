It employs a double blind, randomized, dose ranging design intended for conduct as a multicenter trial. There are 3 study 'periods': a 1-week placebo run-in, a 4-week double blind treatment, and a 52-week open-label, long-term treatment period. Subjects undergo a screening evaluation, then a 1-week single-blind, placebo run-in, after which eligible subjects are allocated to receive 1 of 3 dose levels of candesartan cilexetil (0.05 mg/kg, or 0.20 mg /kg or 0.40 mg /kg), liquid formulation, in a 1:1:1 ratio for 4-weeks. At the end of randomized dose allocation (Day 28), blood pressure assessment will be performed and subjects may begin the 52-week, open-label treatment period of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)","timeFrame":"From randomisation to end of double-blind treatment (4 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Atacand .05 mg","deltaMin":-6,"sd":9.4},{"arm":"Atacand .20 mg","deltaMin":-8.9,"sd":9.2},{"arm":"Atacand .40 mg","deltaMin":-12,"sd":8.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Poland","Puerto Rico","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20160654"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6},"commonTop":[]}}
