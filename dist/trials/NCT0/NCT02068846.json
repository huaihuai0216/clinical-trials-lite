Participants are adults HIV+SGD+ who will be randomized 1:1 to receive BK Virus antiviral (ciprofloxacin) or placebo for 28 days. Salivary function/protein secretion will be correlated with BK polyomavirus titers. It is expected that patients with HIV+SGD+ will have elevated oral BK polyomavirus viral loads and will benefit from Ciprofloxacin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"BK Viral Status in Saliva at Week 4","timeFrame":"Week 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ciprofloxacin","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":9},"commonTop":["Rash"]}}
