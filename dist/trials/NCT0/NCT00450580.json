This study utilizes a group-sequential design with two stages: 1) an interim 24 week cohort analysis of approximately 200 subjects and 2) if study continuation criteria are met at this interim analysis, further enrolment of an additional 528 subjects, followed over a minimum of 48 weeks. The objectives of the study are to demonstrate 1) non-inferior antiviral activity of fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400mg/100mg QD compared to fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700mg/100mg BID and 2) a superior fasting non-HDL lipid profile in subjects receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400mg/100mg QD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA <400 and >=400 Copies/mL Over 48 Weeks","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FPV/RTV 1400/100 mg Once Daily (QD) + ABC/3TC FDC 600/300 mg Q","deltaMin":81,"sd":null},{"arm":"FPV/RTV 700/100 mg BID + ABC/3TC FDC 600/300 mg QD","deltaMin":82,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":69,"countries":["Belgium","France","Germany","Italy","Romania","Russia","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20133266","18383194"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Rash","Drug hypersensitivity"]}}
