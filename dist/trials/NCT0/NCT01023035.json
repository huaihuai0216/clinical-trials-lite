All participants in this trial will be treated with the triple combination of boceprevir plus PEG2b/RBV. If a participant becomes anemic during treatment, the participant will be randomized to one of two therapeutic strategies for management of anemia (erythropoietin use versus RBV dose reduction).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)","timeFrame":"At Follow-up Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ribavirin Dose Reduction Arm","deltaMin":71.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Erythropoietin Use Arm","deltaMin":70.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["23924660"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":39,"n":249},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Anaemia","Headache","Alopecia"]}}
