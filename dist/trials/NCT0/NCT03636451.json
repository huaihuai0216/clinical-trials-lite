Participants are eligible to enroll if they are a planning to have a D\\&C in a participating clinic. The investigators are studying how different ratios of medication to liquid affect pain when injected around the cervix. Both potential methods use the same dose of medication, though researchers would like to know which one works better. To be in this study, participants must be over the age of 18 with an early pregnancy loss or undesired pregnancy measuring less than 12 weeks gestation undergoing D\\&C while awake in clinic.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain With Cervical Dilation","timeFrame":"Once during the procedure on the day of recruitment, approximately one minute.
