Pylori eradication. It is hypothesized that quadruple therapy will be comparable in efficacy to triple therapy. Subjects with confirmed H. pylori positive status will be randomized to one of the treatments described above. At week 6 and 10 follow-up visits, a urea breath test (UBT) will be performed to confirm eradication.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Confirmed by Urea Breath Test","timeFrame":"Week 6 and week 10 follow-up visits","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Quadruple Therapy (OBMT) 10 Days","deltaMin":166,"sd":null},{"arm":"Triple Therapy (OAC) 7 Days","deltaMin":112,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21345487"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":216},"commonTop":["Dyspepsia","Diarrhea","Abdominal pain upper","Dysgeusia","Headache"]}}
