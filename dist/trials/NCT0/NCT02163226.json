Researchers also want to learn if 1 large dose of radiation therapy can help decrease the use of drugs to control the pain, and if it can help to control the disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Intent- to- Treat Patients With Pain Response by Treatment","timeFrame":"From date of registration until the date of first documented Pain failure or death from any cause, or lost to follow up, whichever came first, assessed up to 9 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: the Standard Hypofractionated Regimen (MFRT Group)","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Single-fraction Stereotactic Radiation (SBRT Group)","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":".03"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".19"},{"comp":"OG000","p":".04"},{"comp":"OG000","p":".89"},{"comp":"OG000","p":".07"},{"comp":"OG001","p":".03"},{"comp":"OG001","p":".19"},{"comp":"OG001","p":".04"},{"comp":"OG001","p":".89"},{"comp":"OG001","p":".07"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31021390"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":79},"commonTop":[]}}
