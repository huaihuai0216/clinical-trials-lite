Specifically, non-inferiority of Combivent Respimat® to COMBIVENT® MDI in FEV1 AUC from 0 to 6 hours , superiority of Combivent Respimat® to Atrovent Respimat® monotherapy in FEV1 AUC from 0 to 4 hours, and non-inferiority of Combivent Respimat® to Atrovent Respimat® monotherapy in FEV1 AUC from 4 to 6 hours will be analyzed. In addition, steady state pharmacokinetics over one dosing interval following 4 weeks of therapy will be characterized in a subgroup of patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"FEV1 AUC0-6 at Day 85","timeFrame":"Before drug administration to 6 hours after drug administration on Day 85","effectByArm":[{"arm":"COMBIVENT Respimat 20/100 mcg","deltaMin":0.145,"sd":0.007},{"arm":"COMBIVENT CFC-MDI 36/206 mcg","deltaMin":0.149,"sd":0.007},{"arm":"Ipratropium Respimat 20 mcg","deltaMin":0.119,"sd":0.007}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.7135"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":180,"countries":["United States","Argentina","France","Greece","New Zealand","Poland","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20172704"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17},"commonTop":["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"]}}
