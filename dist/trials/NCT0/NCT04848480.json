Which treatment participants get is decided at random. Participants will also get a mealtime insulin.\n\nThe insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm or stomach.\n\nThe study will last for about 1 year and 2 months. Participants will have 28 clinic visits and 28 phone calls with the study doctor. At 11 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken.\n\nAt 6 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit.\n\nParticipants will be asked to wear a sensor that measures your blood sugar all the time. Participants will be asked to wear it for a total of 57 weeks (around 1 year).\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Icodec + Insulin Aspart","deltaMin":-0.47,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Insulin Degludec + Insulin Aspart","deltaMin":-0.51,"sd":0.06}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0065"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":99,"countries":["United States","Austria","Canada","Germany","India","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Russia","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36106652","40465144","37863084"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":290},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nasopharyngitis","Diabetic retinopathy","Pyrexia","Headache"]}}
