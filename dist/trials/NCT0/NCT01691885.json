This will be assessed by measures of right and left global and regional systolic and diastolic cardiac function as assessed using a 30 minute CMR.\n\nA secondary objective will be to investigate the effect of FF/VI inhalation powder 100/25mcg QD on measures of arterial stiffness in the form of pulse wave analysis and distensability in the pulmonary and systemic circulation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Right Ventricular End Diastolic Volume Index (RVEDVI) at the End of the Overall Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Baseline and end of Treatment Period (7 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.47,"sd":1.393},{"arm":"FF/VI","deltaMin":5.35,"sd":1.365}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31833441","26550687"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":43},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
