The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab extends overall survival compared to TPC.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival in Participants With Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) With Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥10","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 36 months (through Final Analysis database cutoff date of 11-April-2019)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":12.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy","deltaMin":11.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0574"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["40526219","37976633","33676601"],"seeAlso":["http://merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":309},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fatigue","Constipation","Diarrhoea","Cough"]}}
