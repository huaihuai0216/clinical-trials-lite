Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive tocilizumab 8mg/kg iv or placebo iv every 4 weeks, in conjunction with stable DMARD therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 Response at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo + DMARDs","deltaMin":24.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab + DMARDs","deltaMin":69.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":68},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Leukopenia","Nasopharyngitis","Rash"]}}
