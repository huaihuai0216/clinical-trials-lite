Patients will receive monthly intravenous injections of Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms/month, depending on the dose of epoetin alfa or beta they were receiving in the week preceding study start. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Average Hemoglobin Concentration Within +\\- 1 Gram/Deciliter of Their Reference Hb and Between 10.5 and 12.5 Gram/Deciliter During EEP","timeFrame":"EEP (Week 16 to Week 24)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RO0503821 (1x/4 Weeks)","deltaMin":54.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":18,"countries":["Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":45,"n":200},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Gastritis","Gastritis erosive","Haemorrhoids","Osteoarthritis"]}}
