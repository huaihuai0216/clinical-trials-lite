The main aim of the study is to check if the cytomegalovirus infection can no longer be detected after treatment with marivabir or valganciclovir.\n\nParticipants will take 2 tablets of marivabir or valganciclovir and 2 tablets of placebo twice a day for 8 weeks. A placebo will look like marivabir or valganciclovir but will not have any medicine in it.\n\nAfter treatment, each participant will be followed up for up to 12 weeks.\n\nParticipants will visit their study clinic up to 18 times during the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Confirmed Clearance of Plasma Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA) at the End of Study Week 8","timeFrame":"Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Valganciclovir 900 mg BID","deltaMin":212,"sd":null},{"arm":"Maribavir 400 mg BID","deltaMin":190,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":129,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","Croatia","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Israel","Italy","New Zealand","Poland","Russia","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39302855","38036487","37899366"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b5fd74db2bf003ab46ecf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":95,"n":274},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Nausea","Anaemia","Vomiting","Diarrhoea"]}}
