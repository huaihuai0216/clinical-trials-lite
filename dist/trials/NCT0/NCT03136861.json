This study also explored the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg compared to secukinumab 150 mg from Week 8 to Week 24 in order to assess the potential additional benefits of dose escalation in patients with axSpA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Spinal Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Score Below 4 at Week 8 (Treatment Period 1)","timeFrame":"Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Secukinumab 150 mg (Group A)","deltaMin":91,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (Group B)","deltaMin":19,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0264"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0720"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0043"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":66,"countries":["Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","Finland","Greece","Ireland","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Poland","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34707696"],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/patientsummary/patientsummaries?patientSummaryId=550"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":285},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Oropharyngeal pain","Upper respiratory tract infection","Blood creatinine increased"]}}
