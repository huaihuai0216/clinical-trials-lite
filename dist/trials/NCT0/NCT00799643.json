In this study we will determine whether salsalate, a member of the commonly used Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) class, is effective in lowering sugars in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will determine whether salicylates represent a new pharmacological option for diabetes management. The study is conducted in two stages. Enrollment in the first stage is complete. The primary objective of the first stage was to select a dose of salsalate that is both well-tolerated and demonstrates a trend toward improvement in glycemic control. The primary objective of Stage 2 of the study is to evaluate the effects of salsalate on blood sugar control in diabetes; the tolerability of salsalate use in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); and the effects of salsalate on measures of inflammation, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiac risk.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Primary Outcome for the TINSAL-T2D Study is Change in HbA1c Level From Baseline to Week 48 From Baseline, Compared Between Treatment Groups.","timeFrame":"48 weeks from baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.04,"sd":null},{"arm":"Salsalate","deltaMin":-0.33,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16823477","17959861","19337387","20231565","23817699","24130358"],"seeAlso":["http://tinsalt2d.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":140},"commonTop":["Cough","Tinnitus","Muscle Stiffness","Weakness or Fatigue","Vomiting"]}}
