It is normally started 1-week before stopping smoking and used for up to 12-24 weeks. We are trying to find out if using varenicline for an extended time (4-weeks) before stopping smoking is better than the standard 1-week of use prior to stopping.\n\nThe study will recruit 100 smokers who want to stop. They will be randomly allocated to receive varenicline(4-weeks) or placebo (3-weeks followed by 1-week of active treatment as indicated by standard prescribing practice), followed by a 12-week open label treatment period where all participants will receive varenicline.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rating of Urges to Smoke 24 Hours and One Week After the Target Quit Date Assessed by Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale","timeFrame":"24 hours and 7 days after quit date (week 4)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Varenicline","deltaMin":2.47,"sd":1.13},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.88,"sd":1.15}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.14"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37142273","21518946"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":53},"commonTop":["Nausea","Abnormal dreams","Headache","Sleep disturbance","Dyspepsia"]}}
