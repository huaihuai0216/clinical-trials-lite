For this purpose patients being treated for at least 12 months with Flolan® will be switched from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A and followed-up for 90 days. During these 90 days safety and tolerability of EFI/ACT-385781A will closely be monitored in all treated patients. This 90 follow-up will provide clinical evidence on the safety, tolerability, efficacy and treatment satisfaction of switching from Flolan® to EFI/ACT-385781A in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance From Baseline to End of Treatment (EOT).","timeFrame":"Approximately 3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"EFI/ACT-385781A","deltaMin":595.7,"sd":237.14}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Belgium","Canada","France","Italy","Netherlands","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":41},"commonTop":["HEADACHE","NASOPHARYNGITIS","PAIN IN JAW","FLUSHING","DYSPNOEA"]}}
