The first six weeks of the study will be double-blind and the remainder of the study will be open label. Participants in this study consist of participants who have completed the preceding short-term study (P06124 \\[NCT01098110\\]), who meet the inclusion criteria and wish to continue receiving study drug, and whom the investigators have deemed eligible for study participation. Participants who were on placebo twice daily (BID) in core trial P06124 will get placebo for the first 2 weeks then 5 mg asenapine BID for the next 4 weeks of double blind treatment, and will be re-randomized after week 6 to asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg BID. Participants who were on asenapine 5 mg BID in core trial P06124 will be re-randomized after Week 6 to asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg BID. Participants who were on asenapine 10 mg BID in core trial P06124 will be re-randomized after Week 6 to asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg BID. After re-randomization, drug will be administered open-label for 46 weeks. During this period dose is flexible can be adjusted using dose options of 5 and 10 mg BID for efficacy and tolerability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants in Categories of Change in Weight From Study P06124 Baseline to Final Assessment","timeFrame":"Study P06124 baseline and P06125 study from Day 1 up to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo/Asenapine","deltaMin":12.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Asenapine 5/10 mg BID","deltaMin":26.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["37232002"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":44},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Weight increased","Schizophrenia","Somnolence","Headache"]}}
