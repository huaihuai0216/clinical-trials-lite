The investigators hypothesize that one of the main reasons for that is the heterogeneity of previously studied populations. Since currently the risk of postoperative PAL can be scored with a reasonable accuracy, the aim of this research is to investigate the effect of routine application of a novel tissue sealant in patients selected on the basis of a high risk of PAL estimated before surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Prolonged Air Leak (PAL)","timeFrame":"From day of surgery to the fifth postoperative day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Group","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":24,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.171"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":118},"commonTop":[]}}
