Patient safety will be monitored continuously throughout the trial. In addition, the effects of JC0498 treatment in this patient population will be assessed by periodically evaluating aspects of MPS I disease in patients at scheduled intervals over the duration of the trial.\n\nSince patients may be eligible for the trial if they have received JC0498, a portion of the data may be captured retrospectively and recorded onto the case report forms (CRFs).\n\nThis study represents the first good clinical practice (GCP) effort to characterize MPS I in the Japanese population and evaluate the effects of JC0498 on disease manifestations.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Safety Evaluation","timeFrame":"Up to 73 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aldurazyme (Laronidase) Treatment","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":3},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Otitis media","Oxygen saturation decreased","Heat rash","Conjunctivitis"]}}
