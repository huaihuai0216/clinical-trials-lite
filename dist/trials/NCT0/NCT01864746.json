Considering the high risk of recurrence in patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a high CPS-EG score, palbociclib appears to be an attractive option with a favourable safety profile for these patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Invasive Disease Free Survival (iDFS) for Palbociclib vs. Placebo in Patients With High CPS-EG Score After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Receiving Standard Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy for HR-positive/HER2-normal Primary Breast Cancer.","timeFrame":"From date of randomisation to data cut off: 24 August 2020 (approximately 6 years and 6 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Palbociclib","deltaMin":81.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":77.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Canada","France","Germany","Ireland","Japan","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21482989","21734724","22955616","19874578","17785706","15687361","22508812","33793299","40209141"],"seeAlso":["http://www.gbg.de/en/trials/penelope.php"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":64,"n":633},"commonTop":["Leukopenia","Neutropenia","Fatigue","Infection","Anemia"]}}
