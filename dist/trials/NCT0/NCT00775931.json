Prior multi-institutional data in past studies found that approximately 30% of Osteopetrosis patients do not engraft. Therefore, in this study, we utilize a reduced intensity design of pre-transplant drugs to try to make transplants safer for this disease, as well as to provide a second infusion of stem cells in patients with matched related or unrelated donors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients Who Achieved Donor Cell Engraftment","timeFrame":"Day 100","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Marrow Graft Transplant Conditioning","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cord Blood Transplant Conditioning","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Day","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":6},"commonTop":["Requires Intubation, NOS","Pericardial Effusion","Pneumonia","Bacterial Infection, Blood","Fungal Infection, Respiratory"]}}
