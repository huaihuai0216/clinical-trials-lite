This vaginal gel is called Phexxi™ (previously known as Amphora) and was compared to a commercially available spermicide called Conceptrol®, which contains nonoxynol 9; commonly abbreviated as N-9. Conceptrol® can help prevent pregnancy. This study objective was to determine if this product prevents pregnancy when inserted into the vagina before intercourse.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"6-Month (183 Days) Cumulative Pregnancy Percentage","timeFrame":"183 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Conceptrol","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"Amphora","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":43},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["United States","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":1477},"commonTop":["Urinary Tract Infection","Vaginitis Bacterial","Vulvovaginal Mycotic","Headache","Vulvovaginal Pruritus"]}}
