In half the adults, all 3 doses given are the Clostridium difficile vaccine, and in half the adults, 2 of the 3 doses are the Clostridium difficile vaccine with the other dose containing no active ingredients. The study will look at the subjects' immune response to the vaccine and assess the safety and tolerability of a 2-dose regimen of Clostridium difficile vaccine compared to a 3-dose regimen of Clostridium difficile vaccine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Adjusted Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) of Clostridium Difficile Toxin A and Toxin B Specific Neutralizing Antibodies at Month 7 for Evaluable Immunogenicity Population (EIP)","timeFrame":"Month 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2-Dose Clostridium Difficile Vaccine","deltaMin":693,"sd":null},{"arm":"3-Dose Clostridium Difficile Vaccine","deltaMin":845.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=B5091019"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":141,"n":994},"commonTop":["Fatigue (FATIGUE)","Injection site pain (PAIN)","Headache (HEADACHE)","Myalgia (MUSCLE PAIN)","Arthralgia (JOINT PAIN)"]}}
