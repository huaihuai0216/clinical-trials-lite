Current treatment for facial nerve paralysis is a 10 day course of oral steroids (which will reduce the inflammation), with electrodiagnostic testing. There have been limited studies on the use of intratympanic steroid injection, in addition to oral steroid, in the recovery of facial nerve paralysis. There are indications that the use of intratympanic injections, in addition to the oral steroids, will speed up the recovery rate of the facial nerve paralysis, as well as improve the complete recovery of the facial nerve paralysis. This study will randomize patients with facial nerve paralysis into two groups: 1) oral steroid only and 2) oral steroid plus a 3 intratympanic steroid injections spaced out over three weeks. There are a subset of patients that are unable to take oral steroids for medical reasons (such as diabetes); these patients will be placed into a third group and only receive 3 intratympanic steroid injections space out over three weeks. Subjects that are to receive the intratympanic injection will receive pre- and post-hearing exams as part of their standard of care. Patients will be evaluated via videorecording by two blinded investigators as well as in person evaluations by the unblinded treating physician.\n\nSubjects will be followed until complete facial nerve paralysis recovery or one year post-treatment, whichever comes first.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Facial Nerve Recovery","timeFrame":"Up to 365 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":7,"sd":0},{"arm":"SOC + Injection","deltaMin":81.56,"sd":47.671}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1},"commonTop":[]}}
