In brief, 36 OEF/OIF veterans with chronic PTSD or PTSS of at least 3 months duration will be randomly assigned to 15 sessions of either PE or TAU (see below for descriptions of the interventions). All veterans will receive psychobiological assessments at pre treatment, mid treatment, post treatment, 3 months, and 6 months follow-up. Each of these assessments will cover in 2 sessions on separate days and will include interview and self-report of symptoms (i.e., PTSD, depression, and general anxiety severity), self-report of PTSD-related cognitions, psychophysiological (i.e., heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, and end-tidal CO2) assessment during neutral and trauma scripts, and assessment of salivary cortisol during neutral and trauma scripts. Also, on the morning prior to each laboratory assessment, patients will collect salivary cortisol at the moment of waking and 30 and 45 minutes post-walking. In addition to these assessments, patients assigned to PE will collect salivary cortisol during three imaginal exposure sessions (sessions 3, 9, and 15).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (Pre & Posttreatment)","timeFrame":"PostTreatment (Week 12)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Prolonged Exposure","deltaMin":30,"sd":18.4},{"arm":"Present Centered Therapy","deltaMin":53.6,"sd":28.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23696427","35950709","28102979"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":[]}}
