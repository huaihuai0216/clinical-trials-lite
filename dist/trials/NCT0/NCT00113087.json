The study will also compare the effect of ACE-I therapy to placebo on somatic growth and compare the effect of ACE-I therapy to placebo on signs and symptoms of heart failure, neurodevelopmental and functional status, ventricular geometry, function, and atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation. In addition, the study will determine the relationship between genetic polymorphisms linked to ventricular hypertrophy (enlarged heart) and the response to ACE-I therapy and compare the incidence of adverse events in subjects treated with ACE-I with those in subjects treated with placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Weight-for-age Z-score at 14 Months of Age","timeFrame":"Measured at baseline, 2 weeks after starting study drug, just prior to the Glenn surgery, 7 days after restarting drug following the Glenn surgery, at 10 months of age, and at 14 months of age","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Enalapril","deltaMin":-0.62,"sd":0.13},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.42,"sd":0.13}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.28"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26490132","22939929","22939855","22931751","21784436","21576655","20625111","19081394"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":88,"n":115},"commonTop":["infection","Pulmonary/upper respiratory","gastrointestinal","Cardiac General","metabolic/laboratory"]}}
