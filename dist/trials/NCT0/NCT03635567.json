Possible chemotherapy regimens include: paclitaxel plus cisplatin with or without bevacizumab and paclitaxel plus carboplatin with or without bevacizumab.\n\nThe primary study hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to placebo plus chemotherapy with respect to: 1) Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by the Investigator, or, 2) Overall Survival (OS).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator in Participants With Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 46 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab+Chemotherapy","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo+Chemotherapy","deltaMin":8.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":149,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","Chile","Colombia","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Peru","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37910822","40590325","39499492","38095881","36878237","34534429"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":157,"n":307},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Anaemia","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Constipation"]}}
