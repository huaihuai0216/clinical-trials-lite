Optison is a contrast agent that improves the images of the heart on the echocardiogram (echo) machine. Optison is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use during stress echocardiograms. Regadenoson is a commercially available rapid acting stress agent that is used to chemically increase the heart rate and is approved for nuclear imaging tests. Regadenoson is a FDA approved drug but not for the intended use in this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Coronary Stenosis","timeFrame":"1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regadenoson; Optison","deltaMin":50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.echo.2015.08.011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["Shortness of Breath","Headaches","Chest Pain"]}}
