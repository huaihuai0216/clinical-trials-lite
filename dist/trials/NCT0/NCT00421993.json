Efficacy and safety evaluations will be performed at Screening (safety only), Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All Investigator's Global Assessment evaluators and lesion counters must be trained and approved by Galderma. The evaluator of a subject should remain the same during the study.\n\nThe primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority in efficacy and assess safety of Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel (Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel) versus Adapalene Topical Gel, 0.1% (Adapalene Monad); Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel, 2.5% (Benzoyl Peroxide Monad) and Topical Gel Vehicle (Gel Vehicle) in the treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Success Rate on the Investigator's Global Assessment","timeFrame":"at week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Gel","deltaMin":37.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adapalene Gel","deltaMin":21.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Benzoyl Peroxide Gel","deltaMin":26.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gel Vehicle","deltaMin":17.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":62,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Hungary","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12963896"],"seeAlso":["http://www.galderma.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":419},"commonTop":["Dry Skin"]}}
