The immediate objectives are to (1) implement three component model (3CM) in VA primary care clinics; and (2) evaluate the effects of 3CM on clinician behavior and patient outcomes. The long-term objectives are to generate information to support implementation research on the RESPECT model for treating PTSD in primary care and ultimately, the implementation of the model in VHA to provide care to veterans with PTSD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"PTSD Symptom Severity","timeFrame":"3 and 6 months after initial assessment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm1/Three Component Model of Care Collaborative Care","deltaMin":31.4,"sd":10.2},{"arm":"Arm 2/Usual Care","deltaMin":31.5,"sd":10.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22865017"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":96},"commonTop":[]}}
