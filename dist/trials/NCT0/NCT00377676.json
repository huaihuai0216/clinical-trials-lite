While the primary purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile of Cycloset in type 2 diabetes, any potential positive cardiovascular benefits will be evaluated as well.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Subjects Experiencing Serious Adverse Events","timeFrame":"From baseline to week 52.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cycloset","deltaMin":176,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["17592632","20332352","28374645","27687032","26060823","23316290"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":176,"n":2054},"commonTop":["nausea","Dizziness","Fatigue","headache","vomiting"]}}
