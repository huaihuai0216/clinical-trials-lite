The primary hypotheses are: Olaparib + Bevacizumab is superior to a fluoropyrimidine + Bevacizumab with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR); Olaparib is superior to a fluoropyrimidine + Bevacizumab with respect to PFS using RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. As of amendment 5 study enrollment is being discontinued and study participants randomized to one of the two experimental arms (olaparib plus bevacizumab or olaparib monotherapy) must discontinue study intervention. Participants who are still on study treatment will no longer have tumor response assessments by BICR.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST) 1.1 as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 30 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Olaparib + Bevacizumab","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Olaparib","deltaMin":3.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bevacizumab + Chemotherapy","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.9774"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.9993"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":129,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Chile","Colombia","France","Germany","Hungary","Japan","Latvia","Lithuania","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38749110","34779646"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26089&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":111},"commonTop":["Nausea","Anaemia","Decreased appetite","Constipation","Abdominal pain"]}}
