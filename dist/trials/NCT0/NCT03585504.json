Additionally, this study aims to compare the acceptability of bleeding in postpartum adolescents who have an etonogestrel contraceptive implant prior to discharge versus those with insertion at the six week postpartum visit. The investigators will evaluate the acceptability of bleeding rather than collect prospective diaries because the investigators feel subjective perceptions of bleeding impact contraceptive continuation more than quantitative differences in bleeding.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Contraceptive Implant Continuation at Six Months Postpartum","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention Group","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36302159"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
