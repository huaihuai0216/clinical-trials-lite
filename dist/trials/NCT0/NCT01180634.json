Aerosol delivery of antibiotics directly to the lung increases the local concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection resulting in improved antimicrobial effects compared to systemic administration. Decreased efficacy, intolerance and high treatment burden with currently available therapies indicate a need for additional therapies. MP-376 (Aeroquin™) is a novel formulation of the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin that has been optimized for aerosol delivery. Preclinical and clinical studies conducted to date show that aerosol doses of MP-376 are safe and well tolerated, exert an antimicrobial effect, improve lung function and reduce the need for other anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. High concentrations of levofloxacin in the lung delivered as MP-376 are active against CF pathogens including those with high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels to aminoglycosides such as tobramycin (TOBI®) and other inhaled antimicrobial agents. Inhaled MP-376 can be delivered rapidly and efficiently using a customized PARI investigational configuration of the eFlow® nebulizer system.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to an Exacerbation","timeFrame":"Baseline to end of study (up to 59 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aeroquin 240 mg","deltaMin":58,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":51.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0715"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Israel","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":219},"commonTop":["Cough","Nausea","Sputum increased","Respiratory tract congestion","Dysgeusia"]}}
