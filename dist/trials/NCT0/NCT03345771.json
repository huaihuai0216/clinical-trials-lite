Approximately 240 subjects (120 for total knee arthroplasty and 120 for total hip arthroplasty) will be enrolled to evaluate the outcomes associated with silver impregnated dressings and negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in treating this subset of patients and analyze the cost benefit of each.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Pain Score","timeFrame":"Day 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing","deltaMin":64,"sd":26},{"arm":"Closed-incision Negative Pressure Therapy","deltaMin":61,"sd":24}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":115},"commonTop":["Wound drainage","Non-healing wound"]}}
