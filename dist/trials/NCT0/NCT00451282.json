The intervention is designed to promote psychological recovery and enhance functional outcomes after injury. The study will also provide preliminary data concerning cost-effectiveness of the intervention.\n\nThe core study hypotheses are that children receiving the intervention will (1) have lower severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms at follow-up; (2) show greater adherence to discharge instructions and better health-related quality of life at follow-up, and (3) have higher rates of attendance at scheduled follow-up appointments and lower rates of emergency room utilization and re-hospitalization in the 6 months post-injury, compared to those receiving usual care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"PTSD Symptoms in Children 6 Weeks Post-injury","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":12.6,"sd":10.2},{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":13.6,"sd":10.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".69"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21594900"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":46},"commonTop":[]}}
