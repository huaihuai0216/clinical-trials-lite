To genotype natural killer (NK) cell receptors and measure their expressions at diagnosis and before reinduction, and to associate these features with treatment outcome.\n\nTo identify new prognostic factors by applying new technologies to study patient material (e.g., stored plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and normal and leukemic cells).\n\nExploratory Neuroimaging Objectives:\n\nTo use quantitative MR measures (Diffusion Tensor Imaging and high resolution volumetric imaging) to assess differences in myelin and cortical thickness development in patients treated for ALL relative to healthy controls matched for age and gender.\n\nTo assess the impact of folate pathway genetic polymorphisms on myelin and cortical thickness development and neurocognitive performance.\n\nTo assess the impact of frontal-parietal lobe myelin and cortical thickness development on neurocognitive performance in attention, working memory, fluency, visual-spatial reasoning and processing speed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Continuous Complete Remission of Patients Receiving High-dose and Conventional Dose PEG-asparaginase.","timeFrame":"3.5 years after the last enrollment up to 12.5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PEG 3500 Units/m^2","deltaMin":91.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"PEG 2500 Units/m^2","deltaMin":90.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.778"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39316653","39121442","34170389","31612640","31188727","29518185","29020310","25087182","24970932"],"seeAlso":["http://www.stjude.org","http://www.stjude.org/protocols"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":206},"commonTop":["Febrile neutropenia","Pain, Neuralgia/peripheral nerve","Fever (in the absence of neutropenia, where neutropenia is defined as ANC <1.0 x 10e9/L)","Infection with normal ANC or Grade 1 or 2 neutrophils, Upper airway NOS","Infection, Upper airway NOS"]}}
