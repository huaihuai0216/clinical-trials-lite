The study will also compare 1H-MRS of bipolar I and II patients before and after taking a 12-week course of lamotrigine.\n\nThe goal of this study was to better understand the neurobiology of bipolar depression and how lamotrigine may therapeutically impact brain function and mood response.\n\nThe hypothesis was that in comparison to non-remission participants, bipolar participants who achieve remission (defined as a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score \\<12 at week 12) associated with lamotrigine monotherapy will exhibit a greater decrease in glutamate (Glu) and an increase in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), reported as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-corrected absolute concentration percent change from baseline to endpoint in anterior cingulate (AC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score at Baseline for Both Groups, and After 12 Weeks of Lamotrigine Monotherapy for the Bipolar Group","timeFrame":"baseline, 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bipolar Group","deltaMin":27.79,"sd":5.8},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":0.3,"sd":0.64}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":29},"commonTop":["Bruise on back of head near ossiput","Swollen lymph node","Rash on left knee","Abnormal high AST level at study exit","Abnormal high GGT level at study exit"]}}
