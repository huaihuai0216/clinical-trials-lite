Of these surgeries, total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains one of the most common orthopedic procedures in the United States with approximately 300,000 operations performed annually. At our institution, post-operative analgesia in these patients is primarily provided through parenteral and oral opioid medications. Quadratus lumborum blocks (QLB) have been described and implemented for various surgical procedures including caesarean and laparoscopic ovarian surgery. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the efficacy of quadratus lumborum blocks for THA. Currently, case reports have established a precedent regarding the efficacy of the QLB for THA in providing superior analgesia and decreasing visual analog pain scores (VAS), but randomized trials are still lacking. The goal of this study is to compare pain scores (VAS), opioid consumption, physical therapy scores, and patient and surgeon satisfaction in patients that receive QLB versus no peripheral nerve blockade in patients undergoing THA. The results of this study have the potential to change standard of care for patients undergoing THA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Scores Using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores","timeFrame":"Assessed between immediately postoperatively to 12 hours postoperatively","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB)","deltaMin":2.34,"sd":0.46},{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":3.33,"sd":0.56}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31653800"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":35},"commonTop":[]}}
