PRFM has been shown to induce dermal angiogenesis, and anecdotal findings of improvement of hair appearance after PRFM injection in the scalp suggest that PRFM may play a role in the treatment of thinning hair. Patients will be treated on a monthly basis with intradermal injections of autologous PRFM for 3 months. Changes in hair density will be assessed by comparing pre- and post-treatment photographs and non-invasive measurements of hair density at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months after initial treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hair Density Change After Three Treatments","timeFrame":"6 months after initial visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment With PRFM","deltaMin":175.1,"sd":46.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
