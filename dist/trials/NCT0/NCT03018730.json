Patients treated with agalsidase alfa for at least 2 years and on a stable dose (\\>80% labelled dose/kg) for at least 6 months. Patients will be screened and evaluated over 3 months while continuing on agalsidase alfa. Following the screening period, the patient will be enrolled and switched from their agalsidase alfa treatment to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of PRX-102 1 mg/kg every two weeks for 12 months. No more than 25% of treated patients will be female.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.03","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PRX-102","deltaMin":21,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["Australia","Canada","Czechia","Netherlands","Norway","Slovenia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39847314","37865771"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":22},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Dyspnoea","Contusion","Infusion related reaction"]}}
