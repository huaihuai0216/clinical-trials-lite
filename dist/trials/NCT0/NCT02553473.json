Primary objective is to answer the question \"is two weeks doxycycline treatment (currently suggested treatment) at least as effective as six weeks doxycycline treatment in Lyme Neuroborreliosis?\".Key secondary objectives are to provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis and long-term complaints, and to search for new biomarkers in Lyme Neuroborreliosis (LNB) by collecting clinical data, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a biobank for future research\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Improvement on a composite clinical score from inclusion to six months after ended treatment defined as clinical score at inclusion minus clinical score at six months.\n\nSecondary endpoints: Improvement on a composite clinical score 12 months after ended treatment. Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), Short Form 36 (SF-36) and blood and CSF findings at inclusion, after 6 and 12 months.\n\nThe study design is a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized, penta-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 120 patients will be included from approximately 8 Norwegian hospitals.\n\nMain inclusion criteria are neurological symptoms suggestive of LNB without other obvious reasons, one or both of a) Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (\\>5 leukocytes/mm3) b) intrathecal Bb antibody Production and signed informed consent. Safety assessments during the trial: Comparison of clinical outcome six months after end of treatment between the two treatment groups. Subjective experiences and blood tests including hematology and biochemistry for four weeks after ended treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Difference in Composite Clinical Score From Inclusion to Six Months After Ended Treatment","timeFrame":"Six months after end of treatment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Doxycycline for 6 Weeks","deltaMin":6.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Doxycycline for 2 Weeks + Placebo","deltaMin":6.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":61},"commonTop":[]}}
