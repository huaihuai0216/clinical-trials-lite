The goal of this study is to determine if there are differences in clinical efficacy of BUP/NLX tablet in low dose range (less than or equal to 8/2mg) vs. high dose range (greater than or equal to 16, range 16-24mg). The main outcomes of interest will be treatment retention, use of opioids, and the use of other drugs of abuse.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Urine Toxicology for Opiate Use","timeFrame":"Weeks 1-12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Buprenorphine Low Dose","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Buprenorphine High Dose","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":[]}}
