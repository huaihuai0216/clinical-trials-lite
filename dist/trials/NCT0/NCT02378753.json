The high infectivity of blood and secretions, lack of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and challenges in following infection control and prevention protocols put healthcare workers at high risk during outbreaks, and direct contact with the bodies of deceased Ebola victims can also sustain community transmission. This study will accelerate introduction and use of monovalent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Ebola vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV) among healthcare workers and frontline personnel involved in the Ebola outbreak response in Sierra Leone, while concurrently evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.\n\nThis is an unblinded, randomized trial with phased vaccine introduction in the target population. Participation in the study will be voluntary and open to adults 18 years of age and older who are at high risk of exposure to Ebola infection through their daily work and who work in a selected study area.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Laboratory-confirmed Ebola (Study Diagnostics)","timeFrame":"> 21 days following vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"rVSVΔG-ZEBOV (Immediate Vaccination)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"rVSVΔG-ZEBOV (Deferred Vaccination)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["Sierra Leone"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36208978","32017677","29788349","29788348","29788347","29788346","29788345","29788343","29788342","29788341","29788340","29788339","28647166"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":54,"n":4261},"commonTop":["Headache","Pain","Arthralgia","Pyrexia","Feeling hot"]}}
