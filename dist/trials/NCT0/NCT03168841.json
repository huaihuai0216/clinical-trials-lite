Nearly 26 million Americans suffer from diabetes, and approximately one-third of subjects with diabetes have toenail onychomycosis. Numerous studies have addressed the efficacy and safety of both topical and oral antifungal treatment options for onychomycosis in diabetic subjects. However, no study to date has specifically addressed the efficacy and safety of efinaconazole among diabetic subjects.\n\nThe objective of this noncomparative, uncontrolled study is to determine the efficacy of topical efinaconazole 10% for toenail onychomycosis among subjects with diabetes mellitus. Specific indicators to measure efficacy of treatment will be the mycological cure rate, complete cure rate, and treatment success. Furthermore, an additional goal of the study is to gain knowledge of safety in the setting of a cohort of diabetic subjects","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary Endpoint - Efficacy","timeFrame":"50 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention Group, Receiving Medication","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Application site vesicles, local"]}}
