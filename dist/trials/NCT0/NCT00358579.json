Historically intravenous adrenaline has been the drug of choice since 1906. There have been few formal evaluations to determine the value of adrenaline for cardiac arrest, and clinical trials have not been able to show any benefit with intravenous adrenaline (compared to placebo or no treatment) in the field.\n\nThus the purpose of this study is to compare vasopressin and adrenaline in the treatment of cardiac arrest to answer the question whether there is an improvement in survival between vasopressin and adrenaline.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Survival to Hospital Discharge.","timeFrame":"at 30 days post arrest","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Adrenaline","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vasopressin","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"17 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22353644"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
