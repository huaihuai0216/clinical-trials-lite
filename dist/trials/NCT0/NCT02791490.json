The primary hypothesis of this study is that up-titration of metformin to 2000 mg/day (1000 mg/twice a day) plus the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg/day provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (A1C) compared to metformin up-titration alone. Another primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1C at Week 20","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 20","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.69,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["30609212"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":229},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea"]}}
