Much research is currently being directed at identifying ways to reduce this risk. Reduction of the dose of soybean-based lipid given as a component of parenteral nutrition is one possible strategy. In this study we will compare standard dosing of soybean-based lipid (up to 3/kg/day) with a minimized dose (1 g/kg/day) and evaluate for the development of cholestasis and adequate growth between the two groups. Longterm followup will include an assessment of neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 and 24 months of age.\n\nFunding source - FDA OOPD","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Rise of Direct Bilirubin as a Function of Time","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Reduced Lipid","deltaMin":1.033001353,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Lipid","deltaMin":1.05457485,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":12},"commonTop":["Line Complication, Removal, or Replacement","Tachycardia","Bradycardia with Tachypnea","Hyperglycemia","Hypertension"]}}
