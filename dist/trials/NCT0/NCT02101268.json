After discontinuation of study medication, assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of enrollment or until study termination. For those subjects planning to continue treatment with MMB following the end of the study, the End of Treatment, 30-day, 12-Week, and survival follow-up visits are not required.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Splenic Response Rate at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Momelotinib (MMB)","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Best Available Therapy (BAT)","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.90"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["United States","Canada","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40535755","39516087","38990433","37042865","29275119"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":37,"n":104},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Asthenia","Cough","Anaemia","Pyrexia"]}}
