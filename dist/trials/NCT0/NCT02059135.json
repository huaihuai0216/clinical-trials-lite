Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the difference in extension of gestational age from the time of randomization into the study until delivery between ATryn and placebo treated subjects. In addition, the effect of ATryn on fetal and neonatal clinical outcomes will be assessed. The PK characteristics of ATryn in the subjects will be investigated by measuring AT activity levels in the mother during treatment and in cord blood.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Increase in Gestational Age in Days","timeFrame":"Subjects will continue on study drug until maternal and/or fetal indications for delivery necessitate cessation of expectant management or until 34 0/7 weeks of gestation.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Recombinant Human Antithrombin (ATryn)","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Normal Saline 0.9%","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32780999","26886785"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":60},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Headache","Pre-eclampsia","Infusion site extravasation","Back pain"]}}
