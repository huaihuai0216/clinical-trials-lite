Eprosartan belongs to a class of blood pressure lowering agents used worldwide since years with proven efficacy. The new formulation is compared to the currently marketed eprosartan tablet. Equivalent efficacy in blood pressure lowering effects should be demonstrated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Assess the Therapeutic Equivalence of Eprosartan (a New Formulation Containing Only the Active Moiety Eprosartan) With Eprosartan Mesylate (Currently Marketed Formulation) on Change of Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) From Baseline","timeFrame":"8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Eprosartan","deltaMin":-7.4,"sd":7.7},{"arm":"Eprosartan Mesylate","deltaMin":-7.2,"sd":7.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["Germany","Russia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":332},"commonTop":["NASOPHARYNGITIS"]}}
