Zoledronic acid is given as a single intravenous infusion. Alendronate is given as a weekly pill. Both are expected to be very effective, but it is not known which one will work best.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change From Baseline in Total Hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at 12 Months","timeFrame":"Baseline, 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Zoledronic Acid and Placebo Alendronate","deltaMin":0.39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Zoledronic Acid and Active Alendronate","deltaMin":-0.21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Reference Group","deltaMin":-2.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["14973216","23024190"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":41},"commonTop":["Infection","Hypocalcemia","Serum Calcium > 2.0 mg/dL","Rejection","Flu-like symptoms after zoledronate or matching placebo"]}}
