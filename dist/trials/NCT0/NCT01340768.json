The primary hypothesis is that during the 30 days of Ramadan fasting, treatment with sitagliptin (with or without metformin) compared to SU treatment (with or without metformin) results in a lower incidence of hypoglycemia in participants with T2DM.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With at Least One Symptomatic Hypoglycemic Event","timeFrame":"Up to 30 days (Day 1 through last day of Ramadan)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":3.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sulfonylurea Therapy","deltaMin":7.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.028"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["37435938","22738801"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":421},"commonTop":["Hypoglycemia"]}}
