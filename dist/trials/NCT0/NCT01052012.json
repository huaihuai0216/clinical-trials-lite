SABER-Bupivacaine is designed to continuously deliver bupivacaine, a common local anesthetic, for a few days in order to treat local post-surgical pain.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate safety (side effects) associated with the use of SABER-Bupivacaine and how well it works in reducing pain and opioid-related side effects following various kinds of abdominal surgeries.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Pain Intensity on Movement","timeFrame":"0 to 72 hours post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort 1-POSIMIR","deltaMin":4.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 1-Bupivacaine HCl","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2-POSIMIR","deltaMin":2.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2-Bupivacaine HCl","deltaMin":3.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 3-POSIMIR","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 3-Placebo","deltaMin":5.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1473"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0601"},{"comp":"OG004 vs OG005","p":"0.1483"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Australia","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":30},"commonTop":["Nausea","Application site discolouration","Vomiting","Constipation","Abdominal distension"]}}
