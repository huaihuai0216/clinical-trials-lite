The study hypothesis is that citalopram will be better than placebo in producing clinical improvement and reductions in abdominal pain. It is also hypothesized that citalopram and placebo will not differ in terms of safety and tolerability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) Will be Used to Assess Overall Global Illness Improvement.
