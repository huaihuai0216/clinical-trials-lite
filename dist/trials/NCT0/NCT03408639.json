Administration dose for patients who are treated with erythropoietin is the similar dose of the previously administered amount (IV or SC without any change). After then, dose adjustment will be made based on patients' response. The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of CinnaPoietin® with Eprex®. The secondary objectives of this study are further comparison and evaluation of efficacy along with safety between CinnaPoietin® and Eprex®.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Hb Change Level During the Last Four Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"Week 22 to week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CinnaPoietin®","deltaMin":0.4,"sd":1.26},{"arm":"Eprex®","deltaMin":0.74,"sd":1.39}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Iran"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12076240","18498676","4982112","15206425","15758012","15327419","8555638","4825851","18922994","10469862","7645533","699405","9387132","6645029","49205","577960","18525001","11316241","20019121","7611266","8643170","8914038","11863124","14640239","18845368","8716991","8739277","11427634","16316362","1902285","18212498","20439566","20189050","20031287","20133033","20843249","30253403"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":78},"commonTop":["(Palpitation, Cardiac Function Impairment, Cardiac Infraction, Chest Pain, Tachycardia)","(Skin reaction, Catheter defect, Disability catheter, Filter clots, pain in injection site, skin rea","(numbness in the wrist, dizziness)","(Respiratory disorder, chest pain and dyspenea, dyspnea)","(itching, echymosis due to recent car accident, itching)"]}}
