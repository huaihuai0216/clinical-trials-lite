The efficacy and safety of the drug will be tested against a placebo treatment. The primary criterion to assess efficacy will be the difference between the serial lung function measurements of patients who have been treated for 12 weeks with NVA237 versus those that have received placebo treatment for 12 weeks. A serial lung function measurement (FEV1 testing) will be conducted and the \"area under the curve\" will be the measure for the ability to breathe.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Standardized Area Under the Curve for Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second Post Dosing","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NVA237","deltaMin":0.115,"sd":0.0153},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.008,"sd":0.0153}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":59,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28848879"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":216},"commonTop":["CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE","COUGH","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","HEADACHE","NASOPHARYNGITIS"]}}
