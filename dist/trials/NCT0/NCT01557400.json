It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability during childhood and teenage years. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of DBMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study comprises a Phase 3, open-label study of ataluren in participants with nmDBMD who previously received ataluren at an Investigator site in a prior PTC-sponsored clinical study. A separate open-label study (PTC124-GD-016-DMD; NCT01247207) is being conducted for nmDBMD participants who previously received ataluren at an Investigator site in the United States (US).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Baseline up to Week 246","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ataluren","deltaMin":91,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Australia","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17450125","17389552","34791888"],"seeAlso":["https://filehosting-v2.pharmacm.com/api/Attachment/Download?tenantId=80217411&amp;parentIdentifier=PTC124-GD-019-DMD&amp;attachmentIdentifier=0c3d8df5-876e-4f54-9b71-fcb919b589e6&amp;fileName=PTC124-019-CSR-002514_1.0_PTC124-GD-019-DMD_Final_CSR_16-2-9_CINRG_Listing.pdf&amp;versionIdentifier="]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":94},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Vomiting","Disease progression","Fall"]}}
