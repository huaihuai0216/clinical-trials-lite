Fast-acting insulin aspart will be tested to see how well it works and if it is safe. Participants will get either fast-acting insulin aspart or NovoRapid®/ NovoLog® - which treatment you get is decided by chance. Both medicines will be taken together with insulin degludec. Participants will need to take 1 injection 4 times every day (all insulins will be provided in pens). The study will last for about 8 months (34 weeks).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Week 0, week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Faster Aspart","deltaMin":-0.15,"sd":0.62},{"arm":"NovoRapid","deltaMin":-0.09,"sd":0.6}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.310"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":167,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Bulgaria","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Germany","Greece","Italy","Poland","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32209647","35290624"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":544},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}
