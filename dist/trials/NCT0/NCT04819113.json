Current posology allows for 2 doses of Nimenrix before 6 months of age, where the first dose is administered from 6 weeks onwards with a second dose at least 2 months later, with a booster at 12 months; and in infants from 6 months of age, a single dose at 6 months, with a booster dose at 12 months.
