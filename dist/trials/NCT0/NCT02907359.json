This global study will be conducted in approximately 15 countries. Approximately 408 participants from approximately 100 study centers will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either guadecitabine (approximately 272 participants) or Treatment Choice (approximately 136 participants). The study consists of a 21-day screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up visit, and a long-term follow-up period. The study is expected to last more than 2 years, and the duration of individual participant participation will vary. Participants may continue to receive treatment for as long as they continue to benefit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"From randomization up to death (up to approximately 38.6 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Guadecitabine","deltaMin":277,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment Choice","deltaMin":252,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.6063"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Poland","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":216,"n":270},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Thrombocytopenia","Anaemia","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea"]}}
