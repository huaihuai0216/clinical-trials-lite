Despite these findings, there have been no studies examining the impact of hypovitaminosis D in specialized neurocritical care units (NCCU). Given the often significant differences in the management of patients in NCCU and more generalized intensive care units there is a need for further inquiries into the impact of low vitamin D levels in this specific environment. This study proposes a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single center evaluation of vitamin D supplementation in the emergent NCCU patient population. The primary outcome will involve length-of-stay for emergent neurocritical care patients. Various secondary outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, ICU length-of-stay, Glasgow Outcome Score on discharge, complications and quality-of-life metrics. Patients will be followed for 6 months post-discharge.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Intent-to-treat Hospital Length-of-stay","timeFrame":"Until discharge","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vitamin D3","deltaMin":10.9,"sd":15.6},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":9.1,"sd":7.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27367248","31518987","31518978"],"seeAlso":["http://medicine.utah.edu/neurosurgery/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":134},"commonTop":[]}}
