The study of the receptors by quantitative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels and immunohistochemistry analysis might end with a better understanding of these tumors. Besides that, it will be assessed the in vitro and in vivo responses to pasireotide (for NFPA and prolactinomas) and cabergoline (for NFPA). These responses will be compared with the receptor expressions which may be a tool as a predicting element of the response to these compounds.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tumor Volume Changes for NFPA and Prolactin Level Changes for Prolactinoma","timeFrame":"Baseline to six months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pasireotide","deltaMin":3.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cabergoline","deltaMin":29.35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Brazil"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Hyperglycemia","Diarrhea"]}}
