In most cases, by the time it has been diagnosed it has spread to other organs in the body and the chance of a cure is very small. The standard treatment for gastric cancer is a combination of chemotherapy drugs.\n* Researchers are interested in finding out if surgically removing all tumors before beginning chemotherapy for stomach cancer can slow or halt its spread better than giving chemotherapy alone.\n\nObjectives:\n\n\\- To determine whether tumor removal surgery followed by chemotherapy is more effective in treating gastric cancer than chemotherapy given alone.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Patients 18 years of age and older who have been diagnosed with gastric cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\n* All patients will undergo an initial physical examination, blood tests, imaging scans, and a laparoscopy to determine the extent of the disease.\n* Half of the participants will be assigned to have surgery first and then chemotherapy; the other half will be assigned to have chemotherapy alone.\n\n  * The surgery-plus-chemotherapy group will have major surgery to remove all tumors in the stomach and abdominal area, followed by a recovery time of up to 4 weeks. Chemotherapy will begin 6 to 8 weeks after surgery.\n  * The chemotherapy-only group will begin treatment within 2 weeks of laparoscopy.\n* All patients will receive four chemotherapy drugs: 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. The drugs are given intravenously over 2 days every 2 weeks (one cycle) for 12 cycles (about 6 months), either at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center or at home with a referring oncologist. Patients in the surgery group who have tumors in the peritoneum will receive an additional set of chemotherapy drugs in a separate treatment.\n* During the chemotherapy cycles, patients will provide blood samples approximately once a week and will have physical examinations and scans on a regular basis.\n* Patients will return to the NIH Clinical Center for follow-up visits about every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years and yearly thereafter.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival in Patients With Limited Metastatic Gastric Carcinoma: Arm I","timeFrame":"12 weeks up to 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Surgery + HIPEC + Systemic Chemotherapy","deltaMin":19,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["8433390","15454251","12773978","25042700","20881648","20030854"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":8},"commonTop":["AST, SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase)","CPK (creatine phosphokinase)","Nausea","Neuropathy: sensory","Neutrophils/granulocytes (ANC/AGC)"]}}
