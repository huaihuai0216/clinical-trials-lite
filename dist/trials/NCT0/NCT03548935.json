Participants will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment participants get, is decided by chance. Participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study has two phases: A main phase and an extension phase.The main phase will last for about 1.5 years. Participants will have 15 clinic visits and 10 phone calls with the study doctor. Extension phase: Approximately 300 participants will continue in the extension phase in the following countries only: Canada, Germany, the UK and selected sites in the US and Japan. These participants will be in the study for about 2.5 years.They will not receive treatment, but will attend another 5 follow-up visits with the study doctor.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight (%)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0) to week 68","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-15.6,"sd":10.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.8,"sd":6.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":128,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","India","Japan","Mexico","Poland","Puerto Rico","Russia","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32441473","33567185","39316288","39226070","36876594","36801984","36200477","35724304","35441470","30122305"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":128,"n":1306},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Constipation","Vomiting"]}}
