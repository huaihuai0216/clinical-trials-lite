Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab are more effective than carboplatin, paclitaxel, and placebo in treating ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"From study entry until first disease progression, death or date of last contact, up to 6 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Placebo, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Placebo, Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, Bevacizumab)","deltaMin":12.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm III (Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, Bevacizumab)","deltaMin":15.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.448"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":632,"countries":["United States","Canada","Japan","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37185961","36252167","35144591","31216226","29550184","26487588","23219660","22204724","21941283"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":239,"n":621},"commonTop":["Neutrophils","Leukocytes","Hemoglobin","Fatigue","Hair Loss/Alopecia (Scalp Or Body)"]}}
