Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways after surgery may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating older women with breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens to see how well they work in treating older women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Relapse-free Survival Rates at 2.4 Years","timeFrame":"randomization until date of first event, or date last known to be event free if no event was reported (up to 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard Chemotherapy","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"Capecitabine","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":334,"countries":["United States","Canada","Peru"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19702447","20368559","19439741","34037241","31339827","31034595","29602735","29233548"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":131},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Hemoglobin decreased","Leukocyte count decreased","Diarrhea"]}}
