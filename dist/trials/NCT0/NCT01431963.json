During the escalation phase, the investigational product is administered orally at 25 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 50 mg/day for 2 weeks and finally 100 mg/day for 2 weeks. During the maintenance phase, 200 mg/day is administered orally for 24 weeks. However, the dose can be decreased to 100 mg/day if there are safety concerns. Also, if it is confirmed that the seizures cannot be controlled at the dose of 200 mg/day, the dose can be gradually increased up to 400 mg/day by 50-100 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week. As a rule, lamotrigine should be administered once daily (in the evening), but the dose exceeding 200 mg/day can be administered in two divided doses (in the morning and evening). After the completion of maintenance phase, Japanese subjects who have responded to lamotrigine without tolerability issues are eligible to enter an extension phase of the study if indicated, until either approval of this indication (monotherapy in epilepsy) or after 24 months after LSLV (Last Subject's Last Visit) of the maintenance phase, whichever is sooner.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Were Seizure Free in the Maintenance Phase (Across Seizure Types and by Seizure Type Within 6 Months Prior to the Start of the Study)","timeFrame":"Weeks 7 to 30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lamotrigine","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["Japan","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":65},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Rash","Nausea","Dizziness"]}}
