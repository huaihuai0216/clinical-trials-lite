Participants could have received one prior hormonal treatment for MBC. Participants may have received systemic breast cancer treatment in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting, provided that the participant had experienced a disease-free interval (DFI) of greater than or equal to (â‰¥)12 months from completion of adjuvant systemic treatment (excluding hormonal therapy) to metastatic diagnosis. Participants may have received trastuzumab and/or a taxane during the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.\n\nParticipants were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either pertuzumab or placebo, along with trastuzumab and docetaxel once every 3 weeks (q3w), during the treatment phase of the study until investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical progressive disease, unmanageable toxicity, or study termination. Participants in the Placebo arm were not allowed to receive open-label pertuzumab after discontinuation from study treatment. However, if any analysis of overall survival had met the predefined criteria for statistical significance, participants in the Placebo arm still on treatment were offered the option to receive open-label pertuzumab in addition to other study medications.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Determined by an Independent Review Facility","timeFrame":"Tumor assessments every 9 weeks from randomization to IRF-determined PD or death from any cause, whichever occurred first, up to the primary completion date (up to 3 years, 3 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel","deltaMin":18.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel","deltaMin":12.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":322,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","China","Costa Rica","Croatia","Ecuador","Finland","France","Germany","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Mexico","North Macedonia","Philippines","Poland","Russia","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22149875","32171426","29112701","28057664","27964843","25693012","25332247","24685829","24129974","23868905","23602601","21147694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":116,"n":396},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Alopecia","Neutropenia","Nausea","Fatigue"]}}
