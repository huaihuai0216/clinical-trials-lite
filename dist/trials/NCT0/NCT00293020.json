The standard of care for these breakthrough pain episodes is a rapid onset, short acting analgesic with minimal associated sleepiness. Oral morphine, oxycodone and hydromorphone are routinely used, but because of slow and variable oral absorption, the pain control is not the best with these products. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) has been used successfully in treating breakthrough pain episodes associated with cancer. OTFC is a lozenge of fentanyl on a stick and is administered by continuously swabbing the interior of the subject's mouth until the product is dissolved (approximately 15 to 30 minutes). The buccal route of administration avoids the delay and variability associated with oral absorption.\n\nBioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI) has developed BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive) fentanyl, an alternative product to OTFC that does not require the subject to continuously paint the inside of the mouth with the dosage form. The BDSI product is a small disc that is placed against the mucosal membrane inside the mouth. The mucoadhesive polymers in the disc readily adhere to the mucosal membrane (within 5 seconds) when moistened. The components of the disc are water soluble, so the entire dosage form dissolves within 30 minutes of application.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events.","timeFrame":"Participants were followed for the duration of the study, an average of 126 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Open Label Fentanyl Treatment","deltaMin":88.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":121,"n":243},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Dizziness","Anemia","Edema peripheral"]}}
