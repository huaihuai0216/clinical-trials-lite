Eligible subjects who complete the 12-week treatment period in Study TRCA-301 have the option to participate in this extension study evaluating the long-term safety and durability of effect of TRC101 in subjects with non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis. Eligible subjects will be treated with TRC101 or placebo once daily (QD) on an out-patient basis for the subsequent 40 weeks. Subjects will continue to receive the same blinded treatment (TRC101 or placebo) that they received in Study TRCA-301.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal.","timeFrame":"Week 12 Visit in the parent study, TRCA-301, to the Week 54 Visit in the extension study, TRCA-301E.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TRC101 Treatment Arm","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Treatment Arm","deltaMin":1.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Georgia","Hungary","Serbia","Slovenia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31248662","35216581"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":112},"commonTop":["Headache","Hyperkalaemia","Influenza","Flatulence","Diarrhoea"]}}
