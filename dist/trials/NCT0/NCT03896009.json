AXS-07 tablets are formulated to provide an enhanced rate of absorption of meloxicam. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AXS-07 compared to meloxicam, rizatriptan, and placebo for the treatment of a migraine attack.\n\nThis is a randomized, double-blind, 4-arm, parallel group, single-dose, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects who successfully complete screening and continue to meet all entry criteria will be randomly assigned to take one dose of either AXS-07, meloxicam, rizatriptan, or placebo upon the occurrence of a qualifying migraine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects Reporting Headache Pain Freedom","timeFrame":"Hour 2 following dose administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AXS-07","deltaMin":85,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":85,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.axsome.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":441},"commonTop":["All Others, occurring in <1% of Subjects","Nausea","Somnolence","Dizziness"]}}
