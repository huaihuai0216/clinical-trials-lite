Our hypothesis was that SBBO is an important contributor to the development of weight loss in individuals with PD. The investigators proposed to 1) examine the role of SBBO in weight loss occurring in patients with PD and 2) determine the response to its treatment with a poorly absorbed antibiotic. The investigators performed a prospective, observational case-control study (Part 1) with an open-label therapeutic component (Part 2). Cases were defined as those PD patients who experienced significant weight loss while Controls were defined as those PD patients who did not experience significant weight loss.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth (SBBO)","timeFrame":"Baseline to 2 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Case Group","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":12,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"1.0"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":8},"commonTop":["Hyperglycemia","Loose stool","Diarrhea","Shoulder joint repair"]}}
