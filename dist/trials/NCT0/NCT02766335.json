This is a \"non-match\" sub-study that includes all screened patients not eligible for a biomarker-driven sub-study. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may be able to shrink tumors. Durvalumab may be effective in treating patients with squamous cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Response Rate in MEDI4736-treated Participants","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years post registration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (MEDI4736 - Closed to Accrual 12/2015)","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":36,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":993,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":68},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Anemia","Nausea","Anorexia","Dyspnea"]}}
