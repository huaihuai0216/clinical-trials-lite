The investigators will also conduct pre- and post-treatment neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging \\[fMRI\\] and hydrogen magnetic resonance spectroscopy \\[HMRS\\]) to assess neural functional deficits in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder compared to healthy volunteer adolescents. This pre- and post-neuroimaging will also be used to assess any effects of memantine therapy on neural function in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. The investigators hypothesize that short-term memantine monotherapy will be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in improving the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that following memantine therapy, adolescents with autism spectrum disorder will exhibit a decrease in glutamate (Glu) concentration in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a change towards normalization in altered functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobes, consistent with improvement in social impairments in autism spectrum disorder. The investigators hypothesize that compared to healthy volunteer participants, participants with autism spectrum disorder will significantly differ on neuroimaging measures at baseline but that following memantine therapy, the difference between autism spectrum disorder and healthy volunteer neuroimaging data will decrease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Responder","timeFrame":"12 Weeks (from Baseline [Week 0] to Endpoint [Week 12])","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Memantine","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37811711","36006807"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Headache","Insomnia","Anxious/Worried","Cold/Infection/Allergy","Fatigue"]}}
