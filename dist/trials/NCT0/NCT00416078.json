Veterans with a clinical diagnosis of ADRD and their caregiver/relatives will be randomized to receive one of two interventions: (1) customary care (cc) and access to an intensive, interactive online education and support website intervention for 6 months, or (2) cc and monthly brief telephone calls with project staff for six month. It is hypothesized that participation in the intensive intervention will result in a reductions in patient problematic behavior and caregiver responses to it, reduced caregiver burden and depression, and improved medication adherence at the end of treatment, and more patients remaining at home through the 12 months post-randomization period..","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Caregiver Burden From Baseline","timeFrame":"baseline to end-of-treatment (6 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Caregiver Website","deltaMin":32.04,"sd":1.95},{"arm":"Caregiver Phone Calls","deltaMin":28.59,"sd":2.01}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".51"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22662739","33417236"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":29},"commonTop":[]}}
