Fluvoxamine is an anti-depressant drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The use of fluvoxamine for the treatment of COVID-19 is considered investigational, which means the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved it for this use.\n\nThis study is fully-remote, which means that there is no face-to-face contact; study materials including study drug will be shipped to participants' houses. People around the United States and Canada can participate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Clinical Deterioration","timeFrame":"RCT-approximately 15 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fluvoxamine","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37622035"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":272},"commonTop":["Nausea/vomitting"]}}
