Droxidopa is being studied to determine the effects on blood pressure changes upon standing up (orthostatic challenge). Symptoms and activity measurements, including patient reported falls, will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the study drug.\n\nSymptoms of NOH may include any of the following:\n\n* Dizziness, light-headedness, feeling faint or feeling like you may blackout\n* Problems with vision (blurring, seeing spots, tunnel vision, etc.)\n* Weakness\n* Fatigue\n* Trouble concentrating\n* Head \\& neck discomfort (the coat hanger syndrome)\n* Difficulty standing for a short time or a long time\n* Trouble walking for a short time or a long time\n\nThe study duration is a maximum of approximately 14 weeks including up to 2 weeks for screening, up to 2 weeks for proper dose finding, followed by an 8 week treatment period and a follow-up visit after 2 weeks. A sufficient number of patients will be screened to allow approximately 211 randomized patients. An extension study is also available to continue treatment if determined appropriate by the study doctor. This Study is NCT01132326 sponsored by Chelsea Therapeutics and is enrolling by invitation only.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"306A Efficacy: Change in Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire Score (OHQ)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Droxidopa","deltaMin":-2.2,"sd":2.44},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.1,"sd":2.49}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.978"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":60,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["6420517","12815652","12835329","3133573","12885750","9513205","30003579","28494751","27538531","24326693"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":114},"commonTop":["Headache","Contusion","Dizziness","Nausea","Skin laceration"]}}
