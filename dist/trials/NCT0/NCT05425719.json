Adults with kidney function ranging from normal to Stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and participants spanning the entire range of human skin colors as defined by the Fitzpatrick Skin Scale (FSS) were included in the study.\n\nThe main questions that the study aimed to answer were:\n\n* To establish that the MB-102 transdermal fluorescence measured GFR using the MediBeacon Transdermal GFR Measurement System is comparable to the measured MB-102 plasma GFR\n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of MB-102 in study participants\n* To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MediBeacon Transdermal GFR Measurement System (TGFR) for the non-invasive transdermal fluorescence detection of MB-102 in participants\n\nParticipants had a transdermal sensor placed on their upper chest, and the TGFR collected background fluorescence. Participants then received a single dose of MB-102. Blood samples were collected and fluorescent measurements were taken over a 12- to 24-hour period. Following completion of the treatment period, participants returned to the study center approximately 1 week later for a safety follow-up visit. Researchers compared the results to see if the transdermal GFR measurements were comparable to the measured plasma GFR in those with and without normal kidney function and different skin coloration.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Transdermal Derived Glomerular Filtration Rate (tGFR) Values Within 30% of the nGFR Plasma-derived Indexed Glomerular Filtration Rate (nGFR) Values","timeFrame":"Up to 24 hours following the study dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"eGFR ≥ 70 mL/Min/1.73 m^2","deltaMin":0.96,"sd":null},{"arm":"eGFR < 70 mL/Min/1.73 m^2","deltaMin":0.92,"sd":null},{"arm":"All Participants","deltaMin":0.94,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37104481"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":130},"commonTop":["Headache","Cardiac murmur","Ecchymosis","Hypertension"]}}
