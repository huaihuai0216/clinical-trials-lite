SSI following adult spinal surgery is a frequent complication that has been reported to occur in 0.7-12.0% of patients and result in higher postoperative morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Vanderbilt University Medical Center SSI rate is 7%. Treatment for SSI can be challenging often requiring revision surgery, long-term antibiotics, and prolonged hospitalization. The accurate identification of risk factors is thus important in the development of strategies to prevent these potentially devastating infections. This study proposes a randomized, controlled trial of neuro-spine patients of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate skin preparation cloths for the prevention of post op surgical site infections in spine patients.\n\nUse of CHG cloths the night before and morning of surgery (neckline to toes) will affect (decrease rates) of SSI compared to patients who receive routine standard of care (soap and water pre-op, day of surgery and daily post-operative).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Surgical Site Infection Development at 30 Days Post-operative","timeFrame":"post op day 30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care Pre-operative Cleansing","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"2% Chlorhexidine Gluconate","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.456"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["8547767","8893444","5012590","4722945","4584242","9507627","2053001","12650399","8539047","8059266","17436915","18303461","20066445","19478664","19494763","22889522","23388005","23363666"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":76},"commonTop":[]}}
