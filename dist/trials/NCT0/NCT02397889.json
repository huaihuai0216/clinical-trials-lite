Current treatments for PTSD do not work for everyone and it can take time to determine whether a person responds to a chosen treatment. The purpose of this study is to see whether ketamine, when given repeatedly intravenously can produce a quick and persistent improvement in PTSD symptoms. At higher doses, ketamine has been used for many years as an anesthetic for medical procedures, and at lower doses may be an effective treatment in patients with major depression and PTSD. Ketamine given for PTSD is investigational, which means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for treating this condition. In this study, the effects of ketamine will be compared to those of midazolam. Midazolam has similar acute anesthetic effects compared to ketamine but has not been shown to treat or alleviate any symptoms of PTSD. This makes midazolam an appropriate substance to gauge whether ketamine can treat or alleviate PTSD symptoms thereby acting as what we call an active control.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)","timeFrame":"2 weeks after the first infusion","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Ketamine Group","deltaMin":22.5,"sd":14.4},{"arm":"Active Control Midazolam Group","deltaMin":33.2,"sd":11.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33397139"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Other","Fatigue","Nausea/Vomiting","Headache","Blurred vision"]}}
