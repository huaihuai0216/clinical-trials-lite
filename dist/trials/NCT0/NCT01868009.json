Subjects will have an equal chance of being in any of the following two groups (1:1 allocation). One group will be dispensed the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 1 to use during the first period (once daily for 5 to9 days), and the DISKUS inhaler at Visit 2 to use during the second period (twice daily for 5 to 9 days). The other group will be dispensed the DISKUS inhaler at Visit 1 to use during the first period (twice daily for 5 to 9 days), and the ELLIPTA inhaler at Visit 2 to use during the second period (once daily for 5 to9 days). At the end of the second period, subjects will complete the study by answering 7 questions to assess their preference of device attributes and dosing regimens between the two inhalers.\n\nThe null hypothesis for device preference for a specific attribute is that 50% subjects express a preference in that attribute for ELLIPTA and 50% do NOT express a preference in that attribute for ELLIPTA, i.e., the odds for preferring ELLIPTA to not preferring ELLIPTA is unity.\n\nThe null hypothesis for dosing regimen preference is that 50% subjects express a preference of once daily dosing and 50% do not express a preference of once daily dosing (prefer twice daily dosing or have no preference).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With the Indicated Device Preference Based on the Size of the Numbers on the Dose Counter","timeFrame":"up to Study Day 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DISKUS BID in Period 1; ELLIPTA QD in Period 2","deltaMin":107,"sd":null},{"arm":"ELLIPTA QD in Period 1; DISKUS BID in Period 2","deltaMin":86,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":16,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26516724"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":287},"commonTop":["Headache","Back pain","Diarrhoea","Dry mouth","Neck pain"]}}
