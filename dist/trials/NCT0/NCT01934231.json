The principal bacterial pathogens in causing ABRS include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. These three bacteria account for approximately 90% of ABRS in children less than or equal to 5 years of age. Combination of Potassium Clavulanate (CVA) and Amoxicillin (AMPC) produces higher antibiotic activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The present study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety of CVA/AMPC (1:14) administered in children aged from 3 months to less than 15 years with ABRS. It is an open-label study consisting of a 7-day treatment phase and a post-treatment follow-up phase for 7 to 14 days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Clinical Outcome of \"Cure\" at Test of Cure (TOC: Day 15)","timeFrame":"Day 15","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CVA/AMPC (1:14)","deltaMin":23,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Otitis media"]}}
