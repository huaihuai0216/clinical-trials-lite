An additional substudy will examine the safety and PK of subcutaneous (SC) administration of rIX-FP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Number of Participants Who Developed Inhibitors Against Factor IX (FIX)","timeFrame":"For PTPs: up to 5 years or the time it takes to achieve 100 exposure days (EDs).
