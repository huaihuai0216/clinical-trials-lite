It will compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Chronocort® with standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy in the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) over a treatment period of 6 months. Dose titration decisions in both treatment groups will be made by a central independent physician, blinded to the treatment arm, using information generated from the 24-hour endocrine profiles. Each treatment arm will be subject to the same titration rules throughout the study, ensuring that opportunities for optimisation and control of androgens are the same in both groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks of the Mean of the 24-hour Standard Deviation Score (SDS) Profile for 17-OHP","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Chronocort®","deltaMin":-0.403,"sd":0.8499},{"arm":"Standard Glucocorticoid Therapy","deltaMin":-0.172,"sd":0.7776}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.5521"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33527139"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":61},"commonTop":["Headache","Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Fatigue","Pyrexia","Nausea"]}}
