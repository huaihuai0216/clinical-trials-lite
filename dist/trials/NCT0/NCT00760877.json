The study also explored the impact and significance of the achieved CMR on patient outcomes (progression free survival (PFS), event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), characterized the kinetics of CMR achieved in both treatment arms and after the cross-over.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Confirmed Best Cumulative Complete Molecular Response (CMR)","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nilotinib","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Imatinib","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1083"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","France","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24948656"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":101},"commonTop":["HEADACHE","RASH","NAUSEA","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","LIPASE INCREASED"]}}
