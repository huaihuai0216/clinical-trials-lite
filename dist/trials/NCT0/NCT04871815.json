The symptoms include hypoxemia (low SaO2), fatigue, coughing/sneezing, dyspnea, trouble breathing, body aches, headaches. This chronic disease is referred to as COVID-19 Long Haulers. 7-10% of COVID-19 long haulers are also at serious risk of developing Pulmonary Fibrosis. Conversely, patients with Pulmonary Fibrosis have an increased risk and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, which can reach a mortality rate of 50%. In a Phase III Clinical Trial in patients in Pulmonary Fibrosis and Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the inhalation of the sodium pyruvate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant improvement in all lung functions, compared to baseline, including an increase in FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (from 52% to 86%) and a reduction in coughing and fatigue. EmphyCorp/Cellular Sciences Inc. has submitted over 17 human clinicals (Phase I, II, III including animal safety data) to the FDA, demonstrating that the inhalation of sodium pyruvate, significantly reduced respiratory and nasal Inflammation, including oxygen radicals and inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, that causes the so-called cytokine storm COVID-19 patients. Thousands of patients treated with inhaled sodium pyruvate including patients with COPD, Pulmonary Fibrosis, CF, Allergic Rhinitis, Chronic Rhinitis, Sinusitis, and Flu, demonstrated statistically and clinically significant improvement in lung functions with no adverse events reported. This study will examine the effects of N115 (Sodium pyruvate nasal spray) treatment on the symptoms associated with COVID-19 Long Haulers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in the Symptoms of Long COVID-19 Patients","timeFrame":"14 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Long COVID-19, Treatment With 20mM Sodium Pyruvate Nasal Spray","deltaMin":20.33,"sd":4.933},{"arm":"Long COVID-19, No Treatment (Baseline)","deltaMin":27,"sd":5.568}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.200"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0326"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0043"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0003"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3714"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.300"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2286"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.999"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32634445"],"seeAlso":["http://emphycorp.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":[]}}
