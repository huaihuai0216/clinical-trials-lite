Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, mitomycin, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by carrying drugs directly into blood vessels near the tumor and then blocking the blood flow to allow a higher concentration of the drug to reach the tumor for a longer period of time. Kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. It is not yet known whether giving chemoembolization together with sorafenib tosylate is more effective than chemoembolization alone in treating patients with liver cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Assessed 4 months after first chemoembolization, 8 months after first chemoembolization, then every 8 weeks, up to 4 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Sorafenib and TACE)","deltaMin":9.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Placebo and TACE)","deltaMin":8.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":30,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":281,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":110},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Platelet count decreased","Anemia","Nausea","Abdominal pain"]}}
