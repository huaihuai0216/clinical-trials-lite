Hormone therapy using exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole, may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Giving exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known whether exemestane, letrozole, or anastrozole is more effective in treating breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying exemestane, letrozole, and anastrozole to compare how well they work in treating postmenopausal women who are undergoing surgery for stage II or stage III breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical Response (Complete or Partial Response) Rate (Cohort A)","timeFrame":"Up to 18 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort A Arm I: Exemestane","deltaMin":62.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort A Arm II: Letrozole","deltaMin":74.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort A Arm III: Anastrozole","deltaMin":69.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21555689","28045625","34011995"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":157},"commonTop":["Hot flashes","Fatigue","Arthralgia","Anxiety","Myalgia"]}}
