This randomized, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate whether exenatide over a 5 week period in non-diabetic obese subjects may lead to weight loss. To control for variability in individual response to weight loss treatment, this study will assess the role of exenatide in changing food intake and energy expenditure as possible sources of weight loss. This study will also evaluate the safety profile of exenatide in non-diabetic obese people. Additional assessments will evaluate changes in body fat and hormones involved in the sensations of hunger and fullness.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Energy Intake","timeFrame":"Day 6-7-8 (at baseline) and Day 12-13-14 (3 days after starting study intervention)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Exenatide","deltaMin":1016.1,"sd":724.5},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":245.1,"sd":710.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":32},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17379054","15504997","17622601","32002540","30651576","29596853"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Headache","hunger decrease","Nausea","Diarrhea","Gastroesophageal reflux"]}}
