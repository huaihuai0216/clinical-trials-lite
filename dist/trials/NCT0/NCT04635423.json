It is hypothesized that administration of a 3-dose regimen of V503 reduces the combined incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related anogenital persistent infection, as well as the combined incidence of HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related anogenital persistent infection, compared with placebo.\n\nThe study includes a Base Study to assess efficacy and safety of V503, and an Extension Study. Participants who received placebo in the Base Study will be eligible to receive V503 vaccine on Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6 of the Extension Study. Participants who received less than 3 doses of V503 in the Base Study will be offered the opportunity to complete the 3-dose regimen in the Extension Study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Combined Incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 6/11/16/18-related Anogenital Persistent Infection","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 36 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V503","deltaMin":0.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":529},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Injection site swelling","Pyrexia"]}}
