Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare exenatide once weekly to once-daily liraglutide with regard to HbA1c, body weight, subject-reported outcomes, and other clinical benefits. The study includes a 26-week treatment period and a safety follow-up visit 10 weeks after the final study drug dose.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in HbA1c From Baseline to Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Exenatide Once Weekly","deltaMin":-1.28,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Liraglutide Once Daily","deltaMin":-1.48,"sd":0.05}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":108,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23748506","23141817"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":461},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Headache","Vomiting","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
