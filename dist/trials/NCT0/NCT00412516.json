The purpose of the JEV01 study was to help ensure the safety of SA 14-14-2 simultaneously administered with measles vaccine, paving the way for its use in routine EPI programs. As a follow-on to JEV01, this study will enroll those infants who received both vaccines and completed the JEV01 study. This study, however, will provide crucial data to help ensure the long-term immunogenicity of the concurrent administration of these vaccines and provide valuable information to determine the use of these vaccines in routine immunization programs. This study is planned because in the original protocol for JEV01, long-term data points were not included. The hypothesis is that children who receive JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine and measles vaccine at the same time have long-term (24 and 36 months post vaccination) protection against these diseases at the same level as those who receive the vaccines at different intervals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Measles Seropositivity at 24 and 36 Months","timeFrame":"24, 36 months post vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1","deltaMin":98.92,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2","deltaMin":95.75,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 3","deltaMin":94.37,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Philippines"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":93},"commonTop":[]}}
