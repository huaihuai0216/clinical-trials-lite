The trial population includes patients requiring valve replacements or repairs, atrial septal defect (ASD) repairs, patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. The study objectives are to demonstrate that the Medtronic Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System can safely and effectively treat permanent AF patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy Endpoint: The Percent of Patients Off Class I and/or III Antiarrhythmic Drugs and Out of Atrial Fibrillation as Determined by 24 Hour Holter Recording Conducted at 6 Months Postoperatively.","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cardioblate Surgical Ablation System","deltaMin":37.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.0041"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24184028"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":46,"n":75},"commonTop":["Pleural Effusion","Atelectasis","Renal Insufficiency/Failure: No Dialysis Required","Anemia","Congestive Heart Failure"]}}
