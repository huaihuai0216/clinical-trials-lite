The study is designed to test the hypothesis that pregnant women receiving a PI-based ART regimen will have lower risk of placental malaria compared to pregnant women receiving a non-PI based ART regimen. The primary study endpoint of the study is placental malaria. This study also enrolls the infants of these women at the time of delivery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Prevalence of Malaria Defined as Positive Placental Blood Smear","timeFrame":"Delivery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"With Protease Inhibitor","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Without Protease Inhibitor","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".76"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21876053","23796921","22879899","23924639","23764539","24038035","24135775","24585398","24958908","25072616","25426808","25416075","25985404","26397935","26771662","27143666","27828878","27756308","32440638","29136115"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":194},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Abdominal pain","Urine Protein","Fatigue/malaise","Anemia"]}}
