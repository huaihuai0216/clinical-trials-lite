Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving paclitaxel with trastuzumab and/or lapatinib before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. It is not yet known which regimen is more effective in treating patients with breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"pCR Rate","timeFrame":"At time of surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (THL)","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (TH)","deltaMin":46,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm III (TL)","deltaMin":32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.13"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.072"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":318,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40480221","33095682","26527775"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":115},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Diarrhea","Hemoglobin decreased","Rash desquamating"]}}
