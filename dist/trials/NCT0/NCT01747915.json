It is hypothesized that both doses of pregabalin will demonstrated superior efficacy when compared to placebo by reducing PGTC seizure frequency and that pregabalin will be safe and well tolerated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Log-transformed (Log) 28-day Seizure Rate for All Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic (PGTC) Seizures During 12-Week Double-Blind Treatment Phase","timeFrame":"Day 1 up to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pregabalin 5 mg/kg/Day or 7 mg/kg/Day or 300 mg/Day","deltaMin":1.17,"sd":0.097},{"arm":"Pregabalin 10 mg/kg/Day or 14 mg/kg/Day or 600 mg/Day","deltaMin":1.13,"sd":0.095},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.14,"sd":0.098}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.8121"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.8889"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":127,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belarus","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","China","Croatia","Denmark","France","Greece","Hungary","India","Lebanon","Malaysia","Montenegro","Philippines","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34033265"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A0081105&StudyName=A%20Safety%2C%20Efficacy%20and%20Tolerability%20Trial%20of%20Pregabalin%20as%20Add-On%20Treatment%20in%20Pediatric%20and%20Adult%20Subjects%20with%20Primary%20Generalized%20T"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":75},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Headache","Somnolence","Fatigue","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
