Participants will be randomized to receive either Mircera once every 4 weeks, at a starting dose of 1.2 micrograms/kilogram (mcg/kg), or darbepoetin alfa once weekly, at a starting dose of 0.45 mcg/kg (or once every two weeks, 0.75 mcg/kg). The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Hemoglobin (Hb) Response","timeFrame":"Baseline up to Week 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mircera","deltaMin":94.12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Darbepoetin Alfa","deltaMin":93.51,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":76,"countries":["Australia","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36791280"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":150},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Upper respiratory tract infection","Hyperkalaemia","Constipation","Diarrhoea"]}}
