To assess the efficacy of a lipid-lowering agent (atorvastatin) on the development of atherosclerosis that predisposes children with SLE to cardiovascular events in adulthood.\n2. To assess the safety of intermediate-term (36 months) treatment of children and young adults with atorvastatin.\n3. To further characterize the course of SLE in children and young adults, by establishing a cohort of pediatric SLE patients to be followed prospectively.\n4. To establish a mechanism for conducting clinical trials in rare pediatric rheumatic diseases using the Children's Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Mean-Mean Common Carotid IMT (CIMT)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline to 36 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1 Atorvastatin","deltaMin":0.001,"sd":null},{"arm":"2 Placebo","deltaMin":0.0024,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25902709","25396067","25396060","23436914","22031171","19404953"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":113},"commonTop":["Neurotoxicity","Rash","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Hypertension","Arthralgia"]}}
