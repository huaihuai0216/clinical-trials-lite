Patients who are not responding to their current loop diuretics will be considered for this study. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are recommended as standard of care in management of heart failure (HF) patients. However, recommended doses of MRAs (spironolactone 25mg/daily or eplerenone 50mg/daily) will not have any impact on signs and symptoms of volume overload. Therefore, the proposed study will aim to show the impact of this outpatient regimen to improve diuresis and possible reduction in hospitalization for further diuretic management in HF patients with signs and symptoms of congestion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight","timeFrame":"7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"High-dose","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":2},{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":1.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Hyperkalemia"]}}
