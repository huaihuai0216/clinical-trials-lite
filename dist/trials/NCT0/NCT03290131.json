Spasticity is a common complication in MS and occurs in up to 84% of patients. The main sign of spasticity is resistance to passive limb movement characterized by increased resistance to stretching, clonus, and exaggerated deep reflexes. Osmotica Pharmaceutical is currently developing arbaclofen extended-release tablets (AERT) for the treatment of spasticity in patients with MS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Total Numeric-transformed Modified Ashworth Scale Score of the Most Affected Limb (TNmAS-MAL)","timeFrame":"84 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AERT 40 mg","deltaMin":-1.7,"sd":1.97},{"arm":"AERT 80 mg","deltaMin":-2,"sd":1.78},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.4,"sd":1.82}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["Belarus","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Croatia","Moldova","Poland","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":179},"commonTop":["Urinary Tract Disorder","Muscular Weakness","Nausea","Asthenia","Dizziness"]}}
