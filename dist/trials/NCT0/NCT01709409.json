Curosurf is a medication that is already used in other countries around the world but not yet in Canada.\n\nBabies born under 32 weeks of gestation frequently need respiratory support after birth, including being placed on a breathing machine or respirator. The most common reason is Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) whereby immature lungs don't produce enough surfactant, a soapy like substance that helps the air sacs open and close. Our current standard treatment is a surfactant called BLES. Curosurf contains more active ingredient per volume therefore the amount is smaller. The investigators hypothesize that babies who receive Curosurf will be able to be removed from the ventilator sooner.\n\nBabies in this study will have a 50/50 chance of receiving either Curosurf or BLES and the investigators will monitor their progress during their Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission.\n\nThe study is taking place in Canada. The goal is to enroll 88 babies. There are no extra tests (blood tests or X-Rays) or return visits to the hospital for the purposes of this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Primary Objective of the Study is to Compare Between the Two Groups, the Number of Subjects Alive and Extubated at 48 Hours Post Surfactant Administration.
