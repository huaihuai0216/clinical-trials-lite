The secondary objective of this study is to provide information on recurrence of EGW. Additionally the study will also look at any adverse events associated with the use of the creams.\n\nExternal genital and perianal warts are caused by the infection of human papillomavirus or HPV. HPV infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). External genital warts look like small flesh-colored, pink, or red growths on or around the external skin of sex organs or perianal area. The warts may look similar to the small parts of a cauliflower or they may be very tiny and difficult to see. They often appear in clusters of three or four, and may grow and spread rapidly. They usually are not painful, although they may cause mild pain, bleeding, and itching.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Subjects With Complete Clearance of All Warts (Both Presented at Baseline and Newly Emerged Warts) at End of Study","timeFrame":"Up to 16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2.5% Imiquimod Cream","deltaMin":0.191,"sd":null},{"arm":"3.75% Imiquimod Cream","deltaMin":0.272,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.103,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":178},"commonTop":["Application site pain","Application site irritation"]}}
