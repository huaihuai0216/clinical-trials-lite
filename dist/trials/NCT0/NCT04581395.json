This medication can cause significant muscle soreness. Rocuronium is a medication (non-depolarizing muscle relaxant) that some anesthesia providers believe may reduce muscle soreness caused by succinylcholine if given prior, but this has been controversial. Some anesthesiologists pretreat patients with rocuronium before giving patients succinylcholine, and some do not. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of pretreatment with rocuronium on muscle soreness associated with succinylcholine administration.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Myalgias Perceived at 3 Hours","timeFrame":"3 hours post succinylcholine administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Not Pretreated With Rocuronium","deltaMin":81,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pre-treated With Rocuronium 1 Minute Before Succinylcholine Administration","deltaMin":83,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pre-treated With Rocuronium 2 Minutes Before Succinylcholine Administratjion","deltaMin":83,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16571955","10651675","2139549","9429043","9669004","16192781","20201179","25006369"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":100},"commonTop":[]}}
