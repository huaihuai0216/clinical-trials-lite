After several years of taking L dopa or dopamine agonists, patients notice that their PD medications wear off sooner than when they first started taking them. This \"wearing off\" is characterized by the return of symptoms (i.e., tremor, slowness, and rigidity) and may occur over the course of a few minutes to an hour. When a patient's PD symptoms have returned, the patient is said to be in the \"off\" state. When the patient takes another dose of medication, and his/her PD symptoms improve or resolve, the patient is said to be in the \"on\" state. Antagonism of adenosine Type 2a receptors (A2a) may provide relief of PD symptoms. This trial will test the hypothesis that A2a receptor antagonism can lead to improvement in the function of PD participants taking a stable dose of L-dopa, as measured by a reduction in \"off\" time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Mean \"Off\" Time","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Preladenant 2 mg","deltaMin":-0.9,"sd":0.21},{"arm":"Preladenant 5 mg","deltaMin":-0.9,"sd":0.21},{"arm":"Preladenant 10 mg","deltaMin":-0.8,"sd":0.21},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.8,"sd":0.21},{"arm":"Rasagiline 1 mg","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":0.21}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.8700"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26523919"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":154},"commonTop":["Dyskinesia","Headache","Constipation","Back pain","Tremor"]}}
