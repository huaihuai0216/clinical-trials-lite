The Pa infection rate in CF patients increases with age and by age 18 years approximately 85% of CF patients in the US are infected. Liposomal amikacin for inhalation (Arikayce™) was developed as a possible treatment for chronic infection due to Pa in CF patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine whether Arikayce™ is effective in treating chronic lung infections caused by Pa in CF participants. The effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of Arikayce™ will be compared to Tobramycin TOBI®, an inhalation antibiotic already available for use.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pulmonary Function Test: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"Baseline to168 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arikayce™","deltaMin":0.47,"sd":13.93},{"arm":"TOBI®","deltaMin":1.67,"sd":16.05}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":62,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Serbia","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31451351"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":148},"commonTop":["Infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis","Nasopharyngitis","Haemoptysis","General disorders","Cough"]}}
