A secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy of multiple doses of the combination in comparison to ibuprofen alone over a 5-day post-surgical period (study stage 2).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time-weighted Sum of Pain Relief (PAR) and Pain Intensity Difference (PID) From 0 to 8 Hours (SPRID0-8h)","timeFrame":"0 to 8 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":10.554,"sd":3.527},{"arm":"Caffeine","deltaMin":15.824,"sd":3.525},{"arm":"Ibuprofen","deltaMin":40.165,"sd":2.047},{"arm":"Ibuprofen/Caffeine","deltaMin":52.291,"sd":2.027}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32333328","28805281"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":70},"commonTop":["Nausea"]}}
