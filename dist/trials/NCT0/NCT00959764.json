Osteoporosis is the term used to describe a large group of diseases, which are characterized by loss of bone density, which makes the bones weaker. Osteoporosis often occurs in postmenopausal women.\n\nCalcitonin is a hormone found in the human body. Together with other substances, it regulates the concentration of calcium in the blood and inhibits the natural resorption of bone. Both medications in this study contain salmon calcitonin (sCT), because this form of calcitonin is more active than human calcitonin when used as a medicine.\n\nThe calcitonin Nasal Spray used in this study is registered and available to doctors in United States for the treatment of osteoporosis. The medication being tested in this study is an oral tablet form of salmon calcitonin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of Axial Lumbar Spine","timeFrame":"48 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Calcitonin","deltaMin":1.53,"sd":3.17},{"arm":"Nasal Calcitonin","deltaMin":0.76,"sd":2.91},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.47,"sd":3.21}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Hungary","Poland","South Africa","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22437792"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":263},"commonTop":["abdominal pain","abdominal pain upper","nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Headache"]}}
