Participants are first screened by a pediatric gastroenterologist and assessed and treated for any constipation or other potential medical complications. Following this, caregivers collect data on bowel movements and continence during a home baseline lasting no less than 14 days and no more than 21 days. Participants randomly assigned to treatment as usual or the treatment group, and begin attending daily appointments in clinic for 2 weeks. At appointments, the behavior team implements structured sits on the toilet to promote independent bowel movements (BMs). If an independent BM does not occur, the study team will administer a suppository to promote rapid release of the bowels and prompt the child to remain on the toilet following administration. In doing so, continent bowel movements are predictably evoked while the child is on the toilet, allowing for reinforcement with praise and preferred toys/activities. Eventually, suppositories are gradually decreased until the child is having BMs independently. Caregivers are trained to continue implementing the intervention following the clinic-based portion.\n\nThe purpose of the current study is to evaluate MIE using a large randomized clinical trial (RCT), addressing the Department of Defense Autism Research Program, Area of Interest of Therapies to Alleviate Conditions Co-Occurring with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The researchers will recruit 112 children diagnosed with ASD, randomizing them to two weeks of MIE, or treatment as usual (TAU) consisting of behavioral consultation and medical intervention. This study will evaluate MIE compared to TAU and determine the optimal treatment length.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Continent Bowel Movements","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Multidisciplinary Intervention for Encopresis (MIE) Treatment for One Week","deltaMin":27.33,"sd":29.72},{"arm":"Multidisciplinary Intervention for Encopresis (MIE) Treatment for Two Weeks","deltaMin":16.99,"sd":28.48},{"arm":"Treatment as Usual (TAU)","deltaMin":20.7,"sd":25.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":26},"commonTop":["Constipation","Rhinitis","Difficulty falling asleep","Diarrhea","Vomiting"]}}
