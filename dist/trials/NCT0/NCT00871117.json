Both Kinrix and the second dose of Varivax are indicated in children 4-6 years of age, and there is great potential for the vaccines to be given concurrently. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate that co-administered Varivax does not negatively affect the immunogenicity or reactogenicity of Kinrix.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Booster Responses to Diphteria and Tetanus","timeFrame":"One month after Kinrix vaccination (Month 1), prior to Varivax vaccination for Kinrix + M-M-R II -> Varivax Group.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Kinrix + M-M-R II + Varivax","deltaMin":209,"sd":null},{"arm":"Kinrix + M-M-R II -> Varivax","deltaMin":207,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22064267"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":239},"commonTop":["Pain","Redness","Swelling","Drowsiness","Fever"]}}
