The hypothesis is that etoricoxib (60 mg and 90 mg) administration will demonstrate superior efficacy compared to placebo after 6 weeks of treatment, as measured by the greater mean improvement from baseline in the Disease Activity Score C-Reactive Protein (DAS-28 CRP), and by the greater mean improvement in Patient Global Assessment of Pain (PGAP) from baseline over 6 weeks of treatment. Additionally, the added benefit of increasing the dose of etoricoxib from 60 mg to 90 mg will be assessed in the second part of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time-Weighted Average Change From Baseline in DAS28-CRP in Part 1 (Etoricoxib vs. Placebo)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Etoricoxib 60 mg","deltaMin":-1.39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Etoricoxib 90 mg","deltaMin":-1.37,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.004"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.034"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["27502582"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":819},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
