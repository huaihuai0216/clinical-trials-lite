All subjects must have a BRAF mutation-positive tumour sample. Subjects who have received up to one prior regimen of chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic melanoma setting will be enrolled into the study. Subjects with any prior BRAF or MEK inhibitor use will be excluded. Approximately 297 subjects will be enrolled with 2:1 randomization (198 subjects into the GSK1120212 arm and 99 subjects into the chemotherapy arm). The primary endpoint for the statistical analysis will be a comparison of progression free survival for subjects receiving GSK1120212 compared to chemotherapy. Subjects who have progression on chemotherapy will be offered the option to receive GSK1120212.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival in BRAF V600E Mutation-positive Participants Without a History of Brain Metastases as Assessed by the Investigator and Independent Review","timeFrame":"Day 1 until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause (average of 20.3 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trametinib","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","New Zealand","Norway","Poland","Russia","Sweden","Switzerland","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22663011","30690294","27172483","26446943","24504441"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":52,"n":211},"commonTop":["Rash","Diarrhea","Nausea","Fatigue","Oedema peripheral"]}}
