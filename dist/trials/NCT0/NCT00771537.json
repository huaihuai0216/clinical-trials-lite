Adult African-American, non-Latina White, and Latina women will be recruited. Women will initially be randomized to 4 groups: 1. no message control; 2. 1-sided message that mentions benefits of HIV testing; 3. 2-sided message that acknowledges minor opposition to testing, then refutes the opposition; and 4. 2-sided message that acknowledge stronger opposition to testing, then refutes the opposition. Women will be offered HIV testing, then re-randomized to a similar set of 4 messages related to HIV vaccine trials. There will therefore be 16 groups in total (4 X 4).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Accepted Rapid HIV Testing.","timeFrame":"During study visit.
