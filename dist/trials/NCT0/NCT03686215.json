Surgeons are blinded to whether a participant will be randomized into the device arm until after the standard of care lumpectomy is complete. Participants will then be randomized to receiving the device. Therapeutic (LUM guided) shaves will be removed based on the guidance of the LUM Imaging System. Patients will be followed until their first standard of care post-operative follow-up visit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Had Residual Cancer Found in at Least One LUM Imaging System Guided Shave Among All Patients.","timeFrame":"Day 1, during surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Device Intervention: LUM Imaging System Used","deltaMin":7.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38320161"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":357},"commonTop":["Chromaturia","Seroma","Breast pain","Nausea","Procedural pain"]}}
