To demonstrate the efficacy of enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid by providing complete eschar removal as compared with Gel vehicle,\n2. To demonstrate the efficacy of enzymatic eschar removal with NexoBrid by providing earlier complete eschar removal, reduction in patients' surgical burden and its related blood loss as compared to SOC,\n3. To assess the safety of NexoBrid compared to SOC, including demonstration that treatment with NexoBrid does not cause an unacceptable level of harm on wound closure outcome and long term outcomes of cosmesis and function.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary Endpoint: Number of Participants With Complete Eschar Removal.","timeFrame":"post application (post 2 h soaking)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NexoBrid Gel","deltaMin":70,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gel Vehicle","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Czechia","Georgia","Germany","Israel","Italy","Romania"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37715999"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":77},"commonTop":["Pruritis","Constipation","Joint Range of Motion Decreased","Pyrexia","Nausea"]}}
