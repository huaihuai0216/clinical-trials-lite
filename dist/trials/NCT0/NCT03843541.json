Patients will be randomized to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or ambroxol or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. A total of approximately 333 patients in China will be randomized. The total study duration will be approximately 8 months including the enrolment period of approximately 7 months and the patient participation duration of 1 month or 4 weeks. Each patient will undergo a screening period of up to 1 week, a 1-week treatment period and a 2-week follow-up period. This study will be conducted in approximately 15-25 sites in China.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Day 7 of Mean Sputum Viscosity Score of NAC and Placebo","timeFrame":"From baseline upto Day 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"N-Acetylcysteine","deltaMin":-1.2,"sd":0.74},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1,"sd":0.78}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":108},"commonTop":["Hypokalaemia","Nephrolithiasis","Renal cyst","Pneumonia","Hepatic cyst"]}}
