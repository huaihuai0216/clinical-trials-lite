The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of tanezumab 10 mg and 5 mg compared to placebo for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of tanezumab 10 mg and 5 mg compared to placebo for the treatment of chronic low back pain. In addition, the study will evaluate the effectiveness and long term safety profile of tanezumab treatment for chronic low back pain compared to tramadol Prolonged Release (PR), a medication commonly utilized for the treatment of chronic low back pain.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Average Low Back Pain Intensity (LBPI) Score for Tanezumab Versus (Vs) Placebo at Week 16","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.68,"sd":0.15},{"arm":"Pooled Tanezumab 5 mg","deltaMin":-2.98,"sd":0.14},{"arm":"Pooled Tanezumab 10 mg","deltaMin":-3.08,"sd":0.14},{"arm":"Tramadol","deltaMin":-2.81,"sd":0.12}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1117"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0281"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":262,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","France","Hungary","Japan","South Korea","Spain","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35962939","32453139"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A4091059"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":215},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Headache","Back pain","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
