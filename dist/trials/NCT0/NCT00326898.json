Sunitinib malate and sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sunitinib malate or sorafenib tosylate after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether sunitinib malate is more effective than sorafenib tosylate or placebo in treating kidney cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-free Survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"Assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry; every 6 months if patient is 2 - 5 years from study entry; then annually if patient is 5 - 10 years from study entry","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Sunitinib + Sorafenib Placebo)","deltaMin":5.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Sorafenib + Sunitinib Placebo)","deltaMin":6.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C (Sunitinib Placebo + Sorafenib Placebo)","deltaMin":6.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.80"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.72"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":987,"countries":["United States","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37433436","34480522","34405965","31703971","28945839","28278333","26969090"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":368,"n":625},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Hand-foot reaction","Diarrhea w/o prior colostomy","Hypertension","Rash/desquamation"]}}
