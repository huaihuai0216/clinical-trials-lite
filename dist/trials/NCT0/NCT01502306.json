This project has the following specific aims:\n\n1. To increase tobacco cessation among Medi-Cal beneficiaries who currently smoke, and to improve the management of diabetes and other chronic disease by means of tobacco cessation.\n2. Demonstrate that tobacco cessation benefits that are well promoted and barrier free and include modest incentives, are effective in reducing smoking prevalence, lowering Medi-Cal health care costs, and improving health outcomes for diabetes management in particular.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"30-day Abstinence","timeFrame":"7 months post enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Telephone Counseling","deltaMin":168,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phone Counseling & Nicotine Patches","deltaMin":237,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phone Counseling, NRT and Incentives","deltaMin":302,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["8907100","12362011","18048638","22094998","30454668"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1004},"commonTop":[]}}
