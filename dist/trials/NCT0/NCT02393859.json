Therapy is usually stratified according to risk characteristics to ensure that appropriate treatment is administered to patients with high-risk of relapse. In general, pediatric treatment regimens are more intense than those employed in adults and include courses of combination chemotherapy. Standard of care chemotherapy is associated with considerable toxicity. There is a lack of novel treatment options for subjects who relapse or are refractory to treatment. Therefore, innovative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Blinatumomab is a bispecific single-chain antibody construct designed to link B cells and T cells resulting in T cell activation and a cytotoxic T cell response against CD19 expressing cells. This study will evaluate the event-free survival (EFS) after treatment with blinatumomab when compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. The effect of blinatumomab on overall survival and reduction of minimal residual disease compared to SOC chemotherapy will also be investigated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kaplan Meier Estimate: Event-Free Survival (EFS; Primary Analysis)","timeFrame":"As of the primary analysis data cutoff date (17 July 2019), overall median follow-up time for EFS was 22.4 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HC3 Chemotherapy","deltaMin":7.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Blinatumomab","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"0 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":103,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35482538","33651091","37071263"],"seeAlso":["http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":52},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Stomatitis","Anaemia","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
