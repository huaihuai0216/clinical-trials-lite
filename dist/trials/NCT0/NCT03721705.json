Subjects will be prospectively randomized to treatment or sham (in a 1:1 ratio) using stratification for Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease or Mild Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type, and Cardiovascular Risk (CVR) score at multiple sites. Subjects, ages 55-85, will be consented for 13 months and will receive thirty-five 60-minute RenewTM NCP-5 treatment sessions during a 7-to-12-week initial treatment period, and then transition to a lower frequency maintenance period (twice a week) for a total treatment period of 24 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Vascular Dementia Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale (vADAS-cog) Using the Average of Scores at 12, 18 and 24 Weeks.","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Arm","deltaMin":-9.76,"sd":1.54},{"arm":"Sham Arm","deltaMin":-5.31,"sd":1.73}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States","Ireland","Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":98},"commonTop":["Skin Irritation/Injury","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Back Pain","Diarrhea","Gastrointestinal Upset"]}}
