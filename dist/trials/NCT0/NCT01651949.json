The overall goal is to bridge 9vHPV efficacy findings in young women to young men based on the demonstration of similar immunogenicity and safety profiles. The primary hypothesis is that 9vHPV induces antibody responses at 4 weeks postdose 3 in heterosexual males that are non-inferior to antibody responses in young women.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to the HPV Types Contained in the 9vHPV Vaccine","timeFrame":"Four weeks post vaccination 3 (Month 7)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Heterosexual Males","deltaMin":782,"sd":null},{"arm":"Females","deltaMin":703.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Men Who Have Sex With Men","deltaMin":568.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26144901","27422279"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":1394},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema","Headache"]}}
