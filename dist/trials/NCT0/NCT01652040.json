The proposed method could become a recommended and simple intervention especially for individuals with limited access and poor tolerance to exercise. The rationale is based on the evidence that individuals with SCI experience decline in anabolic hormones which may be responsible for the deterioration in body composition and metabolic profiles and leads to increase obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and subsequently cardiovascular disease. The designed study will provide explanation to the adaptations in the energy source of the muscle cells in response to training.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Body Composition","timeFrame":"16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RT+Tp","deltaMin":31.84,"sd":10.7},{"arm":"Testosteroe Replacement Patches (Tp)","deltaMin":33.4,"sd":9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28377392","28290190","28255089","28193782","27458592","25615403","21659900","20397451","23423356","23683374","28770686","29021917","29315167","29405604","29461936","29474998","29511310","29559683","28864949","28948164","34713983","33443609","32352341","30845047","30794084"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
