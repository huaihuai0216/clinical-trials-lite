The trial is focusing on patients with confirmed hereditary antithrombin deficiency who are undergoing a surgical procedure or induced/spontaneous labor and delivery. The study will test the safety and efficacy of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) by infusing rhAT prior to, during and following the period of risk or surgical procedure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Thromboembolic Events Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) and/or Thromboembolic Events Other Than Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).","timeFrame":"Baseline, last day of dosing and day 7 (+ or - 1 day)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Recombinant Human Antithombin (rhAT) Infusion","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Italy","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24335249"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":14},"commonTop":["Hypotension","Post-operative pain","Anemia","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
