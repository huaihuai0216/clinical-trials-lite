Patients will receive either an amount for this surgery based on weight, blood pressure, heart rate and urine output or an amount guided by a computerized system (FloTrac) that helps doctors know how much fluid each patient needs. The FloTrac calculates the amount of fluid patients needs on a minute-to-minute basis, based on real time information like blood pressure, pulse and the ability of the heart and blood vessels to maintain normal vital signs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postoperative Complications","timeFrame":"30 days post procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard Fluid Management","deltaMin":42,"sd":null},{"arm":"Goal Directed Fluid Therapy","deltaMin":45,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26206652"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mskcc.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":66},"commonTop":["Alanine aminotransferase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Hyperglycemia","Hypoalbuminemia","Intra-abdominal infection of abscess"]}}
