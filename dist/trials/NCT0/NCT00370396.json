Antibody persistence will be evaluated at 8-14 mo after completion of the 3-dose immunization course in study 105553 (NCT00307554). The immune response to a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will also be evaluated when given at 12-18 mo to subjects not primed with GSK Biologicals' vaccine but with Prevenar™.\n\nThe study has 3 groups. 1 group of children primed with GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will receive a booster dose of the same vaccine. 2nd group of children primed with Prevenar™ will receive a booster dose of Prevenar™ (control group). 3rd group of children primed with Prevenar™ will receive a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. All children will receive concomitantly a booster dose of DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib vaccine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Rectal Temperature Above (>) 39.0 Degrees Celsius (°C) Post Booster Between the Synflorix-Synflorix and Prevenar-Prevenar Groups","timeFrame":"Within 4 days (Days 0-3) after the booster vaccination at Month 0 in this study 10PN-PD-DIT-007","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Synflorix-Synflorix Group","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevenar-Prevenar Group","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["Finland","France","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19325450","19325447","19325452","26954689","19325449"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":737},"commonTop":["Irritability","Erythema","Pain","Swelling","Somnolence"]}}
