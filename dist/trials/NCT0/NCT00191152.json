The experimental arm will receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) over 30 minutes days 1 and 8 and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV day 1 over 1 hour repeated every three weeks. The comparator arm will receive docetaxel 75 mgm/m2 IV day 1 over 1 hour and oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily, days 1 through 14 repeated every three weeks. Patients who progress on the experimental arm, will be treated with capecitabine as dosed on the comparator arm. Patients who progress on the comparator arm will be treated with gemcitabine as dosed on the experimental arm.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Disease Progression (Initial Treatment)","timeFrame":"Randomization date to the earliest date of first documented disease progression date or the date of death if the participant died due to study disease (up to 82 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gemcitabine Plus Docetaxel","deltaMin":9.28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Docetaxel Plus Capecitabine","deltaMin":8.88,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.385"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":65,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Mexico","Puerto Rico","South Korea","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34037241"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":72,"n":237},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Fatigue","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Alopecia"]}}
