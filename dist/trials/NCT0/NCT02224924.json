The two techniques consist of either injecting a very small amount of your the blood called a blood patch into the biopsy hole or injecting a gel-based FDA approved artificial plug called BioSentry that will eventually get absorbed into the body.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"the Rate of Pneumothorax","timeFrame":"2 hours post procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Autologous Blood Patch Injection (ABPI)","deltaMin":42,"sd":null},{"arm":"BioSentry (Formerly Known as Bio-Seal) Hydrogel Tract Plug","deltaMin":60,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30480487"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mskcc.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":226},"commonTop":[]}}
