Untreated depression can lead to reduced productivity and poor global outcome. There is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of TBI-related depression. The overarching goal of this small study is to determine the effectiveness of low frequency right (LFR) rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain stimulation technique. It involves generating a brief magnetic field in a coil that is placed on the scalp. The magnetic field passes through the skull and induces a weak electrical current in the brain that briefly activates neural circuits at the stimulation site. Adults aged 18 and older, with a history of head injury of mild or moderate severity , who are currently experiencing symptoms of clinical depression may join the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Depression Score Using the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) 17 Scale","timeFrame":"Mean at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LFR rTMS","deltaMin":23.154,"sd":4.375},{"arm":"Sham Treatment","deltaMin":23.076,"sd":4.356}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Headache","Other","Depression","Anxiety","Dizziness"]}}
