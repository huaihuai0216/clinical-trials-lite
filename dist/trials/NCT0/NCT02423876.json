An epidural analgesia (pain relief) is a small tube placed in the lower back that numbs the nerves and stops the feeling of pain. It stays in place for several days after surgery and may be helpful for pain control in patients with gynecologic cancer after surgery. ERP is a set of specific steps used before, during, and after surgery by health care providers to care for patients after surgery. ERPs include patient education, not using laxatives before surgery, increasing activity after surgery, and scheduled use of medications for pain and nausea. Giving epidural anesthesia as part of an ERP may improve pain control in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Relative Pain Scores, as Measured by the Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)","timeFrame":"Up to 24 hours post-surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Epidural Placement, ERP)","deltaMin":3.87,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (ERP)","deltaMin":4.95,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://cancer.wisc.edu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":52},"commonTop":["anemia","vascular thrombolic event"]}}
