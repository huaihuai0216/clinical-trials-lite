Volunteers for this trial will be required to make 5 visits over up to 14 weeks to a participating expert physician practitioner for various sleep and narcolepsy evaluations and diaries will also be collected. Participants will take assigned medications during the course of the trial. Subjects will have a 25% probability of receiving placebo for both drugs (modafinil and Xyrem). All subject volunteers must meet criteria for narcolepsy and have evidence of daytime sleepiness. Patients will not incur any personal medical expenses due to participation in this trial. The sponsor is covering all visit costs not covered by insurance and there are some funds for patient expenses such as travel.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Daytime Sleep Latency as Measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT)","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Xyrem Placebo + Modafinil Placebo","deltaMin":-2.72,"sd":4.535},{"arm":"Xyrem + Modafinil Placebo","deltaMin":0.58,"sd":5.675},{"arm":"Xyrem Placebo + Modafinil at Established Dose","deltaMin":-0.53,"sd":4.358},{"arm":"Xyrem + Modafinil at Established Dose","deltaMin":2.68,"sd":5.071}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":40,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11833860","2281247","8506453","12627729","16895262","21206549","32356515","29221779"],"seeAlso":["http://www.xyrem.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":56},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Dizziness","Vomiting","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
