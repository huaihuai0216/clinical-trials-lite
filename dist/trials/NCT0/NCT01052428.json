Patients without coronary artery disease and moderate MR, as assessed by color/flow Doppler echocardiography, will be randomized to ß1-RB vs. placebo to address the following aims:\n\n\\*Aim 1: Establish whether ß1-RB attenuates adverse LV remodeling compared to placebo in patients with non-surgical, chronic MR. Using 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tissue tagging, LV function and geometry will be assessed at baseline and every 6 months for up to 2 years.\n\nAim 2: Determine whether indices of inflammation correlate with degree of LV remodeling and whether ß1-RB decrease indices of inflammation and collagen turnover. At the time of MRI, blood samples for collagen breakdown products, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, and markers of excess production of reactive inflammatory species (RIS) will be obtained and related to changes in LV remodeling defined by serial 3-dimensional MRI and tissue tagging.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Left Ventricular End Diastolic Volume Indexed to Body Surface Area","timeFrame":"5 visits per Participant over 2 years (about every 6 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":91.66,"sd":16.48},{"arm":"Toprol XL","deltaMin":95.74,"sd":19.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4568"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["3796056","12482807","1734647","8184862","8012639","9179087","9295005","9678300","11230841","11955859","12676546","11955858","9277516","12103269","12847066","7911128","12796766","11090790","12591752","10338457","1357162","10421593","12644008","10908093","12034658","10758057","11457746","10995421","9593557","12860861","11742938","12766756","11751725","12045381","12105163","22818065"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":19},"commonTop":["Anemia","abdominal pain","anxiety","colon polyp removed","headaches"]}}
