Vonapanitase is a protein that has been shown in previous research studies to help keep vessels patent when applied to the outside surface of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) in patients who undergo surgery to create an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The purpose of this study is to determine whether vonapanitase when applied to a limited segment of your blood vessel (about 2 inches) immediately after surgery is safe and improves the patency of your AVF.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Secondary AVF Patency","timeFrame":"Median time from AVF creation to AVF abandonment (secondary patency), assessed up to 1 year.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vonapanitase","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.932"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":41,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38825327","36567000","33482699"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":48,"n":399},"commonTop":["Vascular Stenosis","Arteriovenous Fistula Thrombosis","Haematoma","Local Swelling"]}}
