This study is designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to the Abacavir (ABC) 600 milligrams (mg)/Dolutegravir(DTG) 50 mg/Lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) compared with continuing the subject's current suppressive regimen through 24 weeks. The study will be conducted in approximately 538 Human Immunodeficiency Virus -1 (HIV-1) infected individuals who are on stable suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with 2 Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus either a protease inhibitor (PI), an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or an integrase inhibitor (INI). Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their current regimen (approximately 269 subjects) or be switched to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC (approximately 269 subjects) once daily for 24 weeks. At Week 24, individuals originally randomly assigned to continue their current regimen will switch to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC and be followed for an additional 24 weeks. Individuals initially randomly assigned to ABC/DTG/3TC FDC will continue on that treatment arm for an additional 24 weeks. A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy will be conducted at a small number of sites (approximately 10) to evaluate predose DTG concentrations as well as residual drug concentrations of efavirenz (EFV), nevaripine (NVP), amprenavir (APV) and tipranavir (TPV) in a subgroup of subjects who switch from EFV, NVP, fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) or tipranavir/ritonavir (TPV/r).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 24 Using the Snapshot Algorithm","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ABC 600 mg / DTG 50 mg /3TC 300 mg FDC","deltaMin":233,"sd":null},{"arm":"Current ART","deltaMin":245,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":103,"countries":["United States","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28401876"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":275},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Fatigue","Headache"]}}
