The overall intent of the current study is to more fully explore the impact of mepolizumab on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and other measures of asthma control, including lung function.\n\nParticipants who meet the predefined criteria will be randomised to receive either mepolizumab or placebo in addition to standard of care asthma treatment. Approximately 780 participants with severe eosinophilic asthma will be screened to ensure the randomisation of 544 participants (272 participants per treatment group) into the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Score at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-7.9,"sd":1.01},{"arm":"Mepolizumab 100 mg","deltaMin":-15.6,"sd":1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":144,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Netherlands","Norway","Peru","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34158028","34098955","31507641","31251094","31047111","29949045","28395936"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":278},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Back pain","Arthralgia"]}}
