The aim of the study is to compare the effect of semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c., under the skin) 1.0 mg once-weekly to liraglutide s.c.1.2 mg once-daily on blood sugar levels after 30 weeks of treatment in people with type 2 diabetes. The study will last approximately 9 months (37 weeks). Each participant will have 7 visits at the clinic and 3 phone calls with the study doctor.
