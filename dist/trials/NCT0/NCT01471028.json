Progression is defined as death or the first observed increase of at least 5 points from End of Study Day 1 MELD score (for both the ELAD and Control groups) until at least 24 hours after the ELAD Treatment Period is ended (end of Day 7 for Controls) and up to both End of Study Days 28 and 91 following Randomization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Up to at least Study Day 91, with protocol VTI-208E providing additional survival data (at 6, 9, 12, 24 months) at the time of database lock (31 July 2015)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ELAD Treatment","deltaMin":57,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care (Control)","deltaMin":66,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.904"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":45,"countries":["United States","Australia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29171941"],"seeAlso":["http://www.vitaltherapies.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":73,"n":95},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Hepatic encephalopathy","Ascites","Anaemia","Hypokalaemia"]}}
