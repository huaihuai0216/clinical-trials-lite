A common treatment is the use of anti-clotting medications to prevent blood clots from forming in the narrowed vessel. There are a variety of medicines used for this purpose. These medications are usually taken for the rest of a patient's life.\n\nHowever, a treatment that has been used successfully together with anti-clotting medications in patients with narrowing of the blood vessels of the heart is now being studied in the blood vessels of the brain. This treatment is called stenting.\n\nRecent research has also indicated a benefit in prevention of recurring stroke by Intensive Medical Therapy, which is defined as treating risk factors for stroke like high blood pressure, elevated LDL (low density lipids - the \"bad\" form of cholesterol) and diabetes. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of either Intensive Medical Therapy PLUS Stenting or Intensive Medical Therapy ONLY in preventing stroke, heart attacks or death.\n\nThe study will enroll patients over a 5 year period. Each participant will be involved in the study for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years.\n\nFifty different medical centers in the United States are part of this study. Both the Clinical Coordinating Center and the Statistical Coordinating Center for the entire study will be located at Emory University.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Any Stroke or Death Within 30 Days of Enrollment or Any Revascularization Procedure OR an Ischemic Stroke in the Territory of the Symptomatic Intracranial Artery Beyond 30 Days After Enrollment.","timeFrame":"Mean length of follow-up was 2.4 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensive Medical Management Plus Stenting","deltaMin":52,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intensive Medical Management Alone","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0252"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22977278","22991350","22984008","21899409","24168957","40446174","39147573","31484697","30580705","28455321","28003500","26747792","26618534","26382173","26251251","25593135"],"seeAlso":["http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/alerts/intracranial_arterial_stenosis.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":146,"n":224},"commonTop":["Cardiac General","Transient Ischemic Attack / Cerebral Infarct with Temporary Signs","Systemic Hemorrhage","Neurology","Metabolic / Laboratory"]}}
