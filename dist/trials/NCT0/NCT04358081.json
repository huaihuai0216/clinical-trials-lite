Hydroxychloroquine treatment may inhibit viral nucleic acid-mediated activation of various innate immune pathways, as well as blockade of lysosomal functions in cell types relevant for viral entry and antigen presentation.\n\nThe purpose of the study was to determine if oral hydroxychloroquine monotherapy, or in combination with azithromycin results in clinical benefit in patients hospitalized with COVID19 pneumonia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Response by Day 15","timeFrame":"15 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Hydroxychloroquine + Aithromycin Placebo","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 3: Hydroxychloroquine Placebo + Azithromycin Placebo","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/patientsummary/patientsummaries?patientSummaryId=859"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":7},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Fatigue","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Cough"]}}
