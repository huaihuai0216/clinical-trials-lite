The duration for a participant in the study may range from 2 days to 4-6 weeks. One to four visits to the study doctor will be required.\n\nThis study will investigate the diagnostic results of gadobutrol-enhanced Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) images regarding the detection (sensitivity) and exclusion (specificity) of coronary artery disease utilizing a uniform image acquisition software. The CMR images will be tested either against the results from routine clinical Coronary Angiography (CA) or those from Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), which is used as the standard of reference. The CA/CTA may have been performed up to 4 weeks prior to enrollment or be scheduled up to 4/6 weeks after the study.\n\nCMRI and CA/CTA images will be collected for an independent image review (blinded read).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Presence of a Myocardial Perfusion Defect Indicating Significant CAD Per Participant on Gadobutrol-enhanced CMRI (Based on RPS) - Primary Analysis of Sensitivity Based on Blinded Readers' Assessment","timeFrame":"0 to 30/40 minute (min) post-injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg Body Weight","deltaMin":76.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","New Zealand","South Korea","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":426},"commonTop":["Chest discomfort","Headache","Angina pectoris","Feeling hot","Dyspnoea"]}}
