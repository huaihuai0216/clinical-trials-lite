If this program motivates these individuals to increase prosocial and healthy behaviors and decrease drug/alcohol use, established prevention programs may modify their approaches to include contingency management, and use it to address the staggering public health problems homeless substance-abusing MSMs face on a daily basis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Amount ($) Earned for Targeted Prosocial and Healthy Behaviors","timeFrame":"24 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Contingency Management","deltaMin":16.21,"sd":11.85}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20667681","22880545","21128876","27516073"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":67},"commonTop":[]}}
