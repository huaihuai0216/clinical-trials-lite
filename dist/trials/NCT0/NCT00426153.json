A total of 42 patients will be recruited -14 who will receive placebo and 28 the study drug. Preliminary evidence indicates that this drug is safe and non-toxic in other disease states. Treatment with this drug holds promise not only for individuals with liver involvement, but also for many more patients with polycystic kidney disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Liver Volume","timeFrame":"Baseline, 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Octreotide","deltaMin":-5,"sd":6.77},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.9,"sd":8.33}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.048"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22773240","39356039","26166166"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":28},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Diarrhea, Grade 1","abdominal cramping, bloating and gas","Injection site granuloma","Alopecia, moderate"]}}
