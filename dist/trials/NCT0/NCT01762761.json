This study was be conducted in Chinese adult chronic ITP subjects who had not responded to or had relapsed after previous treatment of ITP, including first line therapy and /or splenectomy.\n\nThe primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients compared to placebo. The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when administered for 6 weeks to previously treated adult chronic ITP patients compared with placebo. In addition, the long-term efficacy and safety of eltrombopag treatment was also evaluated in the 24-week extension open-label phase after the double-blind phase as one of other study objectives. If the subject benefited from the eltrombopag treatment based on the investigator's discretion, the subject could continue on eltrombopag treatment until the commercial launch of eltrombopag in China. Furthermore, to understand the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of eltrombopag and to explore the relationship between the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) (platelet response), a PK/PD analysis was embedded in this phase III study and conducted in the same patient population who participated this phase III study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants (Responders) Achieving a Platelet Count >=50Ã—10^9/L After the First 6 Weeks of Stage 1","timeFrame":"From the start of study treatment (Day 1) up to the end of Week 6 of Stage 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Eltrombopag","deltaMin":60,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":18,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33251910"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":51},"commonTop":["UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","NASOPHARYNGITIS","ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE INCREASED","ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE INCREASED","HYPOKALAEMIA"]}}
