The third patient will receive 1 to 2 small needle pricks at the location where the LP and IT injection is normally made (sham control).\n\nIn Part C, all participants will receive study drug, as described in the Part C registration record.\n\nStart date for this record is the first day a participant was enrolled in Parts A/B. The trial is actually continuing until the last primary outcome measure of safety data are collected from Part C participants. The last primary outcome measure of safety, along with final adverse events results will be posted in the separate Part C registration record.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Parts A/B: Change From Baseline to Week 52 in 4-Item Composite Score of Niemann Pick Type C Severity Scale (NPC-SS) Score","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sham Control","deltaMin":8.1,"sd":4.27},{"arm":"Adrabetadex","deltaMin":8.8,"sd":3.12}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Australia","France","Germany","New Zealand","Singapore","Spain","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40525490"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":3},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Fatigue","Back Pain","Hearing Impaired","Gait Disturbance"]}}
