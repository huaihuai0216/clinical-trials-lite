Efficacy was assessed by the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks after the discontinuation of therapy (SVR12). This was a non-inferiority study, and if non-inferiority was demonstrated, the study was then allowed to test for superiority.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks After Stopping All Study Drugs (SVR12)","timeFrame":"Post-treatment Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sofosbuvir+RBV","deltaMin":67,"sd":null},{"arm":"PEG+RBV","deltaMin":67,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":97,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Italy","Netherlands","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25040192","23607594"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":256},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Headache","Nausea","Insomnia","Rash"]}}
