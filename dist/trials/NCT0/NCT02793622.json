HIV uninfected women at 12-20 weeks gestation will be randomized in equal proportions to one of two intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) treatment arms: 1) monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), or 2) monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Both interventions arms will have either SP or DP placebo to ensure adequate blinding is achieved in the study. Follow-up for the pregnant women will end approximately 6 weeks after giving birth. All children born to mothers enrolled in the study will be followed from birth until they reach 12 months of age.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Deliver With a Composite Adverse Birth Outcome","timeFrame":"Delivery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Monthly Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) During Pregnancy","deltaMin":60,"sd":null},{"arm":"Monthly Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (DP) During Pregnancy","deltaMin":54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30910321","30019470","30891605","31014336","32772921","29547881","32249917","32562650","35876164","34864925","33738485","33272281"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":375},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain","Cough","Headache","Pyuria","Diarrhea"]}}
