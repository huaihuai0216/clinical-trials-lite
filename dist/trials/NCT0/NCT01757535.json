The EP allows participants who are currently receiving oral azacitidine and who are demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, to continue receiving oral azacitidine after unblinding by sponsor until the participant meets the criteria for study discontinuation or until oral azacitidine becomes commercially available and reimbursed. In addition, all participants in the placebo arm and participants who had been discontinued from the treatment phase (irrespective of randomization arm) and continuing in the follow-up phase will be followed for survival in the EP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kaplan-Meier (K-M) Estimate for Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Day 1 (randomization) up to data cut off date of 15 July 2019; median follow-up for OS estimated by the reverse K-M method was 41.2 months for all participants.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Azacitidine Plus Best Supportive Care","deltaMin":24.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care","deltaMin":14.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0009"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":223,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Lithuania","Mexico","Poland","Portugal","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26785287","37952982","36951156","35960871","35437111","34995344","34454540","33369355"],"seeAlso":["https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/clinical-trials-and-research.html","https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/default.htm","https://www.bmsstudyconnect.com/s/US/English/USenHome"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":110,"n":236},"commonTop":["Acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Neutropenia","Vomiting"]}}
