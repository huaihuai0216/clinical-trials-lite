The enrolled infants and children will be followed at pre-specified intervals until they reach 24 months chronological age. This study does not require medical interventions or study visits to an investigational site, instead, parents or legal guardians will be prompted at certain time points to complete developmental questionnaires and other data on their children's health status via an electronic device. Data collected during the infant and child follow up study will be managed by a centralized research coordinating center (RCC). Regionally based pediatricians will serve as study principal investigators (referred to as RCC-PIs) for this study. All communications the RCC-PI has with the parent/legal guardian or the child's health care provider (HCP) will occur remotely; there will be no clinic visits.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Infants and Children With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Medical Conditions (After 28 Days Post Estimated Date of Delivery)","timeFrame":"From 28 days post estimated date of delivery up to 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo (200719 Study)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Atosiban (200721 Study)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Retosiban (200719 and 200721 Study)","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Weeks","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Germany","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34352924"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":[]}}
