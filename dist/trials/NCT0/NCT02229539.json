A number of mouth rinse preparations exist for patients with treatment-related oral mucositis pain such as the DLA rinse, an over-the-counter medication. This study will evaluate the effects of doxepin compared to DLA (diphenhydramine, lidocaine and antacids) and placebo.Doxepin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of depression, anxiety, long-term pain management, as well as management of rash.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Total Pain Reduction","timeFrame":"Baseline, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes post treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Doxepin","deltaMin":11.6,"sd":9.7},{"arm":"DLA (Diphenhydramine, Lidocaine and Antacid)","deltaMin":11.7,"sd":8.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":8.7,"sd":9.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.02"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":350,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30990550"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":78},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Oral dysesthesia","Dry mouth","Oral pain","Paresthesia"]}}
