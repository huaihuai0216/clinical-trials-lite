Combination of pan-DAC and protease inhibition by co-treatment with panobinostat (PAN) and bortezomib (BTZ) has demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical experiments. Furthermore, clinical experience in advanced multiple myeloma (MM) patients treated by oral panobinostat and i.v bortezomib ± dexamethasone showed very encouraging results for efficacy and manageable toxicity profile.\n\nGiven the medical need for improved treatment strategies for patients with previously treated and relapsed MM, the purpose of this prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group Phase III study is to compare the results in progression-free survival of 2 combination therapies, panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone or placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone, in patients with previously treated MM whose disease has recurred or progressed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival Events in Patients Treated With Panobinostat in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone vs. Patients Treated by Placebo in Combination With Bortezomib and Dexamethasone.","timeFrame":"45 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Panobinostat + Bortezomib","deltaMin":207,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Bortezomib","deltaMin":260,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":210,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Czechia","Denmark","Egypt","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Israel","Italy","Japan","Lebanon","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27751707","27677481","26631116","25242045"],"seeAlso":["http://NovartisClinicalTrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":228,"n":381},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Thrombocytopenia","Anaemia","Fatigue","Neuropathy peripheral"]}}
