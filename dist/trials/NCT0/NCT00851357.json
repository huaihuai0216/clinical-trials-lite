Specifically, this study aims to:\n\n1. Test if sending active nicotine patches directly will lead to a higher quit rate, compared to a condition where the quitline assists the smokers to obtain patches by other means (e.g. via their health plans).\n2. Test if sending placebo patches directly will also lead to a higher quit rate.\n3. Test if quitline counseling increases the quit rate when the smokers already receive the nicotine patches.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Six-month Continuous Abstinence From Cigarettes","timeFrame":"7 months post enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":70,"sd":null},{"arm":"Patch (Placebo)","deltaMin":101,"sd":null},{"arm":"Patch (Real)","deltaMin":190,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1200},"commonTop":[]}}
