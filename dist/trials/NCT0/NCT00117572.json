Induction chemotherapy given before receiving local treatment has been shown to reduce the rate of distant failure. Many drugs have been found to prevent tumor cells from growing or dividing, although it has yet to be determined which agent, or specific combination of agents, is most effective in treating head and neck cancer. Docetaxel is a drug which has been reported to show promising activity in Phase II head and neck cancer studies. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy versus the same chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival: Time From Randomization to Death From Any Cause","timeFrame":"Up to 6 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Induction Plus Chemoradiotherapy","deltaMin":74.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemoradiotherapy","deltaMin":72.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.68"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Croatia","France","Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":138},"commonTop":["Hemoglobin","Hyperglycemia","Mucositis oral","Fatigue","Dermatitis radiation"]}}
