Caffeine, which is generally consumed as coffee, tea, or cocoa, has been shown to enhance the effect of various painkillers, and therefore is accepted as an additive.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well a fixed-dose combination of naproxen sodium and caffeine relieves pain compared to each single ingredient as well as to placebo in participants after molar removal.\n\nA placebo is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it.\n\nTo answer this, the researchers will compare the amount of pain decrease over 8 hours in participants who received a single dose of either:\n\n* 1 fixed-dose tablet of naproxen sodium/caffeine\n* 2 fixed-dose tablets of naproxen sodium/caffeine\n* naproxen sodium only\n* caffeine only\n* or placebo The study participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of the five treatment groups. They will take a single dose of two tablets by mouth within 4.5 hours after the surgery. If there is no pain relief within 2 hours after intake, other painkillers may be given.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over 8 Hours Post-dose","timeFrame":"Up to 8 hours post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Naproxen Sodium/ Caffeine 220/65 mg","deltaMin":31.293,"sd":1.441},{"arm":"Naproxen Sodium/Caffeine 2x220/65 mg","deltaMin":37.242,"sd":1.436},{"arm":"Naproxen Sodium 220 mg","deltaMin":31.082,"sd":1.443},{"arm":"Caffeine 100 mg","deltaMin":5.146,"sd":2.47},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":8.622,"sd":2.521}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.004"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"= 0.003"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":"= 0.325"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"= 0.918"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG004","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG004","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":147},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Nausea","Headache","Vomiting","Alveolar osteitis"]}}
