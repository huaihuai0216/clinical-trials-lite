In the first part, the efficacy and safety MK-0954E (losartan potassium 50 mg \\[L50\\] (+) hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg \\[H12.5\\] (+) amlodipine besylate 5mg \\[A5\\]) will be evaluated and compared to the efficacy and safety of MK-0954H (L50/H12.5) in Japanese participants. In the second part, the safety and tolerability of long-term use of open-label MK-0954E in participants with hypertension will be evaluated. The primary hypothesis is that MK-0954E is more effective in lowering mean trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment compared to MK-954H (L50/H12.5 mg) in Japanese participants with essential hypertension who are not adequately controlled following a 8-week treatment with filter period study drug of MK-954H.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Trough Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (SiDBP)-Double-Blind Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"L50/H12.5/A5","deltaMin":-12.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"L50/H12.5","deltaMin":-6.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25271811"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":145},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Blood uric acid increased","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Back pain"]}}
