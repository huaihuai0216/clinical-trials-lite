Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known if combination chemotherapy with vinblastine is more effective than combination chemotherapy with vincristine in treating advanced anaplastic large cell lymphoma.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination chemotherapy regimens with either vinblastine or vincristine in treating patients who have newly diagnosed advanced anaplastic large cell lymphoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"From first enrollment up to 3 years.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard (APO) With Vincristine (Arm I)","deltaMin":74,"sd":null},{"arm":"Consolidation (Includes Vinblastine) (Arm II)","deltaMin":79,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":159,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25156886"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":64},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Anemia","\"Infections and infestations - Other\""]}}
