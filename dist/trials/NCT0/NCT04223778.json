The primary hypothesis is that a switch to MK-8591A will be non-inferior to continued treatment with baseline antiretroviral therapy (ART) as assessed by the percentage of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) ≥50 copies/mL at Week 48.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) ≥50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1: Doravirine/Islatravir (DOR/ISL)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2: Baseline Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)","deltaMin":1.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Chile","Colombia","France","Italy","Japan","New Zealand","Poland","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38734015"],"seeAlso":["http://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":336},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Lymphocyte count decreased","CD4 lymphocytes decreased","Headache","Accidental overdose"]}}
