Based on this model, the investigators have developed a relapse prevention treatment to intervene on five areas important in relapse prevention, including fluctuating motivation, depression, withdrawal, weight gain, and social support. This treatment protocol has produced high long-term abstinence rates when implemented in a clinical research setting. The current study will evaluate the treatment model when implemented in a medical outpatient setting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Reported 7-day Point Prevalence Abstinence at Week 12","timeFrame":"12 weeks following treatment initiation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Extended Brief Contact","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Extended Health Education","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Extended Relapse Prevention Plus Varenicline","deltaMin":29,"sd":null},{"arm":"Extended Relapse Prevention","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37142273"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":55},"commonTop":[]}}
