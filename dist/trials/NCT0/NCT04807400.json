Inclisiran works in a way that makes the liver produce less of a substance called 'PCSK9'. PCSK9 reduces the ability of the liver to remove LDL-cholesterol from the blood. By lowering the production of PCSK9, Inclisiran leads to more LDL-cholesterol being removed by the liver from the blood, thereby reducing LDL-cholesterol overall.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change in LDL-C From Baseline to Day 270","timeFrame":"Baseline, Day 270","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Inclisiran","deltaMin":-37.3,"sd":2.29},{"arm":"Inclisiran + BS","deltaMin":-37.6,"sd":2.33},{"arm":"Control+ BS","deltaMin":-5.4,"sd":2.34}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40010816","39053958"],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/patientsummary/patientsummaries?patientSummaryId=2082"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":273},"commonTop":["Injection site rash","Back pain","Muscle spasms","Pain in extremity","Dizziness"]}}
