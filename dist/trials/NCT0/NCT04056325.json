The phase 2a trial is single blinded and conducted in Lao, while the phase 2b trial is double-blinded and conducted in Lao and Cambodia. The study aims at providing evidence on effective doses and safety of moxidectin in adults against infection with S. stercoralis in Laos (trial 2a) and efficacy and safety of moxidectin compared to ivermectin in adults against infection with S. stercoralis in Laos and Cambodia (trial 2b). The efficacy of the treatment will be assessed by collecting three stool samples once pre-treatment and once 21 days post-treatment. The stool samples will be analyzed by a quantitative Baermann assay.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Observed Cure Rate Against Strongyloides Stercoralis","timeFrame":"Phase 2a: 21-28 days after treatment; phase 2b: 14-21 days after treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm A (Moxidectin 2 mg)","deltaMin":73.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm B (Moxidectin 4 mg)","deltaMin":89.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm C (Moxidectin 6 mg)","deltaMin":84.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm D (Moxidectin 8 mg)","deltaMin":82.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm E (Moxidectin 10 mg)","deltaMin":96.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm F (Moxidectin 12 mg)","deltaMin":87.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2a - Arm G (Placebo)","deltaMin":13.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2b - Arm A (Moxidectin)","deltaMin":92.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 2b - Arm B (Ivermectin)","deltaMin":92.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Laos"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37949090","34296417","33798487"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":31},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain","Headache","Itching","Vomiting","Diarrhea"]}}
