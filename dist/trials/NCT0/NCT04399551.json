This interventional study will examine different implementation strategies in different clinic settings across European countries to identify strategies which best meet the needs in each local context and involve both participants receiving study treatment CAB LA + RPV LA (patient study participants \\[PSP\\]) as well as the healthcare providers at the investigator site level (staff study participants \\[SSP\\]).
