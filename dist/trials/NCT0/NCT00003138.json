It is not yet known whether erythropoietin with or without filgrastim is more effective than standard blood transfusions in reducing the need for transfusions in patients who have anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of erythropoietin with or without filgrastim with that of standard blood transfusions in reducing the need for transfusions in patients who have anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndrome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients Free of Transfusion at 4 Months","timeFrame":"Assessed at 4 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Supportive Care","deltaMin":0.459,"sd":null},{"arm":"Erythropoietin","deltaMin":0.714,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12921944","19564636"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":56},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Diarrhea","Nausea","Neuropathy-clinical","Skin"]}}
