The study takes place in 2 parts: a 7-day inpatient double-blind treatment portion where subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three doses of study medication (2.4 mg total daily dose of lofexidine, 3.2 mg total daily dose of lofexidine, or placebo) followed by an optional open-label treatment period where subjects will be inpatient or outpatient and receive lofexidine at variable dosing for up to an additional 7 days. The Investigator hypothesizes that subjects will achieve maximum treatment effect with tolerable side effects at the 3.2 mg total daily dose and that both the 3.2 mg and 2.4 total daily doses will show better efficacy over placebo in treating symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Difference Between the Overall Means From Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) Scores","timeFrame":"Days 1 through 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DB: Lofexidine HCl 2.4mg Dose","deltaMin":7.8,"sd":6},{"arm":"DB: Lofexidine HCl 3.2mg Dose","deltaMin":7.6,"sd":6.75},{"arm":"DB: Placebo","deltaMin":9.4,"sd":6.81}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0166"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0033"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":18,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32002194","31606589","30531234"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":229},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Orthostatic hypotension","Hypotension","Diarrhoea","Bradycardia"]}}
