Patients received either secukinumab, placebo. The core study was completed. However, the extension study was terminated early (unrelated to safety) due to the results of study AIN457F2309, which indicated the efficacy of AIN457 was not comparable to the currently available RA treatment, abatacept, thus leading to closing of the AIN457 RA program.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Core Study: Percentage of Participants Achieving an American College of Rheumatology Response 20 (ACR20) at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AIN457 10mg/Kg-75mg","deltaMin":35.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"AIN457 10mg/Kg-150mg","deltaMin":35.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":19.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0004"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":142,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Canada","Colombia","Guatemala","Hungary","India","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Panama","Puerto Rico","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31087226","29138986"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":301},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Rheumatoid arthritis","Bronchitis"]}}
