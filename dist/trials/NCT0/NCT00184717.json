The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of somatropin in children born small for gestational age (SGA) in Japan.\n\nIn the main period, subjects will receive either active treatment for 104 weeks (two dosing regimens) or no treatment for 52 weeks followed by an extension period where subjects who received active treatment for 104 weeks (two years) will continue with the same treatment for further 156 weeks (three years) while those subjects who received no treatment for 52 weeks (one year) will be randomised to receive two dosing regimens for 208 weeks (four years). In total, subjects participate in trial for 260 weeks (five years).\n\nMain period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as GHLIQUID-1516 while the extension period is registered as GHLIQUID-1517.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) for Chronological Age (CA) at Week 260 - Subjects Received NN220 Treatment for 5 Years","timeFrame":"Week 0, week 260","effectByArm":[{"arm":"0.033 mg / NN-220","deltaMin":-2.9488,"sd":0.6368},{"arm":"0.067 mg / NN-220","deltaMin":-2.9047,"sd":0.6718}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22156542","24526136","27799945"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":31},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract inflammation","Influenza","Bronchitis","Pharyngitis"]}}
