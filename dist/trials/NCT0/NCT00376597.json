Lymphedema is a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling in an arm or leg if lymph vessels are blocked, damaged, or removed by surgery. A personalized physical therapy intervention and education materials may be better than education materials alone in preventing lymphedema in women with breast cancer who are undergoing axillary lymph node dissection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Were Lymphedema-free 18 Months After Randomization","timeFrame":"18 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Lymphedema Education)","deltaMin":114,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Lymphedema Education, Physical Therapy)","deltaMin":135,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":76,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33079411","33079393"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
