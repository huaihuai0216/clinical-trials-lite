The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will prolong progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) compared to current SOC chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST1.1 As Assessed by Central Imaging Vendor","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 59 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":16.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care (SOC)","deltaMin":8.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["36369901","35427471","33812497","33264544"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26099&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":62,"n":153},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Vomiting","Decreased appetite"]}}
