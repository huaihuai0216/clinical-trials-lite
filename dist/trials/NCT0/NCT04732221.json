The treatment dose with the best efficacy and safety profile in the phase 2 cohort base period will be selected for use in the second part (Phase 3) of the study. The primary hypothesis of Phase 2 is that at least one frespaciguat dose is superior to placebo in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from baseline at week 12.\n\nThe purpose of the second part (Phase 3) of the study is to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of frespaciguat at the selected dose compared to placebo during a 12 week base period followed by an extension period of up to 5 years. The primary hypothesis of Phase 3 is that frespaciguat is superior to placebo in increasing 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline at week 12. Due to sponsor's decision this phase/part was not conducted.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Phase 2 Cohort: Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) at 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"At baseline and 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Base Period: Placebo","deltaMin":4.3,"sd":4.45},{"arm":"Base Period: MK-5475 32 µg","deltaMin":-4.9,"sd":4.07},{"arm":"Base Period: MK-5475 100 µg","deltaMin":-17.6,"sd":4.07},{"arm":"Base Period: MK-5475 380 µg","deltaMin":-15.6,"sd":5.39}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.068"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Colombia","France","Germany","Greece","Israel","Italy","Mexico","New Zealand","Poland","Russia","Sweden","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39255991"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26191&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":41},"commonTop":["Headache","COVID-19","Cough","Upper respiratory tract infection","Accidental overdose"]}}
