SCORE2 is designed as a non-inferiority trial, with study eyes randomized to intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) every 4 weeks vs. intravitreal aflibercept (2.0 mg) every 4 weeks. SCORE2 aims to determine if bevacizumab is non-inferior to aflibercept for the treatment of macular edema associated with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with the primary outcome of visual acuity measured at Month 6.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Visual Acuity Letter Score at Month 6","timeFrame":"Month 0 to 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aflibercept","deltaMin":18.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bevacizumab","deltaMin":18.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27450625","27863843","28492860","29074161","29476687","29746405","30589922","32353052","32828880","34003964","33373715","28492910","37943541","37220815","36584835","35461831","34709363","33415354","31600368","31169862"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":180},"commonTop":["Conjunctival haemorrhage","Vitreous floaters","Visual acuity reduced","Eye pain","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
