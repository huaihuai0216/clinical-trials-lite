The researchers in this study wanted to find out if cream V61-044 might cause an allergic skin reaction to sunlight when applied to the skin in healthy participants. Cream V61-044 (brand name: LOTRIMIN ULTRA) is an approved drug used to treat infections caused by fungi (small growing organisms such as mold, mildew, yeast or mushrooms).\n\nParticipants joining this study underwent two study phases: in Induction phase, participants received the test cream and UV radiation twice a week for 3 weeks; after 10 days of rest, in Challenge phase participants received the test cream and UV radiation once again. In both phases, the test cream was applied to two test areas on the upper back of the participants and to one of the test area UV radiation was applied. Evaluation on the skin rash was conducted two days after each UV radiation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Photoallergic Reaction Evaluation Reported as Number of Test Site With Different Erythema Score During Challenge Phase - All Treated Subjects","timeFrame":"At 24, 48, and 72 hours following patch application","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Butenafine HCl 1% (BAY1896425) - Challenge Phase","deltaMin":325,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":137},"commonTop":["Headache","Toothache","Dysmenorrhea","Pain in extremity","Other (Ankle Sprain)"]}}
