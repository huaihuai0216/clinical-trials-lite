The degree of aortic dilation and response to beta-blockade (standard of care) vary in adults with Marfan syndrome. However, aortic stiffness is often present, and can be a predictor of aortic dilation and cardiovascular complications. In addition, adults with Marfan syndrome develop left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which can progress to heart failure. Aortic stiffness and diastolic dysfunction are important and logical therapeutic targets in adults with Marfan syndrome.\n\nTGF-beta mediates disease pathogenesis in Marfan syndrome and contributes to aortic stiffness. The angiotensin receptor blocker, losartan, inhibits TGF-beta activity and reverses aortic wall pathology in a Marfan mouse model. Losartan also decreases aortic stiffness and improves diastolic function in hypertension, renal disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nThis trial is a randomized, double-blind trial of 50 adults with Marfan syndrome, treated with 6 months of atenolol vs. losartan. Arterial tonometry for aortic stiffness and echocardiography for diastolic function will be performed at the beginning and end of treatment. A blood draw for serum markers of extracellular matrix turnover and inflammation will also be performed at 0 and 6 months. We plan to determine whether losartan decreases aortic stiffness and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction significantly more than atenolol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Aortic Biophysical Properties - Pulse Wave Velocity","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Subjects Randomized to Atenolol","deltaMin":-1.15,"sd":1.68},{"arm":"Subjects Randomized to Losartan","deltaMin":-0.22,"sd":0.59}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
