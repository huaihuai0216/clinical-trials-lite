The clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. As a result, serious health problems can develop. The increased clotting that occurs in TTP uses up the cells that help the blood to clot, called platelets. With fewer platelets available in the blood, bleeding problems can occur. People who have TTP may bleed underneath the skin forming purple bruises or purpura, or from the surface of the skin. TTP also can cause anemia, a condition in which red blood cells break apart faster than the body can replace them leading to lower than normal number of red blood cells.\n\nA lack of activity in the ADAMTS13 enzyme, a protein in the blood involved in blood clotting, causes TTP. The enzyme breaks up another blood protein called von Willebrand factor that clumps together with platelets to form blood clots. Some people are born with this condition, others get the condition during their life. Many people who born with TTP experience frequent flareups that need to be treated right away. If not treated It can be fatal or cause lasting damage, such as brain damage or a stroke. BAX 930 is a medicine that replaces ADAMTS13 and can prevent or control TTP flareups, called TTP events.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to compare the number of TTP events in people born with severe TTP when they treated with BAX 930 versus when they are treated with the standard treatment. Treatment will be given in 2 ways:\n\n* BAX 930 or standard treatment given to prevent TTP events from happening.\n* BAX 930 or standard treatment given to control an acute TTP event when it happens, according to the clinic's standard practice.\n\nBoth BAX 930 and standard treatment are given slowly through a vein (infusion).\n\nAt the first visit, the study doctor will check if you can participate in the study. If you are eligible and enter the study, you will follow an assigned schedule and either start with BAX 930 (Period 1) and then switch to standard treatment (Period 2) or start with standard treatment (Period 1) and then switch to BAX 930 (Period 2). Everyone will be treated with BAX 930 again for Period 3. Each Period will last approximately 6 months.\n\nIf you enter the study to control an acute TTP event, you will follow a schedule receiving either BAX 930 or standard care to treat your acute TTP event. Once the acute TTP event has gotten better, you can decide to continue in the study and be given treatment to prevent TTP events from happening, following the schedule above.\n\nAnother study's aim is to assess side effects from treatment with BAX 930 and standard treatment. To do that, the study doctor will ask you questions about your health at each study visit.\n\nThe study doctors will also check how long BAX 930 stays in the blood of the participants, over time. They will do this from blood samples taken after participants receive their specific infusions of BAX 930. This will happen at different times during the study.\n\n1 month after all treatment has been completed, participants will visit the clinic for a final check-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Acute Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) Events During Prophylactic Treatment","timeFrame":"Up to 74.5 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Prophylaxis Cohort: TAK-755 (Periods 1 and 2)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prophylaxis Cohort: TAK-755 (Period 3)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prophylaxis Cohort: SoC (Periods 1 and 2)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"0 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States","Austria","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38692292"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b5fc84db2bf003ab4602d"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":47},"commonTop":["Headache","Abdominal pain","Nasopharyngitis","Vomiting","Fatigue"]}}
