The investigators will also investigate whether sertraline treatment will improve quality of life and whether it is safe to use in patients with kidney disease. The study subject will be randomly assigned to take either sertraline or a placebo tablet for 12 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Exit in Depression Symptom Severity as Measured by the QIDS-C-16 Score.","timeFrame":"baseline to 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sertraline","deltaMin":-4.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-4.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.82"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23085503","29101402","35368605","31664940"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":97},"commonTop":["Nausea, indigestion, or vomiting","Insomnia","Diarrhea","Somnolence","Dizziness, syncope, or fall"]}}
