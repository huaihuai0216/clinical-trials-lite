This will provide initial clinical experience with the new Depot-BNT treatment model, while providing a rigorous test of whether Depot-BNT produces superior treatment outcome, compared to our best behavioral platform for oral naltrexone (BNT).\n\nThe following aims will be addressed:\n\nSpecific Aim #1: To test whether Depot-BNT increases retention in treatment and improves drug use outcome (urine-confirmed abstinent weeks) compared to our established model of BNT with oral naltrexone (BNT-Oral), and to explore whether Depot-BNT (vs BNT-Oral) improves key secondary outcomes including dysphoria, HIV risk behavior, and social functioning.\n\nSpecific Aim #2: To explore predictors of outcome on Depot-BNT, and mechanisms of attrition, in order to optimize Depot-BNT prior to further testing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Retention","timeFrame":"over the course of 24 weeks or length of study participation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Depot Naltrexone","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oral Naltrexone","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40342086"],"seeAlso":["http://www.stars.columbia.edu"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":28},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Anxiety","Diarrhea","depression"]}}
