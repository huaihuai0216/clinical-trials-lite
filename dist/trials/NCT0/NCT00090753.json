Eligible patients were those who were receiving stable maintenance therapy with methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in Phase II or III clinical studies. They continued to receive methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta or comparator ESAs at the same weekly dose and by the same route of administration (sc or iv) as in the qualifying studies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin Concentration to the Last Month of Study Participation","timeFrame":"Baseline to the end of the study (Up to 49 Months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methoxy Polyethylene Glycol-Epoetin Beta","deltaMin":-0.55,"sd":1.832},{"arm":"Comparator ESA","deltaMin":-0.38,"sd":1.614}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":249,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Panama","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":499,"n":748},"commonTop":["HYPERTENSION","DIARRHOEA","NASOPHARYNGITIS","PROCEDURAL HYPOTENSION","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION"]}}
