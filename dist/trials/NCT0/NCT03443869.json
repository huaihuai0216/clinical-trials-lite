The primary hypotheses are that LET is non-inferior to VGCV; and if non-inferiority is demonstrated, that LET is superior to VGCV, in preventing CMV disease through 52 weeks post-transplant.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Adjudicated Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Disease Through 52 Weeks Post-transplant","timeFrame":"Up to 52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Letermovir","deltaMin":10.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Valganciclovir","deltaMin":11.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":94,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Colombia","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","New Zealand","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37279999","40701254","38853607","38700045"],"seeAlso":["https://merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":118,"n":292},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Leukopenia","Tremor","Oedema peripheral","Urinary tract infection"]}}
