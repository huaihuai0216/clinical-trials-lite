Patients will be randomized 2:2:1 to receive a maximum of six 28-day cycles of either RO5072759 (1000 mg intravenous (iv) infusion, on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2-6) plus chlorambucil (0.5 mg/kg orally, days 1 and 15 of cycles 1-6), or rituximab (iv infusion day 1, 375 mg/m\\^2 cycle 1, 500 mg/m\\^2 cycles 2-6) plus chlorambucil, or chlorambucil alone. Anticipated time on study treatment is \\>6 months and follow-up for disease-progression and safety will be at least 5 years. In the US, this trial is sponsored/managed by Genentech.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Randomization to clinical cutoff date of 10 Oct 2017 (median observation 62.5 months from randomization)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil (GClb)","deltaMin":31.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chlorambucil (Clb)","deltaMin":11.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":261,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Egypt","Estonia","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","Switzerland","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38620092","33131249","31050355","24401022"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":113,"n":241},"commonTop":["Infusion related reaction","Neutropenia","Nausea","Thrombocytopenia","Anaemia"]}}
