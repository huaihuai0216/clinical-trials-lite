DT-PACE refers to a chemotherapy regimen for multiple myeloma consisting of Dexamethasone, Thalidomide, Cisplatin or Platinol, Adriamycin or doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Etoposide. Another purpose of this study is to find out if there will be fewer side effects with the new regimen of DT PACE-Melphalan, compared to melphalan alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Transplant With DT PACE-Melphalan Regimen of Chemotherapy vs. Transplant With Melphalan Alone.","timeFrame":"3 years depending on start date","effectByArm":[],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://myeloma.uams.edu"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":52},"commonTop":["neutropenic fever","nausea, vomiting, diarrhea & fever","DVT","pneumonia","Diverticulitis"]}}
