Participants were randomly assigned to either the bevacizumab (10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously \\[IV\\] once every 2 week \\[q2w\\]) or the placebo arm, in combination with radiation therapy (total dose 60 Gray \\[Gy\\], administered as 2 Gy fractions, 5 days/week) plus temozolomide (75 milligrams per meter squared \\[mg/m\\^2\\] oral administration \\[po\\] daily) for 6 weeks. After a 4 week treatment break, participants continued to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV q2w) or placebo, plus temozolomide (150-200 mg/m\\^2 po daily on days 1-5 of each 4 week cycle) for 6 cycles of maintenance treatment or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occured first. Following the maintenance phase, bevacizumab (15 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks \\[q3w\\]) or placebo monotherapy continued. The time on study treatment was until disease progression.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Co-Primary: Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator","timeFrame":"Randomization until PFS Event [Until data cutoff= 31 March 2012 (up to 31.4 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bevacizumab + RT + Temozolomide","deltaMin":10.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + RT + Temozolomide","deltaMin":6.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":133,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36346112","35842871","34980260","27006178","26809751","26014298","24552318","23529375"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":179,"n":461},"commonTop":["Nausea","Fatigue","Alopecia","Constipation","Headache"]}}
