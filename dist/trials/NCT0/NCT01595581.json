Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic (muscle promoting) steroid. It is essential for the development of male reproductive tissues and promotes increased muscle, bone mass, and the growth of body hair.\n\nThe investigators hope to learn whether testosterone given before and after ACL reconstructive surgery will increase muscle mass and strength and potentially improve recovery time following surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes in Lean Mass","timeFrame":"6, 12, and 24 weeks post operative","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Testosterone","deltaMin":2.8,"sd":1.7},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.1,"sd":1.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.35"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.48"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.74"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28840147","25481088"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":7},"commonTop":[]}}
