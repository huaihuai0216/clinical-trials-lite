Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either V114 or Prevnar 13™ followed 8 weeks later by a single dose of PNEUMOVAX™23. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of V114 in children 6 to 17 years of age inclusive infected with HIV and to evaluate the anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPs) serotype-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) at 30 days following vaccination with V114 or Prevnar 13™ by each vaccination group. There are no formal hypotheses.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Solicited Injection-Site Adverse Event Following Vaccination With V114 or Prevnar 13™","timeFrame":"Through 14 Days after Vaccination 1 (Up to Day 14)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V114","deltaMin":9.4,"sd":5.7},{"arm":"Prevnar 13™","deltaMin":5.9,"sd":3.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["South Africa","Thailand","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36939067"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":203},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Myalgia","Injection site swelling","Injection site induration","Headache"]}}
