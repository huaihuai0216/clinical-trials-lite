At the same time, vitamin D is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The investigators elected to conduct the current study in patients who will undergo colorectal surgery since these patients are historically at higher risk of developing SSIs and therefore would be ideal for future investigations.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent (%) Change in 25(OH)D 5 Days Following Supplementation With 100,000 IU Cholecalciferol","timeFrame":"Patients will be followed between the initial preoperative evaluation day and an average duration of 5 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cholecalciferol","deltaMin":8,"sd":6},{"arm":"Sugar Pill","deltaMin":-2,"sd":4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":28},"commonTop":[]}}
