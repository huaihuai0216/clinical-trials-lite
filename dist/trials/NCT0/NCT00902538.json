This study is to test efficacy and safety of the combination of OLM/AML and HCTZ in hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with OLM/AML alone. The following treatments will be included in the trial: OLM 40mg/AML 10mg; OLM 40mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg; OLM 40 mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg. The trial has four periods. The treatments that will be used are as follows:\n\nPeriod 1 - OLM 40mg/AML 10mg; Period 2 - OLM 40mg/AML 10mg or OLM 40mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or OLM 40 mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg; Period 3 - OLM 40mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg; Period 4 - Period 3 responders: OLM 40mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg; Period 4 - Period 3 non-responders: OLM 40mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or OLM 40 mg/AML 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (SeDBP) of the Triple Combinations OM/AML/HCTZ 40/10/12.5 and 40/10/25 mg vs. OM/AML 40/10 mg","timeFrame":"baseline (8 weeks) to 16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Olmesartan(OLM) 40 Mg-Amlodipine(AML) 10 mg","deltaMin":-6.1,"sd":0.55},{"arm":"OLM 40-AML 10-Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5","deltaMin":-7.1,"sd":0.55},{"arm":"OLM 40-AML 10-HCTZ 25","deltaMin":-8.9,"sd":0.55}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1187"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":117,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":2204},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral"]}}
