Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FSC) is an approved drug that is already in use for the treatment of COPD. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI 62.5/25 microgram \\[mcg\\] once daily administered via Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI) compared with fluticasone propionate /salmeterol (FSC) 250/50 mcg twice-daily when administered via ACCUHALER/DISKUS inhaler over a treatment period of 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. Eligible subjects will be equally randomized to UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg or FSC 250/50 mcg for 12 weeks. A safety follow-up assessment will be conducted approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) in 0 to 24 Hour Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume Over 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 84","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 84","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg","deltaMin":0.213,"sd":0.0137},{"arm":"FSC 250/50 mcg","deltaMin":0.112,"sd":0.0139}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","Chile","Mexico","Norway","Romania","Russia","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26006754"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":349},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
