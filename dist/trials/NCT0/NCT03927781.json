Patients undergoing ureteroscopy with stent placement will receive a single dose of 300 mg pregabalin PO in the preoperative area. This work will assess safety and feasibility of studying this regimen at our institution, with the aim of performing a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in the future.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With One or More Adverse Events Related to Study Drug","timeFrame":"Day of surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pregabalin 300mg","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Dry mouth","Pain","Increased appetite","Back pain","Fatigue"]}}
