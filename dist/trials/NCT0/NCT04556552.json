Recruitment will be from treatment programs in the greater Atlanta Metropolitan Region including the DeKalb Community Service Board residential, detoxification and other treatment programs which with over 30,000 patient visits per year represents the largest treatment program in one of two urban counties in greater Atlanta.\n\nThis trial involves a second phase after completing an exploratory study in 20 patients with OUDs to assess different timing parameters of nVNS effects on sympathetic measures and symptoms of craving, as well as modelling to verify and iteratively refine the methods for vagal nerve stimulation. The investigators in this trial will then apply nVNS comparing active (N=10) to sham (N=10) in OUD patients recently started on medication, looking at opioid craving, brain functional response with HR-PET, and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarker responses to imagery-induced opioid drug craving.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Opioid Craving Using Visual Analogue Scale","timeFrame":"Baseline, 5 minutes post-intervention","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Non-invasive Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS)","deltaMin":3.909,"sd":3.048},{"arm":"Sham Stimulation","deltaMin":6,"sd":2.16}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40548916","36041704"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
