Additionally, the investigators examined the association between response to intervention, serum adiponectin levels and adiponectin gene polymorphisms. The investigators hypothesized that (1) evening administration of anti-hypertensive medication will convert subjects from non-dipper to dipper status, improve mean nocturnal blood pressure (BP), and improve nocturnal BP load, (2) evening administration of anti-hypertensive medication will reduce albuminuria, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and will decrease pulse wave velocity (PWV).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Are Non Dippers","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"New Medication","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":12,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39082471"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Hyperkalemia"]}}
