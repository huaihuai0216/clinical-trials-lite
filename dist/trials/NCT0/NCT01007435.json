Patients will be randomized to receive either (A) tocilizumab (8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus placebo, (B) tocilizumab (8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus methotrexate (7.5-20 mg po weekly), (C) tocilizumab (4 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus methotrexate (7.5-20 mg po weekly), or (D) placebo plus methotrexate (7.5-20 mg po weekly). Patients in groups C and D who have not achieved low disease activity at week 52 can receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) Remission Response at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo to Tocilizumab + Methotrexate","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 4 mg/kg + Methotrexate","deltaMin":31.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + Methotrexate","deltaMin":44.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + Placebo to Methotrexate","deltaMin":38.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":236,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Canada","China","Colombia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Mexico","New Zealand","North Macedonia","Panama","Peru","Philippines","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28389552","26511996"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":282},"commonTop":["Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Nasopharyngitis","Transaminases increased"]}}
