The purpose of this study is to explore if obstructive sleep apnea and its daytime symptom, excessive sleepiness, act as barriers to physical activity. We will examine if treatment of obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure results in increased physical activity in persons with type 2 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Physical Activity, Steps Walked","timeFrame":"after one-month treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1=Subjects With T2DM and OSA Who Are Treated With CPAP","deltaMin":5892,"sd":3841},{"arm":"2=Subjects With T2DM and OSA Who Are Treated With Sham-CPAP","deltaMin":6071,"sd":2714}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
