Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits, hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands.\n\nCurrent therapies have limited effectiveness, significant side effects, and can be invasive and costly. Sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) is a novel soft-drug in development for the topical treatment of hyperhidrosis.\n\nThis Phase 3 study will assess the safety and efficacy of sofpironium bromide, 15% gel versus vehicle (2 treatment arms), applied for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants (Vehicle Arm vs. Sofpironium Bromide Gel, 15%) With and Without an Observed â‰¥2-point Improvement in Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary-7 Item Total Score From Baseline to End of Treatment","timeFrame":"Total Trial Participation was approximately 11-15 weeks; outcome measure time frame: Baseline (and treatment start) through to end of treatment, taking approximately 6 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active","deltaMin":84,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vehicle","deltaMin":54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":173},"commonTop":["DRY MOUTH","APPLICATION SITE PAIN","MYDRIASIS","APPLICATION SITE PRURITUS","APPLICATION SITE DERMATITIS"]}}
