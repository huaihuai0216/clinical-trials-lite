The safety of apixaban will also be studied.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Adjudicated Venous Thromboembolic Event-related and All-cause Deaths With Onset During the Intended-treatment Period","timeFrame":"Day of randomization to later of 2 days after last dose or 14 days after first dose; 14 days after randomization for those who did not receive study drug","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Apixaban, 2.5 mg BID","deltaMin":15.06,"sd":null},{"arm":"Enoxaparin, 40 mg QD","deltaMin":24.37,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":122,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Chile","China","Colombia","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Malaysia","Mexico","Norway","Philippines","Poland","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35570249","23279103","20206776"],"seeAlso":["http://www.bms.com/clinical_trials/Pages/Investigator_Inquiry_form.aspx"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":72,"n":1501},"commonTop":["Nausea","Deep vein thrombosis","Vomiting","Constipation"]}}
