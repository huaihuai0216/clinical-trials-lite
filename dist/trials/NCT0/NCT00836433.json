One is a traditional falls education program using web-based modules, feedback of quality indicators, and meetings with influential peers. The other is a 12 week program that trains staff to form better connections and use effective communication strategies with a diverse network of co-workers, so that problem solving about resident problems is enhanced. The study will test whether the second intervention increases the effectiveness of the traditional falls education program.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Fall-related Process Measures","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FALLS","deltaMin":0.4,"sd":0.16},{"arm":"CONNECT + FALLS","deltaMin":0.32,"sd":0.13}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21331567","22376375"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24279686","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23704219"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":361},"commonTop":[]}}
