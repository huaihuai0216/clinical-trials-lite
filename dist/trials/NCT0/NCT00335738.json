Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. Sometimes, after surgery, no additional treatment is needed for the tumor until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"At 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1 (Identified by Central Review as High Risk)","deltaMin":0.9394,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2 (Identified by Central Review as Not High Risk)","deltaMin":0.9953,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":16,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":56,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","India","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":93},"commonTop":["Febrile neutropenia","Neutrophil count decreased","Anaphylaxis","Platelet count decreased","Vomiting"]}}
