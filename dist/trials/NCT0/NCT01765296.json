The primary efficacy parameter is the difference from Baseline to Week 6 in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis (WOMAC)-Pain subscale.\n* Extended Safety Study The objective of the Extended Safety Study is to collect a total of 24 weeks of safety data for CG100649 including the initial 6 weeks of safety data, and an additional 18 weeks of safety data for those subjects who agree on the consent form to continue into the Extended Safety Study. Subjects will be administered CG100649 2 mg only during 18 weeks of Extended Safety Study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in WOMAC-Pain Subscale","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":26.8,"sd":4.58},{"arm":"CG100649 2 mg","deltaMin":27.9,"sd":5.01},{"arm":"Celecoxib 200 mg","deltaMin":27.7,"sd":5.08}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.011"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.425"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":71},"commonTop":["Dyspepsia","Oedema Peripheral","Diarrhoea","Abdominal Pain Upper","Urticaria"]}}
