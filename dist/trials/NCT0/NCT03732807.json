The study is placebo-controlled, meaning that some patients entering the study will not receive active study drug but will receive tablets with no active ingredients (a placebo). This is a dose-ranging study, investigating 5 different dosing regimens. It will be double-blinded, meaning that the sponsor, the study doctors, the staff, and the patients will not know whether a patient is on active study drug (or the dose) or placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With an Absolute Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score of Less Than or Equal to 20 at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) 200 mg Then 50 mg","deltaMin":30.65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) 200 mg Then 30 mg","deltaMin":22.31,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) 50 mg","deltaMin":23.39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) 30 mg","deltaMin":14.29,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ritlecitinib (PF-06651600) 10 mg","deltaMin":1.69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.54,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG005","p":"<0.000001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG005","p":"<0.000001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG005","p":"<0.000001"},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG005","p":"0.000154"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":155,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","Chile","China","Colombia","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Japan","Mexico","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40261547","39962358","39441519","39328096","39254890","38263353","37917289","37707764","37403610","37062298"],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=B7981015"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":131},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Acne","Folliculitis"]}}
