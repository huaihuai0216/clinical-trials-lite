Dermatitis is a common side effect of radiation treatment, but few effective treatments have been developed for it. Curcumin is a natural compound found in both turmeric and curry powder. It has been used for centuries as a spice (curry), a food coloring and as a food preservative. Curcumin is non-toxic and has been found to enhance the functions of normal tissues..","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Radiation Dermatitis Severity Score","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Curcumin","deltaMin":2.02,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.99,"sd":0.06}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.6555"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":344},"commonTop":[]}}
