Trafermin 0.01% cutaneous spray product kit consisting of a glass bottle containing lyophilized trafermin, a glass bottle with solvent for solution and a spray part to fit the glass bottle after reconstitution of the final product.\n\nThe investigators conduct a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study consisting of a placebo run-in phase (2w), a treatment phase (max. 12w) and a follow-up phase (3mo+6mo). The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a superior wound closure rate of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) of neuropathic origin after 12 weeks topical daily application of trafermin 0.01% spray compared with placebo, in addition to best local care (off-loading, dressings). Approximately 210 patients will be randomized and it is planned that this study will be conducted at approximately 30 investigational sites in an estimated 4 countries in Europe (Czech Republic,France,Hungary,Italy,).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Wound Closure Rate of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) of Neuropathic Topical Daily Application of Trafermin 0.01% Spray Compared With Placebo, in Addition","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trafermin","deltaMin":14.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":10.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4109"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["Czechia","France","Hungary","Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":99},"commonTop":["Diabetic foot","Diabetic foot infection"]}}
