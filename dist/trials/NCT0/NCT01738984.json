Moms will select from a menu of 98, 10-minute exercise videos demonstrating yoga, aerobics, and strengthening exercises. They select and sequence together exercise videos personalized to their fitness level, form of exercise, and the choice to actively exercise with her baby or alone. The primary health goal of the MomZing Program is to increase home-based Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MPVA) minutes per week in new mothers and to maintain their exercise increases over time as their baby grows.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that women that use the MomZing Program will have greater increases in physical activity and fewer will return to cigarette smoking or alcohol use, compared to women who use a standard \"mommy and me\" exercise DVD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Minutes Per Week of Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity (MPVA Min/wk) Assessed at 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MomZing Web Program","deltaMin":217.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Exercise DVD","deltaMin":203.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mamamove.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":250},"commonTop":["Emergency appendectomy","Broken foot bone","Torn meniscus","Surgery for herniated disk, pinched nerve"]}}
