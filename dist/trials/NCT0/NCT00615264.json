DiaPep277 acts on the immune system and is expected to prevent further destruction of the beta-cells by stimulating regulatory responses, without causing immunological suppression.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide AUC at 24 Months","timeFrame":"Baseline and 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DiaPep277","deltaMin":-3.848,"sd":0.4666},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-4.348,"sd":0.4584}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2851"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["Austria","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Israel","Italy","South Africa","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24757230","24408401"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":225},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Influenza","Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications","Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders","Upper respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
