Any improvement in FEV1 is considered clinically meaningful, however, this trial has set a threshold of 80 mL for the purposes of determining an appropriate sample size for statistical power while retaining trial feasibility in an orphan disease population","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in FEV1 (mL) From Baseline (Visit 1) Over the 26-week Treatment Period (to Visit 4).","timeFrame":"26 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Arm A","deltaMin":63,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B - Control","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.020"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":100,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Mexico","New Zealand","Poland","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","South Africa","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33715994"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":207},"commonTop":["Condition Aggravated","Cough","Haemoptysis","Headache","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
