CP is caused by damage to or abnormalities inside the developing brain that disrupt the brain's ability to control movement and maintain posture and balance. The signs of CP usually appear in the early months of life, although specific diagnosis may be delayed until the age of 2 years or older. TEV-50717 (deutetrabenazine, also known as SD-809) has already provided evidence for safe and effective use in 2 other hyperkinetic movement disorders, namely chorea in Huntington's disease (HD) and tardive dyskinesia (TD). Currently, there is no approved treatment available for Dyskinesia in cerebral palsy (DCP). The available treatment options address some of the manifestations of DCP. The study population will include pediatric and adolescent participants (6 through 18 years of age) with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder, who have had nonprogressive CP symptoms since infancy (â‰¤2 years of age). Diagnosis of DCP is based on the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe criteria.\n\nThis is a Phase 3 study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TEV-50717 administered as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once daily in participants (age 6 through 18 years, inclusive) with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder. The study will be conducted in multiple centers and will use 2 parallel treatment groups (ie, TEV-50717 and placebo) in which participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio.\n\n\"Predominant\" in this instance indicates that the choreiform movement disorder is the main cause of impairment or distress.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Movement Disorder-Childhood Rating Scale (MD-CRS) Part II Total Score (Movement Disorder Severity, Centrally Read) at Week 15","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 15","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.4,"sd":1.09},{"arm":"TEV-50717","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":0.88}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.335"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","Israel","Italy","Poland","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Vomiting","Drooling","Dystonia","Nausea"]}}
