Studies in adults have shown that obesity, now considered to be a disease state, is a modifier of the effect of drugs on the body as well as how the body handles the drug.The anesthetic management of obese children poses a variety of significant challenges which include determination of the appropriate dose of anesthetic intravenous agents. Dosing of most drugs is calculated based on the effective dose in 50% of patients but the more practical and required information is the effective dose in 95%(ED95%)of patients. The aim of this study is to determine the effective dose in 95% of patients(children). The hypothesis is the ED95 of propofol in obese children will be higher than that of non-obese children.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Dose of Propofol That Caused Loss of Consciousness in 95% (ED95) of Obese and Non-obese Children","timeFrame":"20 seconds","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Obese Children","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Non-obese","deltaMin":2.125,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17585226","20585055"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}
