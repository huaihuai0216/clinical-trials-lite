Interstitial brachytherapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Combining interstitial brachytherapy with external-beam radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether interstitial brachytherapy is more effective with or without external-beam radiation therapy in treating prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interstitial brachytherapy with or without external-beam radiation therapy in treating patients who have prostate cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"5-Year Freedom From Progression Rate","timeFrame":"From randomization to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"EBRT + Brachytherapy","deltaMin":85.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Brachytherapy Only","deltaMin":83.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.21"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":170,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37315297"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":52,"n":282},"commonTop":["Late RT Toxicity: Bladder/Other GU : NOS","Late RT Toxicity: Other : NOS","Urinary frequency","Late RT Toxicity: Small/Large Intestine: NOS","Late RT Toxicity: Other GI : NOS"]}}
