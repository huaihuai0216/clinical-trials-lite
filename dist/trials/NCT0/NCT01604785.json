Initial retrospective review of the investigators experience with propofol for migraine in children suggests that it is safe and may be more effective than standard treatments used in the emergency department. The investigators retrospective series had a small subject population and a larger study is needed to compare propofol to current available treatments.\n\nStandard treatment currently consists of a \"cocktail\" of medications that include anti-nausea medicines (metoclopramide and diphenhydramine) and an analgesic (ketorolac) as well as intravenous fluids. Subjects assigned to the experimental group (Propofol) will receive the same intravenous fluids and up to five doses of propofol. All subjects will undergo assessment of their pain (self-rated on a scale from 0-10) before and after treatment. Post-visit clinical data will be collected from the subject's medical record and subjects will be called by telephone 24-48 hours after discharge from the emergency department to ask how they are doing and whether they required any additional treatments such as home medications or by other medical professionals other than OHSU.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Self-Assessed Pain","timeFrame":"15 minutes after administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Treatment Group","deltaMin":51,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Treatment Group","deltaMin":59,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":["Extrapyramidal Symptoms","Hypoxemia"]}}
