The safety of participating subjects will be assessed for up to 54 weeks. The long-term efficacy of C1-INH will also be assessed. Each eligible subject will enter the treatment phase, wherein subjects will be randomized to treatment with either low- or medium-volume C1-INH. Subjects who have an insufficient treatment response during the study will be given an opportunity to undergo a dose increase. The study aims to enroll eligible subjects who completed study CSL830\\_3001 (NCT01912456). Subjects who did not participate in study CSL830\\_3001 may also participate, if eligible and if space permits. Subjects from the United States (US) who complete Treatment Period 2 will be allowed to participate in an Extension Period. During the Extension Period participating US subjects will continue to receive treatment with open-label CSL830 for up to an additional 88 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Person-time Incidence Rates (Subject Based)","timeFrame":"Up to 146 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CSL830 (40)","deltaMin":0.01,"sd":null},{"arm":"CSL830 (60)","deltaMin":0.03,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Romania","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36326435","33588897","32042283","30772477"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":63},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Headache","Injection site bruising"]}}
