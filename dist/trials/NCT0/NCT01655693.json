Patients with HCC with or without cirrhosis and with good liver functions are eligible. Only those who can not benefit from treatment for which efficacy is demonstrated are eligible.\n\nThese patients are usually proposed either best standard of care (BSC) or participation to clinical trials. Patients eligible for the RELIVE study will receive either DT at 20 mg/m2 or DT at 30 mg/m2 or the BSC.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause with initial assessment up to 24 months and follow-up assessment up to 45 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Doxorubicin Transdrug (DT) 20 mg/m2 Group","deltaMin":10.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Doxorubicin Transdrug at 30 mg/m2","deltaMin":8.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Doxorubicin Transdrug Pooled","deltaMin":9.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Best Standard of Care (BSC)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":">0.991"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.796"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Egypt","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Lebanon","Spain","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30954567"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":37,"n":122},"commonTop":["Asthenia","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Anaemia","Oedema peripheral"]}}
