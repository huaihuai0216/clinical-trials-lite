The primary purpose of this study was to demonstrate consistency in the immune responses of participants receiving 3 separate lots of V920 through 28 days postvaccination. In addition to the 3 lot groups, a high-dose group and a placebo group were studied. A subset of participants representative of all treatment groups continued through 24 months postvaccination in the extension study for the evaluation of long-term safety. The primary hypothesis states that the geometric mean titer of anti-Zaire ebolavirus envelope (ZEBOV) glycoprotein antibody at 28 days postvaccination is equivalent across the three consistency lots.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Titer of Anti-ZEBOV Glycoprotein Antibody","timeFrame":"Day 28 postvaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V920 Consistency Lot A","deltaMin":1183.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"V920 Consistency Lot B","deltaMin":1266,"sd":null},{"arm":"V920 Consistency Lot C","deltaMin":1346,"sd":null},{"arm":"V920 High-dose Lot","deltaMin":1291.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28549145","33782211","31505665","28647166"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":265},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Headache","Pyrexia","Arthralgia","Injection site swelling"]}}
