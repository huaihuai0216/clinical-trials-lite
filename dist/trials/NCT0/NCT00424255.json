Lapatinib or placebo will be administered post-operatively in combination with chemoradiotherapy followed by maintenance with lapatinib or placebo for 1 year. The primary goal is to determine if lapatinib is effective at reducing the recurrence of the disease in these high-risk patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease Free Survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"From randomization until the earliest date of disease recurrence or death due to any cause (average of 101 study weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lapatinib 1500 mg","deltaMin":53.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2251"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4502"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":117,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Canada","China","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Ireland","Italy","Philippines","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39415507","36821132","26527790"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":133,"n":336},"commonTop":["Mucosal inflammation","Nausea","Dry mouth","Vomiting","Rash"]}}
