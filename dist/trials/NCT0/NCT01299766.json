Patients with MCI are at increased risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD); we propose that increasing participation in activities will prevent cognitive decline and may delay the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We will test this hypothesis by conducting a clinical trial in which older AAs with MCI (aged 65 years and older) will be randomized to Behavior Activation (BA) (a behavioral intervention that increases participation in daily activities) or Supportive Therapy (ST) (a person-centered psychotherapy that involves active listening and offering support focusing on participants' problems and concerns). We hypothesize that BA-treated subjects will have fewer declines in cognitive and functional abilities, fewer depressive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and better quality of life than ST-treated subjects at 24 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Decline of 6 Points on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)","timeFrame":"24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Behavior Activation","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Supportive Therapy (ST)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".02"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31087388","30208380","27000348","25811797","22406101"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":40,"n":111},"commonTop":[]}}
