In Part B, patients will receive multiple doses of famciclovir alone or with concomitant oral anti-herpes therapy to assess safety and tolerability. Part B will start only after PK data from Part A had been analyzed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Safety and Tolerability of a Single-dose of Famciclovir in Part A of the Study.","timeFrame":"8 hours and 24 hours after study drug administration (Part A)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1 to < 2 Years","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"2 to <6 Years","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"6 to <=12 Years","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"13 to <= 18 Years","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States","Panama"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19273678"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["Headache","Vomiting","Abdominal pain upper","Diarrhea","Pyrexia"]}}
