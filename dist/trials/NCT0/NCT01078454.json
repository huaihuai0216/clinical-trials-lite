Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of plasma cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of plasma cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether giving melphalan together with dexamethasone is more effective with or without bortezomib in treating systemic amyloidosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients With Hematologic Overall Response (Partial Response [PR]+ Very Good PR [VGPR]+ Amyloid Complete Response [ACR]+ Stringent Complete Response [sCR]) After 3 Months (3 Cycles) of Therapy","timeFrame":"Assessed at 3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Mel-Dex)","deltaMin":0.33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (B-Mel-Dex)","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":20,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":209,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":6},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Anemia","Anorexia","Generalized muscle weakness"]}}
