A total of 300 subjects will be recruited from social centres for elders located in different districts in Hong Kong. Baseline clinical examination will be conducted by a single calibrated examiner in the social centres using an intra-oral LED light, mouth mirrors and probes. Subjects will be randomly allocated into the three study groups and receive interventions accordingly. Follow-up examinations at 6-month intervals will be carried out to assess the clinical outcomes, i.e. whether new root caries has developed and whether the active root caries found at baseline have become arrested (remineralized and hardened) or not. Photographs of the arrested lesions will be taken to assess their colour. Results of this study will provide the much needed evidence to guide the dental professionals in Hong Kong and worldwide in deciding on the most appropriate intervention for the prevention and treatment of this common dental disease of the older adults.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of New Tooth Root Caries Lesions","timeFrame":"30 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":1.1,"sd":0.16},{"arm":"Silver Diammine Fluoride","deltaMin":0.43,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Silver Diammine Fluoride and KI","deltaMin":0.56,"sd":0.11}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"56 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30938645"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":108},"commonTop":[]}}
