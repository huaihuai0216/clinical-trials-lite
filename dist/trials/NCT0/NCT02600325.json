Grazoprevir (MK-5172) and elbasvir (MK-8742) combination therapy is such a, albeit not yet EMA/FDA approved combination DAA therapy.\n\nIt is likely that the synergistic effect of the host's immune response and antiviral therapy when given during the first 6 months of HCV infection makes antiviral therapy during acute HCV infection more effective. In this study the investigators would like to document that treatment of acute HCV with grazoprevir (MK-5172), elbasvir (MK-8742) is effective and can ben shortened from 12 to 8 weeks for HCV genotype 1 and 4 infection without substantial loss in efficacy.\n\nStudy design and intervention:\n\nProspective open label interventional clinical trial in which 80 acute HCV genotype 1 or 4 patients co-infected with HIV will receive 8 weeks of grazoprevir and elbasvir (a once-daily combination tablet).\n\nStudy population:\n\n80 Adult HIV positive patients with an acute HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection from 10 HIV treatment centers in the Netherlands and Belgium will be included.\n\nPrimary endpoint: Sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks after the end of therapy in ITT study population (=genotype 1 and 4).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"SVR12 (Reinfection Not Considered Failure)","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Group","deltaMin":79,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["Belgium","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36146760","30660617"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":80},"commonTop":["Fatique","headache","insomnia","mood changes","dyspepsia"]}}
