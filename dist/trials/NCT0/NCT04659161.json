The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice daily \\[BID\\]) versus placebo in reducing Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate improvement in disease severity and symptoms, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in adult inpatients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 5","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 5","effectByArm":[{"arm":"KarXT","deltaMin":-21.2,"sd":1.652},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-11.6,"sd":1.6}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40215379","40212458","40047530","38104575"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":126},"commonTop":["Constipation","Dyspepsia","Headache","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
