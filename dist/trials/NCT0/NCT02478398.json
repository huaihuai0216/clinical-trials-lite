The primary hypothesis of this study is that administration of short ragweed pollen allergen extract sublingual immunotherapy tablets to children 5 to 17 years of age, compared with placebo, will result in a significant reduction in the combination of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and medication use over the peak ragweed season (RS).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Combined Score (TCS) During the Peak Ragweed Season (RS)","timeFrame":"The 15-day period during the ragweed season with the highest moving pollen average","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Short Ragweed Pollen Allergen Extract","deltaMin":4.39,"sd":3.85},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.12,"sd":6.57}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["34886880","32926419","32548677","32304832"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":513},"commonTop":["Throat irritation","Oral pruritus","Ear pruritus","Nausea","Headache"]}}
