The protocol incorporates risk mitigation strategies developed in partnership with the FDA to manage known and potential risks associated with the treatment of tocilizumab. Patients will be randomized to receive tocilizumab either 4 mg/kg intravenous (iv) or 8 mg/kg iv with concomitant non-biologic DMARDs, or 8 mg/kg iv without concomitant non-biologic DMARDs, every 4 weeks, for a total of 6 infusions. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 500-1000 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Experiencing at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the 24 Week Treatment Period","timeFrame":"24 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg Monotherapy","deltaMin":5.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 4 mg/kg + DMARD","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + DMARD","deltaMin":8.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":227,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22972745"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":138},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Rheumatoid arthritis","Sinusitis","Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
