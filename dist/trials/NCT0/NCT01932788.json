We will study women of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds who will receive either the current vitamin D standard of 400 IU/day (in the prenatal vitamin) or 4000 IU/day (dose found in previous pregnancy studies to achieve vitamin D sufficiency).\n\nThis research is sponsored by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Medical University of South Carolina. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and infection-fighting properties of the body in relationship to vitamin D levels. This study is being done at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) clinics, and will involve approximately 450 volunteers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Greater Than 100 Nmol/L 25(OH)D (Converted Vitamin D)","timeFrame":"20 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vitamin D 4000 IU","deltaMin":110,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Gummy Vitamin","deltaMin":22,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21197089","20640974","21706518","22623177","23131462","23314242","39077939"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":135},"commonTop":["Miscarriage","Preterm birth"]}}
