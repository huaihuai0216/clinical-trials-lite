The purpose is to evaluate the acceptability concerning a warming sensation effect and its potential benefit in the target population.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the warming sensation caused by the excipient IFF flavor 316 282, in a syrup containing paracetamol 500 mg + phenylephrine 10mg + Guaifenesin 200 mg per 30 ml syrup. The syrup contains (0.15% w/v) warming flavor.\n\nThe Secondary Objectives are to assess subject acceptability of the syrup and the safety and tolerability of the syrup. The study will be run in fifty-six (56) subjects suffering from symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) for 7 days or less, e.g. nasal congestion associated with colds and flu symptoms such as pain, headache and/or fever. Subjects must have one or more symptoms per category:\n\n1. mild to moderate body pain, headache, fever or sore throat\n2. nasal congestion (blocked nose) with or without rhinorrhea (runny nose) or sneezing\n3. productive cough Adolescents will be included in the study population","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Warming Sensation Caused by the Excipient IFF Flavor 316 282, in a Syrup Containing Paracetamol 500 mg + Phenylephrine 10mg + Guaifenesin 200 mg Per 30 ml Syrup","timeFrame":"1 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","deltaMin":34.6,"sd":27.96}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":51},"commonTop":["Pyrexia"]}}
