Study participants were randomized to one of the two treatment groups or to placebo and took the study drug for 16 weeks. At this timepoint, participants were evaluated for erythroid response. If participants did not achieve at least a minor erythroid response, they were discontinued from the Double-Blind phase and entered into the Open-Label phase. All erythroid responders at Week 16 were to continue in the Double-Blind phase for up to 52 weeks. For participants that were still responding at the end of Double-Blind phase, they could then rollover into the Open-Label phase for an additional two years. Participants could remain on study for up to a total of 3 years. All participants who discontinued from the study were followed every 4 months for overall survival and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants Who Achieved Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Independence for >= 26 Weeks (182 Days)","timeFrame":"Up to 52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lenalidomide 5 mg","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lenalidomide 10 mg","deltaMin":23,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["Belgium","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28651604","24682512","21753188","21109690"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":67},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Diarrhoea","Thrombocytopenia","Constipation","Nausea"]}}
