The primary hypotheses are that 1) V114 is noninferior to Prevnar 13™ as measured by the serotype specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) for 13 shared serotypes at 30 days postvaccination and that 2) V114 is superior to Prevnar 13™ as measured by serotype-specific OPA GMTs for 2 unique serotypes in V114 at 30 days postvaccination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event","timeFrame":"Up to Day 5 postvaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V114","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevnar 13™","deltaMin":11.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.175"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.488"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["United States","Canada","Japan","Spain","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34507861"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":602},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Fatigue","Myalgia","Injection site swelling","Headache"]}}
