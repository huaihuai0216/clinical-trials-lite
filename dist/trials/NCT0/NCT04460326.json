Despite the fact that basal/bolus insulin therapy has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes in patients, achieving good glucose control remains a challenge.\n\nThis study examines the effects of Fiasp (a faster acting insulin) on blood sugars after meals compared to another type of insulin known as Novolog. The study will be performed in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital, who are not in the intensive care unit, and who are being seen by the inpatient diabetes consult team. Eligible participants will be treated with Fiasp or Novolog injected multiple times a day before meals and at bedtime, in addition to a once daily injection of insulin glargine as basal insulin. Which type of meal time insulin (Fiasp vs Novolog) the subject gets is decided by chance, like the flip of a coin. Insulin doses will be started and titrated based on a protocol. All the subjects will wear a blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)) sensor placed in their arm which they will wear for 72 hours during the study. The glucose values from the CGM, collected during the time it is worn, will be downloaded and compared to assess the response to the two different types of insulins - Fiasp and Novolog. The goal is to determine if Fiasp works as well as or better than Novolog in controlling blood sugars, particularly after meals, in the subjects of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postprandial Glucose Control","timeFrame":"3 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1 Insulin Glargine and Novolog","deltaMin":36.18,"sd":29.78},{"arm":"Group 2 Insulin Glargine and Fiasp","deltaMin":45.22,"sd":32.63}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":61},"commonTop":["bleeding at CGM site"]}}
