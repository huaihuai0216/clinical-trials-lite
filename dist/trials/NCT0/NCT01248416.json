Growth Hormone (GH), plus drugs that stop puberty, increase height potential, but leave children sexually infantile at a critical time in development. Human and animal data show that estrogen, in females and males, is a principal regulator of the fusion of the growth plate in puberty. Using aromatase inhibitors (AIs), which block testosterone to estrogen conversion, in boys with different growth disorders, we have shown that AIs may have beneficial effects enhancing height potential in growth-retarded males, without affecting their puberty. However, no direct comparison of the effect of AIs alone vs. conventional GH treatment has been done to date. This study will assess the effect of AIs alone, GH alone and combination treatment in enhancing height potential in adolescent boys with idiopathic short stature.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Height","timeFrame":"0 to 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aromatase Inhibitor","deltaMin":14,"sd":0.8},{"arm":"Growth Hormone","deltaMin":17.1,"sd":0.9},{"arm":"Aromatase Inhibitor and Growth Hormone","deltaMin":18.9,"sd":0.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States","Chile"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27710241"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":25},"commonTop":[]}}
