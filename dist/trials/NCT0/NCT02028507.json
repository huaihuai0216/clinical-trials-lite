Postmenopausal patients with HR+/HER2 MBC are eligible if resistant to previous nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) (letrozole or anastrozole) in cohort 1 or previous aromatase inhibitors (AI) (letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane) in cohort 2 defined as: recurrence while on or within 12 months after the end of adjuvant treatment with NSAI/AI or progression while on or within 1 month after the end of treatment with NSAI/AI for MBC. Previous chemotherapy is permitted either in the (neo)adjuvant setting and/or as first line for MBC. Patients must have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1 or bone lesions, lytic or mixed, in the absence of measurable disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Through study treatment, and average of 8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort 1: Palbociclib Plus Exemestane","deltaMin":7.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 1: Capecitabine","deltaMin":9.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2: Palbociclib Plus Fulvestrant","deltaMin":7.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2: Capecitabine","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["Austria","Hungary","Israel","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33385521","35429901","34425406","36749874"],"seeAlso":["http://www.geicam.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":150},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Neutrophil count decreased","Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome","Diarrhea","Hypertension"]}}
