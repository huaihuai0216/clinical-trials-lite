In the first occasion, a participant will complete a brief pain assessment on the day of enrollment. The rest of a participant's active participation will take place on one day (the day of surgery) and last approximately 20 minutes, after which active participation will end.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Median Post-Procedural Pain Score","timeFrame":"Day of surgery (last of two study visits), assessed within 3 hours of radioactive tracer injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ice Pack","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Buzzy(R)","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lidocaine Patch","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lidocaine Patch and Buzzy(R)","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":44},"commonTop":[]}}
