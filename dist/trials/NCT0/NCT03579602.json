It is often difficult for surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. Tozuleristide is a drug that is thought to attach to tumor tissue and then fluoresces (glows) when a special light from the Canvas is shined on it. It is hypothesized that tozuleristide, when imaged with the Canvas, will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of the tumor or other ambiguous tissue in real-time as they operate. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well tozuleristide imaged with Canvas work at helping to distinguish between tumor and normal tissue during surgery in pediatric primary central nervous system tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sensitivity and Specificity of Tozuleristide Fluorescence to Detect Tumor in Equivocal (Ambiguous) Tissue During Surgery When Imaged With the Canvas System","timeFrame":"During surgery (which occurs at least 1 hour post tozuleristide administration)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 2","deltaMin":79.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Month","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":11},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Procedural pain","Constipation","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
