In aim 1, the study staff will determine the biochemical differences between ≥30 day-old versus ≤10 day-old units. In aim 2, the study staff will determine the physiologic effects of the transfused blood in a patient with SCD. Lastly, in aim 3, the study staff will explore the clinical implications of receiving older red cells over a 3 month period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Biochemically Old Red Cell Units","timeFrame":"through third transfusion, an average of 18 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"≤10 Day Blood","deltaMin":0.71,"sd":null},{"arm":"≥30 Day Blood","deltaMin":0.86,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.051"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40608427"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":13},"commonTop":["Vaso-occlusive pain","Penile pain","Injury due to Fall","Fistula Swelling","Influenza"]}}
