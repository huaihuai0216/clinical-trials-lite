In addition, this study aims at assessing the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and antibody persistence (approximately 8-11 months following primary vaccination) of the Synflorix vaccine and Prevenar 13 vaccine after primary vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age with either Synflorix or Prevenar 13 vaccine or Prevenar 13 and Synflorix, respectively. This study also aims at assessing the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Synflorix vaccine when given as a booster dose at 12-15 months of age following primary vaccination at 2 and 4 months of age with either Synflorix vaccine or Prevenar 13 vaccine or Prevenar 13 and Synflorix respectively.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Grade 3 Adverse Events (AEs) (Solicited and Unsolicited) - Primary Period","timeFrame":"Within 31-day (Day 0-Day 30) after any dose of primary vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Synflorix Group","deltaMin":18,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevnar 1 Group","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevnar 2 Group","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Weeks","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33297773"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":97},"commonTop":["Pain (primary phase)","Irritability (primary phase)","Drowsiness (primary phase)","Pain (booster phase)","Irritability (booster phase)"]}}
