Within this design, the investigators will be able to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MPH treatment on cognitive functions.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Brain Activation","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methylphenidate, Non-retard","deltaMin":0.19,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Control: Placebo","deltaMin":-0.08,"sd":0.08}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.09"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":19},"commonTop":["Headache","common cold","Arthralgia","low back pain","Dizziness postural"]}}
