All patients in Group A received recombinant human growth hormone (Serostim速) 4 mg daily (the \"induction\" phase) for the first 12 weeks, and then were re-randomized to receive either placebo or Serostim 2 mg on alternate days (roughly equivalent to 1 mg daily) during Weeks 12-36 (the \"maintenance\" phase). All patients in Group B initially received placebo from baseline to Week 24, and then received Serostim速 4 mg daily from Weeks 24 to 36 (Grunfeld, 2007).\n\nIn the follow-up Study 25373, any subject who was enrolled in Serono Study 24380 and was assigned to Group A, who fully completed all study visits without a major protocol violation, was eligible to enroll to receive re-treatment with Serostim at a dose of 4 mg daily for 12 weeks. During study 25373, safety was monitored by recording of adverse events and measurement of urinalysis and laboratory blood tests to assess fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and routine biochemistry and hematology parameters. At Week 12 or at the time of study termination, subjects underwent re-assessment of body composition via anthropometry measurements and dual photon absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. In addition, at study termination, measurements of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), fasting lipid profile, and oral glucose tolerance testing were obtained.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Trunk Fat as Assessed by Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Scan","timeFrame":"baseline to 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Serostim","deltaMin":-1.7,"sd":1.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17592343"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":126},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Arthralgia","Hypoaesthesia","Blood glucose increased","Joint swelling"]}}
