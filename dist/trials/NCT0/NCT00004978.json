Patients will be followed over a minimum of 4 years to study the long-term effects of rIL-2 on their HIV disease progression.\n\nAnti-HIV therapy has been very successful in treating HIV positive patients and in keeping viral load (level of HIV in the blood) low. However, anti-HIV drugs cannot completely rid the body of the virus, and the immune system is never completely restored in HIV positive patients. Doctors hope that giving patients recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in addition to their anti-HIV therapy will help improve their immune systems and keep them healthier over a longer period of time. rIL-2 is a hormone naturally produced by the body during an immune response to a microbial infection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"New or Recurrent HIV Disease Progression Event Including Death","timeFrame":"from randomization through study end - median of 7.6 years follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"rIL-2","deltaMin":159,"sd":null},{"arm":"No rIL-2","deltaMin":165,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".55"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":248,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Morocco","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Singapore","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["10371503","9142122","11943448","15206062","19828532","26908541","24870935","22911697","20812949"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":466,"n":2071},"commonTop":["Myocardial infarction","Acute myocardial infarction","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea","Coronary artery disease"]}}
