Safety will be determined by comparing the rates of bleeding events, assessed using the modified International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis classification of Major Bleeding and Clinically Relevant Non Major Bleeding Events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First Adjudicated ISTH MBE or CRNMBE","timeFrame":"up to 30 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dabigatran Etexilate 110mg","deltaMin":151,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dabigatran Etexilate 150mg","deltaMin":154,"sd":null},{"arm":"Warfarin","deltaMin":264,"sd":null},{"arm":"Warfarin (Excluding Elder Patients Outside USA)","deltaMin":196,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0020"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":421,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Singapore","Slovakia","Slovenia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32562206","32389658","32252548","31439336","30015064","28844193"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":415,"n":972},"commonTop":["Epistaxis","Dyspnoea","Haematoma"]}}
