It is not yet known whether giving zoledronate together with vitamin D and calcium is more effective with or without strontium 89 or samarium 153 in treating patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium to see how well they work compared to zoledronate, vitamin D, calcium, and either strontium 89 or samarium 153 in preventing or delaying bone problems in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Development of a Malignant Skeletal-related Events (SRE)","timeFrame":"From randomization to last follow-up.
