Multiple clinical trials of cholesterol lowering therapy with statins have demonstrated that reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are associated with reductions in both LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and the systemic inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP). The Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) investigates if an anti-inflammatory agent commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis (low dose methotrexate (LDM)) can reduce CV morbidity and mortality among patients with a prior myocardial infarction or angiographically demonstrated multivessel coronary artery disease (GCO#13-1467).\n\nIn this ancillary CIRT imaging study, the investigators propose to use this well validated approach by non-invasive serial FDG-PET/CT imaging in a subset of patients enrolled in the main CIRT trial to directly visualize vascular inflammation. Once the subjects are enrolled in the main CIRT trial, baseline imaging will be done and follow up imaging will be done approximately 8 months after the baseline imaging.\n\n18FDG-PET imaging data will be acquired, analyzed centrally and results incorporated into the main CIRT database. The investigators hypothesize that LDM treatment will result in a significant decrease in plaque inflammation as measured by 18-FDG-PET/CT after 8 months as compared to placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Arterial Inflammation","timeFrame":"baseline and 8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Low Dose Methotrexate","deltaMin":0.03,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Missinjected dose (isotope)"]}}
