Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, lomustine, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving radiation therapy with chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known whether standard-dose radiation therapy is more effective than reduced-dose radiation therapy when given together with chemotherapy after surgery in treating young patients with medulloblastoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"Assessed at 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Low-dose Craniospinal Radiation (LDSCI)","deltaMin":76.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard-dose Craniospinal Radiation (SDCSI)","deltaMin":84.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":19,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":197,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Netherlands","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34110925"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":63},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Platelet count decreased","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Peripheral motor neuropathy"]}}
