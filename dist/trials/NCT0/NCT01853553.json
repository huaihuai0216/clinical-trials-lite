The study also will provide insight into how blocking aldosterone improves artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved. Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence upon which physicians can base recommendations to patients with ADPKD to decrease risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Flow Mediated Dilation at 6 Months.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Spironolactone","deltaMin":-0.2,"sd":3.2},{"arm":"Sugar Pill","deltaMin":-0.4,"sd":4.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30803706"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":28},"commonTop":[]}}
