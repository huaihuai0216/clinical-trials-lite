This study is designed to demonstrate the superiority of TDF 300mg QD over ADV 10mg QD in treating Chinese subjects with CHB (hepatitis B e antigen \\[HBeAg\\] positive subjects and HBeAg negative subjects). It will also provide long-term efficacy and safety data (up to 240 weeks) for TDF 300 mg administered once daily.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) <400 Copies/Milliliter (mL) at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TDF 300 mg","deltaMin":79,"sd":null},{"arm":"ADV 10 mg","deltaMin":18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30977033","25243325"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":257},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Hepatic steatosis","Nephrolithiasis","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
