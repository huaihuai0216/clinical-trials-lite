Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy and temozolomide are more effective than radiation therapy alone in treating glioblastoma multiforme.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy and temozolomide to see how well they work compared with radiation therapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"7 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Temozolomide","deltaMin":9.33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Radiation","deltaMin":7.62,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["Canada","Germany","Japan","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28296618","32632894","24117272"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":158,"n":271},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Alopecia","Speech impairment","Neuropathy-motor","Pain Head/headache"]}}
