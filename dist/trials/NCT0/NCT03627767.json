Subjects responding well to an initial open-label 12 week treatment of PF-04965842 (200 mg) taken orally once daily (QD) will be identified and randomized in a double-blind manner to receive 200 mg QD PF-04965842, 100 mg QD PF-04965842, or QD placebo. Efficacy and safety of 2 doses of PF-04965842 will be evaluated relative to placebo over 40 weeks. Subjects experiencing significant worsening of their symptoms, i.e., protocol-defined flare, enter 12 weeks rescue treatment and receive 200 mg PF-04965842 together with a marketed topical medicine. Eligible patients will have the option to enter a long-term extension study after completing the initial 12 week treatment, the 12 week rescue treatment, and the 40 week blinded treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Loss of Response: Double-blind (DB) Period","timeFrame":"From Day 1 of up to Week 40 of double blind period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PF-04965842 200 mg OL to Placebo DB","deltaMin":77.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"PF-04965842 200 mg OL to PF-04965842 100 mg+Placebo DB","deltaMin":39.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"PF-04965842 200 mg OL to PF-04965842 200 mg DB","deltaMin":16.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":235,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","China","Germany","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","Spain","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40028832","38896380","37036183","35342978","34406619"],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=B7451014"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":1233},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dermatitis atopic","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
