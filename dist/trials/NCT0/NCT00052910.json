Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells following surgery. It is not yet known which chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen is more effective in treating stomach or esophageal cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare two different chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stomach or esophageal cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From study enrollment until death from any cause; up to 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (5-FU/LV)","deltaMin":3.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (ECF)","deltaMin":3.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":535,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34149004"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":62,"n":272},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Leukocyte count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Anorexia"]}}
