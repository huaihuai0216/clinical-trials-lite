Recent study found that ticagrelor 90mg twice a day orally could significantly reduce the occurrence of clopidogrel resistance and adverse cardiovascular events. The previous studies have reported that half-dose ticagrelor had the similar inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation as the standard-dose ticagrelor, which was significantly stronger than that in the clopidogrel group. One-quarter standard-dose ticagrelor provided greater degree of platelet inhibition than standard dose clopidogrel in Chinese patients with stable CAD. But large-scale clinical trials are still needed to confirm the effects of low-dose ticagrelor on platelet function in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"ADP-induced Inhibition of Platelet Aggregation","timeFrame":"up to 5 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Clopidogrel 75mg Qdpo.","deltaMin":54.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ticagrelor 90mg Bidpo.","deltaMin":80.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ticagrelor 45mg Bidpo.","deltaMin":73.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ticagrelor 90mg Qdpo.","deltaMin":66,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1511},"commonTop":[]}}
