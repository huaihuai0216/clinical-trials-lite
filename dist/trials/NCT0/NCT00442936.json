This study was conducted as a \"triple-dummy\" design; for each dose of study drug, participants each received 3 forms of study drug (2 capsules of active and/or placebo and 1 tablet of active and/or placebo) and were instructed to take one of each form of study drug at dosing time.\n\nThe primary hypotheses of this study are that telcagepant is superior to placebo in Pain Freedom at 2 Hours Post-Dose, Pain Relief at 2 Hours Post-Dose, Absence of Photophobia at 2 Hours Post-Dose, Absence of Phonophobia at 2 Hours Post-Dose and Absence of Nausea at 2 Hours Post-Dose.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Pain Freedom (PF) at 2 Hours Post-Dose","timeFrame":"2 hours post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Telcagepant 150 mg","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Telcagepant 300 mg","deltaMin":89,"sd":null},{"arm":"Zolmitriptan 5 mg","deltaMin":101,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":29,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["19036425","21054362"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":334},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Dry mouth","Somnolence","Nausea","Fatigue"]}}
