Most people who have had a stem cell transplant are offered a vaccine called 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS) to help protect against this germ. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response in HSCT recipients who receive a 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine (13vPnC) followed by 23vPS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) for Serotype-specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Antibody From Before 13vPnC Dose 1 to 1 Month After 13vPnC Dose 3 in All Participants","timeFrame":"Before 13vPnC Dose 1 (pre-vaccination), 1 month after 13vPnC Dose 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC, 23vPS (All Participants)","deltaMin":17.96,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":47,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Netherlands","Poland","Spain","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25870329"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":58,"n":247},"commonTop":["Pain (Any)","Pain (Mild)","Fatigue (Any)","Muscle pain (Any)","Fatigue (Mild)"]}}
