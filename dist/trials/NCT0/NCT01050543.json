Study medication will be administered at reappearance of T2. Time to recovery will be measured from start of study medication administration to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio of 0.9. The primary hypothesis is that the time to recovery of the T4/T1 ratio of 0.9 is shorter with sugammadex than with neostigmine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time From Start of Study Drug Administration to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9","timeFrame":"From Start of Study Drug Administration to Recovery of the T4/T1 Ratio to 0.9 (estimated from 2 minutes up to ~15 minutes)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sugammadex","deltaMin":1.77,"sd":null},{"arm":"Neostigmine","deltaMin":14.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["24427455"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":60},"commonTop":["Procedural pain","Incision site pain","Headache","Wound complication","Nausea"]}}
