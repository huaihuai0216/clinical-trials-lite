The duration of this trial will be up to 67 weeks. This study will consist of a 1-week Screening Period, a 10-week wash-off period from metformin, if needed, and a 2-week placebo run-in period, a 52-week double-blind treatment period, and a 14-day post-treatment follow-up period. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the hemoglobin A1C (A1C)-lowering efficacy of the addition of ertugliflozin compared to the addition of placebo with an underlying hypothesis that addition of treatment with ertugliflozin provides greater reduction in A1C compared to the addition of placebo; the primary objective will be tested for both 5-mg and 15-mg doses of ertugliflozin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 26 - Excluding Rescue Approach","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 5 mg","deltaMin":-0.29,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 15 mg","deltaMin":-0.41,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.807"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.155"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["29159457","38770818","34213819","32648108","32372382","32324082","32324065","31797522"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":154},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Urinary tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
