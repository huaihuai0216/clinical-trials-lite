The dyslipidemia associated with T2D is characterized by elevated triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL). The ability of the insulin sensitizing agent pioglitazone (ACTOS®) , to improve hyperglycemia in subjects with T2D is now well established. Pioglitazone functions as a PPAR-γ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) agonists and this class of drugs have demonstrated several other potential benefits, beyond glucose homeostasis. Specifically pioglitazone can improve diabetic dyslipidemia by increasing HDL cholesterol and lowing triglycerides. A potential beneficial effect on reverse cholesterol transport may be mediated by the increased HDL levels. This proposal aims to examine the effect of PPAR-γ activation by PIO on various aspects of reverse cholesterol transport by testing the hypothesis that PIO treatment affects key steps in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway either directly, through induction of protein expression, or indirectly, by altering HDL structure and composition leading to increase cholesterol flux through this pathway.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Increased HDL-Cholesterol and Decreased Triglycerides","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pioglitazone Group","deltaMin":7.9,"sd":15.3},{"arm":"Comparator Group","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":9.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11160777","15055868","14553867","15739120","15632102"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":16},"commonTop":[]}}
