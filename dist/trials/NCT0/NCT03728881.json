Cervarix is a vaccine used to prevent cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18. Gardasil is vaccine used to prevent cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18 and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. Giving only one dose of the Cervarix vaccine in girls may work the same as 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccine in young women in preventing HPV infection and ultimately, cervical and other HPV-related cancers. Currently, many women around the world cannot get HPV vaccines because they are too expensive. If this trial can show one dose given to young girls is enough to prevent cancer, more girls might be able to get the vaccine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number Seropositive for HPV16 at 36 Months","timeFrame":"36 months following initial HPV vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Girls (1D Cervarix®)","deltaMin":538,"sd":null},{"arm":"Women (3D Gardasil-4®)","deltaMin":366,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Costa Rica"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40683285"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":620},"commonTop":["Influenza","Acute nasopharyngitis (common cold)","Urinary tract infection, site not specified","Viral infection","Pain in limb"]}}
