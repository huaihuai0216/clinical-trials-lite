The two treatments will be compared to see if there is any difference in patient outcomes. This will help guide treatment strategies for patients with CRS in the future.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Rhinosinusitis Disability Index (RSDI) Score","timeFrame":"Baseline and 14 days after treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Placebo With Nebulized Intranasal Levofloxacin","deltaMin":-8,"sd":29.47},{"arm":"Oral Antibiotics With Nebulized Intranasal Placebo","deltaMin":-14.82,"sd":13.49}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.505"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["epistaxis","bad taste","diarrhea","Fever","nausea/vomiting"]}}
