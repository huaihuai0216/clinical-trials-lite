More specifically, the investigators aim to assess the dose-response relationship for three different dosages of HCTZ.\n\nStudy intervention: HCTZ 12.5 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg once daily per os for 24 or 36 months. In addition, all patients in HCTZ treatment arms will receive state-of-the-art non-pharmacologic recommendations for stone prevention according to current guidelines.\n\nControl intervention: Placebo once daily per os for 24 to 36 months. In addition, all patients in the placebo arm will receive state-of-the-art non-pharmacologic recommendations for stone prevention according to current guidelines.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Stone Recurrences","timeFrame":"After 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":60,"sd":null},{"arm":"12.5 mg Hydrochlorothiazide","deltaMin":62,"sd":null},{"arm":"25.0 mg Hydrochlorothiazide","deltaMin":61,"sd":null},{"arm":"50.0 mg Hydrochlorothiazide","deltaMin":49,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36856614","39028573","30526528"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":102},"commonTop":["New onset diabetes mellitus"]}}
