Marizomib has been tested in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma in phase I and phase II studies. In patients with recurrent glioblastoma, marizomib was administered as a single agent or in combination with bevacizumab (NCT02330562). Based on encouraging observations, a phase I/II trial of marizomib in combination with Temozolomide+Radiotherapy(TMZ/RT) followed by Temozolomide (TMZ) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma has been launched (NCT02903069) which explores safety and tolerability of this triple combination and which shall help to determine the dose for further clinical trials in glioblastoma. In this context, given that marizomib has been established as a safe addition to the standard TMZ/RT --\\>TMZ, a phase III study is considered essential to establishing its impact on overall survival.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"From the date of randomization up to the date of death, assessed up to 49 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Arm","deltaMin":16.13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Arm","deltaMin":15.08,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":17,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":82,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Netherlands","Norway","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":114,"n":305},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Headache","Constipation","Vomiting"]}}
