It is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of neurocognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. A large MMSE score indicates a good cognitive functioning. The maximum MMSE score is 30 which corresponds to the best neurocognitive function and minimum MMSE score is 0 the worst neurocognitive function.The patient's neurocognitive function are considered 'impaired' if MMSE is 26 or less and 'normal' if it is 27 or more. MMSE has been validated and extensively used in both clinical practice and research. It is reported at week 16 during the Temozolomide (TMZ) maintenance phase. A negative difference indicates a worsening cognitive functioning. Difference range reported in the data table is min -19 and max 10. The mean difference is reported with 95% confidence interval (CI). A CI which excludes 0 indicates a significant mean MMSE score change.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.95","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.39","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":114,"n":305},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Headache","Constipation","Vomiting"]}}}
