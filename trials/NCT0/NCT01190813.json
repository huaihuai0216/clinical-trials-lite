Age 7 to 12\n2. Amblyopia associated with strabismus, anisometropia, or both\n\n   * Criteria for strabismus: One of the following criteria must be met: Heterotropia at distance and/or near fixation on examination (with or without spectacles); History of strabismus surgery; Documented history of strabismus which is no longer present (which in the judgment of the investigator could have caused amblyopia)\n   * Criteria for anisometropia: One of the following criteria must be met: ≥0.50 D difference between eyes in spherical equivalent; ≥1.50 D difference between eyes in astigmatism in any meridian\n3. Visual acuity, measured in each eye (amblyopic eye without cycloplegia) within 7 days prior to enrollment using the E-ETDRS protocol by a study certified visual acuity tester as follows:\n\n   * Visual acuity in the amblyopic eye 18 to 67 letters inclusive (20/50 to 20/400)\n   * Visual acuity in the fellow eye ≥78 letters (20/25 or better)\n4. Current amblyopia treatment (other than spectacles)\n\n   * 12 weeks of at least 2 hours of occlusion per day prescribed for the fellow eye during the immediate pre-enrollment period.\n   * While on current treatment, visual acuity has not improved one line (5 letters) or more since a non-study visit at least 6 weeks ago. Both acuity measurements to define no improvement must have been done using the same testing method.\n   * Treatment with atropine at any time during this pre-enrollment period is not allowed.\n   * Any treatment prior to the current patching episode with stable acuity is acceptable.\n5. Spectacle correction (if applicable) for measurement of enrollment visual acuity must meet the following criteria and be based on a cycloplegic refraction that is no more than 6 months old:\n\n   1. Requirements for spectacle correction:\n\n      * Spherical equivalent must be within 0.50 D of fully correcting the anisometropia.\n      * Hypermetropia of 3.00D or more must be corrected.\n      * Hypermetropia must not be under corrected by more than 1.50 D spherical equivalent, and reduction in plus sphere must be symmetric in the two eyes.\n      * Cylinder power in both eyes must be within 0.50 D of fully correcting the astigmatism.\n      * Cylinder axis in both eyes is within 6 degrees of the axis in the spectacles when cylinder power is ≥1.00 D.\n      * Myopia of amblyopic eye greater than 0.50 D by spherical equivalent must be corrected, and the glasses must not under correct the myopia by more than 0.25 D or overcorrect it by more than 0.50 D.\n   2. Spectacles meeting above criteria must be worn :until visual acuity in amblyopic eye is stable (defined as 2 consecutive visual acuity measurements by the same testing method at least 4 weeks apart with no improvement of one line (5 letters) or more.\n6. Eye examination within 6 months prior to enrollment\n7. Parent available for at least one year of follow-up, has access to phone), and willing to be contacted by clinical site and Jaeb Center staff\n8. In the investigator's judgment, the subject is likely to comply with prescribed treatment (e.g., no history of poor compliance with patching treatment) and unlikely to continue to improve by using 2 hours of patching per day alone.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Myopia more than -6.00 D (spherical equivalent) in either eye.\n2. Current vision therapy or orthoptics\n3. Ocular cause for reduced visual acuity\n\n   * nystagmus per se does not exclude the subject if the above visual acuity criteria are met\n4. Prior intraocular or refractive surgery\n5. History of narrow-angle glaucoma\n6. Bronchial asthma or severe pulmonary disease\n7. Strabismus surgery planned within 26 weeks\n8. Known allergy to levodopa or carbidopa\n9. History of dystonic reactions\n10. Current use of oral iron supplements including multivitamins containing iron during treatment with levodopa-carbidopa\n11. Current use of antihypertensive, anti-depressant medications, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone and isoniazid, non-specific monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or medication for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n12. Known liver disease\n13. History of melanoma\n14. Known psychological problems\n15. Known skin reactions to patch or bandage adhesives\n16. Prior levodopa treatment\n17. Treatment with topical ophthalmic atropine within the past 12 weeks\n18. A physician-prescribed diet high in protein\n19. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or intend to become pregnant within the next 34 weeks.\n\n    * A negative urine pregnancy test will be required for all females who have experienced menarche.\n    * Requirements regarding pregnancy testing prior to enrollment may be further defined by each individual Institutional Review Board.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"7 Years","maximumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Distribution of Amblyopic Eye Visual Acuity Change From Baseline","description":"The primary outcome is the amblyopic eye visual acuity letter score measured at the 18-week primary outcome visit following a rapid taper of study medicine beginning at week 16.
