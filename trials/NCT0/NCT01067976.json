If all 3 readers gave different categorical determination, the majority reader response was the most severe disease category given by any of the 3 readers, i.e. multifocal. For each participant, the mean of the confidence responses for the diagnosed breast regions was calculated, and rounded to the nearest 0.5. value respectively. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"90% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.42","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.83","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.32","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Blinded Readers: Inter-reader Agreement on Categorical Accuracy Based on Assessment for UMRM vs CMRM - Breast Region Level","description":"Inter-reader agreement was assessed by considering each breast region to have 2 possibilities (malignant disease / no malignant disease) for an assessment by the 2 image sets (UMRM and CMRM).
