Poor ovarian responders (PORs) involve 9-24% of patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF). proper tailoring of the ovarian stimulation protocol in order to maximize the number of oocytes collected represents a crucial step for them to eventually conceive.\n\nRecent evidence indicates that in the same menstrual cycle, there are multiple follicular recruitment waves. This coincides with the theory that folliculogenesis occurs in a wave-like fashion. Thus, within a single menstrual cycle, there can theoretically be multiple opportunities for a clinician to collect oocytes, as opposed to the conventional single cohort of antral follicles during the follicular phase.\n\nUtilizing this concept, clinicians have been attempting to retrieve oocytes from poor responders using both the follicular-phase stimulation (FPS) and the luteal-phase stimulation (LPS) protocols to increase the number of oocytes collected shorter within shorter period of time. By increasing the number of the retrieved oocytes collected, a better clinical can be assured since there is a clear relationship between the number of oocytes collected and live birth rates across all female age groups.\n\nwhich protocol is the most effective remains controversial and the efficacy of PPOS in POR compared with that of conventional protocols is unclear.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"the Number of M2 Oocytes Retrieved","timeFrame":"1-2 hours after oocyte retrieval","effectByArm":[{"arm":"the Progestin Primed Double Stimulation Group","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"the Flexible GnRh Antagonist Group","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.254"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Egypt"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23271957","25362088","26724797","22068695","23571519","25444501","26209449","29030068","27166216","21558332","26603821","6403567","25311972","25956370","21505041"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":41},"commonTop":["nausea and abdominal distention","pelvic pain","headache"]}}
