Radiographic disease progression was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 for soft tissue disease, or the appearance of two or more new bone lesions on bone scan. Progression at the first scheduled reassessment at Week 13 required a confirmatory scan 6 or more weeks later.
