The grace period was the first two weeks (i.e., days 1-14) with the remaining four weeks (days 15-42) comprising the period in which the participant must not meet criteria for treatment failure in order to be scored as obtaining prolonged abstinence. Self-report of cigarette use was assessed using a time-line follow-back (TLFB) assessment using carbon monoxide (CO)levels to correct self-reported smoking days. \"Smoking days\" were determined by starting with self-reported smoking and non-smoking days and using CO levels measured at weekly visits to modify the self-reports.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV(DSM-IV) ADHD Rating Scale","description":"A Generalized Estimating Equations(GEE)model which included treatment group, week, site, and treatment by week and site by week interaction effects was used to compare the groups on the DSM-IV ADHD total severity score (18 domains score at severity levels of 0\\[none\\]-3\\[severe\\]; maximum score 54) as measured at screening/baseline and study weeks 1-4 using the the interviewer-administered DSM-IV checklist and by the severity portion of the National Institute of Mental Health Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale to rate the severity of the participant's ADHD symptoms.
