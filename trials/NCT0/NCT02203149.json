The Clopper-Pearson method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the SVR12 rate. The lower limit of the 95% CI was compared to the reference rate of 75%; a lower CI limit that was higher than the reference rate would confirm the primary hypothesis and indicate that that the treatment combination was efficacious.
