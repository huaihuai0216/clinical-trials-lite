To be considered of non-childbearing potential, a female must be pre-menarche.\n* Participation in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned participation during the present trial period in another clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure.\n* Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the trial vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine prior to Visit 2 except for influenza vaccination, which might be received at least 2 weeks before or after the study investigational vaccines. This exception included monovalent, multivalent, live, and attenuated influenza vaccines.\n* Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine (ie., mono- or polyvalent, polysaccharide, or Conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, Y, W; or meningococcal B serogroup containing vaccine).\n* Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months.\n* Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).\n* History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically.\n* At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, participants with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or participants traveling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease).\n* Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances.\n* Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination by the Investigator's judgment.\n* Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Personal history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Personal history of an Arthus-like reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.\n* Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, was at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion.\n* Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator's judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥100.4°F). A prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition had resolved or the febrile event had subsided.\n* Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw.\n* Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"2 Years","maximumAge":"9 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Seroresponse Measured by Serum Bactericidal Assay Using Human Complement (hSBA) Against Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, Y, and W Following Vaccination With Either MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine or MENVEO® Vaccine","description":"Antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W were measured by hSBA.
