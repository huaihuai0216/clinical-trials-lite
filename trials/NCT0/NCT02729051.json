This is a phase IIIB, 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group multicenter study. This study will test the hypothesis that the difference in trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) between treatment groups is less than or equal to a pre-specified non-inferiority margin. Alternatively, this study will also test the hypothesis that the difference between treatment groups is greater than the margin. The triple therapy of FF/UMEC/VI in a single inhaler is being developed with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management of advanced Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Group D COPD which will reduce the exacerbation frequency, allow for a reduced burden of polypharmacy, convenience, and improve lung function, health related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established dual/monotherapies. This study has a 2 week run in period where subjects will continue to have their existing COPD medications. At randomization, subjects will discontinue all existing COPD medications and will be assigned to treatment of FF/UMEC/VI, 100 microgram (mcg)/62.5 mcg/25 mcg and placebo or FF/VI, 100 mcg/25 mcg and UMEC, 62.5 mcg in a 1:1 ratio for 24 weeks. Subjects will have clinical visits at Pre-Screening (Visit 0), Screening (Visit 1), Randomization (Week 0, Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 12 (Visit 4) and Week 24 (Visit 5). A follow-up visit will be conducted at 1 week after the end of treatment period or after early withdrawal visit. Approximately, 1020 subjects will be enrolled in this study. There will be two pharmacokinetic (PK) groups (subset A and subset B). Approximately 120 subjects will be assigned to subset A and approximately 60 subjects will be assigned to subset B. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 27 weeks, consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 24-week treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25","deltaMin":0.113,"sd":0.0112},{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 + UMEC 62.5","deltaMin":0.095,"sd":0.0116}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":127,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29370819","31321713"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":55,"n":527},"commonTop":["Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Influenza","Pharyngitis"]}}
