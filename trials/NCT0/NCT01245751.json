This information was compared to similar information obtained after Zoster Vaccine, Live administration to age-matched and younger participants who received their first dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live. The study was designed to determine: 1) whether a booster dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live in participants ≥70 years of age induces an antibody response that is noninferior to that of a first dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live in participants matched for age; 2) whether a booster dose of Zoster Vaccine, Live induces an acceptable rise in the level of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibodies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of the Antibody Responses to Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)","timeFrame":"Day 1 (Baseline) and Week 6 postvaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1: Booster Dose Participants ≥70 Years of Age","deltaMin":248,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2: First Dose Participants ≥70 Years of Age","deltaMin":254.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26452397","30165651"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":201},"commonTop":["Injection-site erythema","Injection-site pain","Injection-site swelling","Injection-site pruritus","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
