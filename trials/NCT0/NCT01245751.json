Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an adverse experience. A serious adverse experience is any AE that results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a cancer, is an overdose, or is another important medical event that may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention.
