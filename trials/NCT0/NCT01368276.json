Previously participated in protocol 005/05 (NCT00769704) and:\n\n   1. received the maximum number of talimogene laherparepvec treatment injections or cycles of GM-CSF allowable for that patient on study 005/05, or\n   2. new injectable lesion(s) appeared after previous resolution of all injectable disease while on study 005/05. New injectable lesions must have appeared within ≤ 12 months from the End of Treatment visit on the 005/05 study.\n2. In the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor's medical monitor further treatment is warranted \\[e.g., those patients who do not have clinically relevant progressive disease (PDr)\\].\n3. Performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, ECOG) 0 or 1.\n4. For patients randomized to talimogene laherparepvec only: Injectable disease (i.e. suitable for direct injection or through the use of ultrasound guidance) defined as at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous or nodal melanoma lesion. There is no minimum size for injection.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to talimogene laherparepvec of any organ system (with the exception of injection site reactions, fever and vomiting).\n2. History of Grade 3 fatigue lasting \\> 1 week while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment.\n3. History of Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgias while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment.\n4. History of ≥ Grade 2 autoimmune reactions, allergic reactions or urticaria or other talimogene laherparepvec related non-hematological toxicities while on talimogene laherparepvec treatment that required a dose delay or discontinuation of talimogene laherparepvec therapy.\n5. PDr while participating in study 005/05\n6. Patient requested to be withdrawn from study 005/05 or was unable to comply with the demands of the 005/05 trial.\n7. At the discretion of the investigator, patient was withdrawn from the 005/05 trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs)","description":"AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0 based on the following guideline:\n\nGrade 1: Mild AE; Grade 2: Moderate AE; Grade 3: Severe AE; Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5: Death related to AE.\n\nTreatment-related AE refers to AEs that have possible or probable relation to study treatment as determined by the investigator.\n\nA serious AE is one that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes:\n\n* Results in death.\n* Is life-threatening.\n* Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.\n* Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.\n* Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.\n* Is an important medical event.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Objective Response Rate","description":"Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator.
