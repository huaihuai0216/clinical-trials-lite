In this study, the investigators will examine the combination of standard cryosurgery treatment followed by a shortened course of topical fluorouracil cram. The investigators anticipate that a one week treatment course will maintain overall effectiveness when combined with previous cryosurgery, but will reduce the overall adverse effects of topical therapy due to the reduced treatment time and the presence of fewer baseline lesions to treat. This treatment approach may provide a more acceptable risk/benefit ratio option for patients with more extensive disease and simplify standard combination treatment options. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of combination cryosurgery and 5-fluorouracil0.5% cream, compared to combination cryosurgery and placebo in the treatment of actinic keratosis lesions. The efficacy of this combination therapy will be evaluated by assessing AK lesion clearance. The primary efficacy parameter will be 10% clearance of all AK lesions from treatment initiation to end-of-treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number Participants With 100% Clearance","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1 Carac (Fluorouracil) 0.5% Cream","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2 Placebo","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":["viral infection","basal cell carcinoma","joint pain","tooth pain"]}}
