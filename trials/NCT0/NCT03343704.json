OR\n  * Group B: A condition requiring emergency surgery or invasive procedure where adequate hemostasis is required. Emergency is defined as within the following 8 hours.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nGroup A:\n\n* Patients with minor bleeding (e.g. epistaxis, hematuria) who can be managed with standard supportive care.\n* Patients with no clinical signs of bleeding.\n* Contraindications to study medication including known hypersensitivity to the drug or its excipients (subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance may react to sorbitol).\n\nGroup B:\n\n* A surgery or procedure which is elective or where the risk of uncontrolled or unmanageable bleeding is low.\n* Contraindications to study medication including known hypersensitivity to the drug or its excipients (subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance may react to sorbitol).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Maximum Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect of Dabigatran Based on Central Laboratory Determination of Ecarin Clotting Time","description":"Maximum reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran based on central laboratory determination of ecarin clotting time is reported.\n\nThe maximum reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is defined for patients with at least one post-dose coagulation test results and pre-dose result higher than 100% Upper limit of normal (ULN).
