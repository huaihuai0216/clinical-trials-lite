Studies to determine the alteration in ovarian steroidogenesis that lead to abnormal production of ovarian androgens have revealed increased CYP17 gene expression with accentuated 17-hydroxylase activity leading to exaggerated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17P) responses to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. In contrast, T and A responses did not distinguish between PCOS and normal women, although these androgens were clearly greater in the former compared to the latter group. As a result, 17P responsiveness has been employed to determine the functional capacity of the ovary to produce androgens. The stimulatory agents that have been used included GnRH agonist, Lupron, at a dose of 10 microgram per kilogram, or hCG at a dose of 10,000 IU. The investigators propose to conduct a study that will determine the pattern of androgen responsiveness to 25ucg of hCG after 24 hours in adolescents with PCOS, those with oligomenorrhea, and in normal controls. This will allow for a comparison of these adolescents' ovarian functional capacity to produce androgens.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"17OHP Levels After hCG","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PCOS Group","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":0.5},{"arm":"Normal Group","deltaMin":1.3,"sd":0.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":14},"commonTop":[]}}
