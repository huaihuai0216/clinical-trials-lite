It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability. A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of dystrophinopathy in approximately 10-15 percent (%) of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. The main goal of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the effect of ataluren on walking ability. The effect of ataluren on physical function, quality of life, and activities of daily living will be evaluated. This study will also provide additional information on the long-term safety of ataluren.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in 6MWD at Week 48","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-60.67,"sd":9.323},{"arm":"Ataluren","deltaMin":-47.69,"sd":9.247}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.213"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Czechia","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Poland","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34693725","34383312","32851872","28728956"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ptcbio.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":115},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Fall","Cough"]}}
