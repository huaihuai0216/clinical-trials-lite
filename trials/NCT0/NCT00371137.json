Subjects with a \\>= 30% reduction in pain VAS from baseline to endpoint (week 14) were considered responders; all other subjects were considered non-responders. Missing data were handled using BOCF (Baseline Observation Carried Forward). The pain VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain). The pain VAS was collected morning, afternoon and evening. Baseline is the average value recorded for the measure during the week prior to the end-of-baseline visit. Endpoint is the average value recorded for the measure during the week prior to week 14.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"46.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"39.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"72.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"53.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"60.7","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":183},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Dizziness","Vomiting","Diarrhoea"]}}}
