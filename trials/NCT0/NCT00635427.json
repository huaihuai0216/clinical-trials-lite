The patient has completed study TKT032 or TKT034, or study HGT-GCB-039.\n2. Female patients of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception at all times during the study and must have negative results to a pregnancy test performed at the time of enrollment and as required throughout their participation in the study.\n3. Male patients must agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception at all times during the study and report a partner's pregnancy to the investigator.\n4. The patient, the patient's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) has provided written informed consent that has been approved by the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).\n5. The patient must be sufficiently cooperative to participate in this clinical study as judged by the Investigator\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The patient has received treatment with any non-Gaucher disease-related investigational drug or device within the 30 days prior to study entry; such use during the study is not permitted.\n2.
