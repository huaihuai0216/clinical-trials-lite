Overall, the investigators hypothesize that subclinical gut inflammation is an important predictor in therapy response and outcome. These data could provide better insights into the complex interactions between gut and joint inflammation and guide the physicians in the therapeutic approach.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients Achieving Sustained Clinical Remission","timeFrame":"Upon end of trial for individual patient, between 28 and 52 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: NSAIDs With Possible Step-up to Golimumab","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Belgium"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21684383","3875721","23139267"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":58},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Gastroenteritis","Otitis"]}}
