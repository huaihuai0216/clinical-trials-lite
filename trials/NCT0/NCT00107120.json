Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of citalopram. Both escitalopram and citalopram are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and are used to treat depression in adults. This study is designed to provide a systematic evaluation of the safety and efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of depressed pediatric patients, 12 to 17 years of age. Patients completing the study will be eligible to enter an open-label extension study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score","timeFrame":"Baseline to end of week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Escitalopram","deltaMin":-22.4,"sd":1.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-18.4,"sd":1.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.022"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19465881"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":155},"commonTop":["Headache","Inflicted Injury","Nausea","Pharyngitis","Insomnia"]}}
