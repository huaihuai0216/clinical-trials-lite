Participants who received a licensed/authorized vaccine were censored at the day after receiving the licensed/authorized vaccine.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.016","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.007","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.141","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.030","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.211","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.049","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.105","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.136","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.325","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.729","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Seroconverting to SARS-CoV-2 Viral Neutralizing Antibodies on Days 29, 43, 120 and 211","description":"Titers of viral neutralizing antibodies were determined by an activity assay.
