Exclude the possibility of pregnancy by:\n\n  * testing on site at the institution serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of SonoVue® administration,\n  * surgical history (e.g., tubal ligation or hysterectomy),\n  * post menopausal with a minimum 1 year without menses.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Sensitivity: Percentage of True Positive Lesions Among All Malignant Lesions Per Truth Standard","description":"Sensitivity of SonoVue-enhanced ultrasound (SonoVue CE-US) versus unenhanced ultrasound (UE-US) for characterization of malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs), using the diagnosis provided by each of the 3 off-site assessors (blinded to patient data) for the Intent-to-Diagnose (ITD) population.
