The objective of the open-label extension is to evaluate the extended safety and skin-irritation profile of topically administered oxybutynin gel.\n\nThe hypothesis is that topically administered oxybutynin gel will decrease (compared to placebo) the number of incontinence episodes per week, average daily urinary frequency, and urinary urgency; increase average urinary void volume; and improve patient quality of life.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Mean Weekly Frequency of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 12","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oxybutynin Gel 56 mg/Day","deltaMin":-24.8,"sd":28.7},{"arm":"Oxybutynin Gel 84 mg/Day","deltaMin":-21.9,"sd":25.1},{"arm":"Placebo Gel","deltaMin":-20,"sd":27}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":210},"commonTop":["Dry mouth","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Urinary tract infection","Application site erythema"]}}
