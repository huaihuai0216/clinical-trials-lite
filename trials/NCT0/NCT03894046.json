A confirmed diagnosis of a serious infection that will require treatment with IV antibiotics;\n2. A known infection caused by ABC (bacteremia, HABP, VABP, VP, cUTI or AP, or surgical or post-traumatic wound infections) as either a single pathogen or member of a polymicrobial infection based on evidence from culture or, if available, rapid diagnostic test from a sample collected within 72 hours prior to randomization (HABP/VABP/VP patients), AND 1 of the following:\n\n   1. Has received no more than 48 hrs of potentially effective (ie, Gram negative coverage) antimicrobial therapy prior to the first dose of study drug;\n   2. Is clinically failing prior treatment regimens\n3. APACHE II score 10 and 30 inclusive, or SOFA score between 7 and 11 inclusive, at time of diagnosis\n4. Expectation, in the judgment of the Investigator, that the patient will benefit from effective antibiotic therapy and appropriate supportive care for the anticipated duration of the study\n5. Women of childbearing potential (ie, not post-menopausal or surgically sterilized) must have a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test before randomization. Participating women of childbearing potential must be willing to consistently use one highly effective method of contraception (ie, condom, combined oral contraceptive, implant, injectable, indwelling intrauterine device, or a vasectomized partner) from Screening until at least 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug.\n\nPART B\n\n1\\. Has an infection (HABP, VABP, VP, bacteremia, cUTI, AP, or surgical or post-traumatic wound infections) caused by ABC organisms known to be resistant to colistin (defined as MIC ≥4 mg/L by a non-agar based method);\n\n1. Known to be resistant to colistin or polymyxin B; or\n2. Known intolerance to colistin; or\n3. Has myasthenia gravis or another neuromuscular syndrome(s) that contraindicates colistin and is not ventilated; or\n4. Has acute kidney injury and is receiving renal replacement therapy at study entry.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Evidence of active concurrent pneumonia requiring additional antimicrobial treatment\n2. Presence of suspected or confirmed deep seated bacterial infections such as bacterial Gram negative osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or meningitis requiring prolonged therapy, as determined by history and/or physical examination;\n3. Sustained shock with persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 60 mmHg;\n4. Pregnant or breastfeeding women;\n5. Receiving peritoneal dialysis;\n6. Requirement for continuing treatment with probenecid, methotrexate, ganciclovir, valproic acid, or divalproex sodium during the study;\n7. Evidence of significant hepatic disease or dysfunction, including known acute viral hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure, chronic ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy;","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Proportion of Patients With All-Cause Mortality in CRABC m-MITT Population","description":"The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is 28-day all-cause mortality in the CRABC m-MITT population in Part A.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Proportion of Patients With Nephrotoxicity","description":"The primary safety endpoint for the study is nephrotoxicity, as measured by the Risk-Injury-Failure-Loss-End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) criteria, in the MITT population in Part A.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":91},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Diarrhoea","Hypokalaemia","Pyrexia","Urinary tract infection"]}}}
