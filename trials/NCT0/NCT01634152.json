All patients' parent(s) (or legal guardian) must sign and date an informed consent prior to participation in the trial. In addition, an informed assent suitable for this age group has to be obtained from patients. A separate informed consent/assent is required for pharmacogenomic sampling.\n2. Male or female patients between 6 and 11 years of age.\n3. All patients must have at least a 6-month history of asthma.\n4. All patients must have been on maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid either at stable high dose in combination with another controller medication, OR at stable medium dose in combination with two other controller medications, for at least 4 weeks before Visit 1.\n5. All patients must be symptomatic (partly controlled) at Visit 1 and prior to randomisation at Visit 2 as defined by an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-IA) mean score \\>= 1.5.\n6. All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) \\>= 60% and \\<= 90% of predicted normal at Visit 1.\n7. Variation of absolute FEV1 values of Visit 1 (pre-bronchodilator, considered as 100%) as compared to Visit 2 (pre-dose) must be within ± 30%.\n8. All patients must confirm the diagnosis of asthma by bronchodilator reversibility at Visit 1, resulting in an increase in FEV1 of \\>= 12% 15 to 30 minutes after 200 mcg salbutamol/albuterol.\n9. Patients must be able to use the Respimat inhaler correctly.\n10. Patients must be able to perform all trial related procedures including technically acceptable pulmonary function tests and use of electronic diary/peak flow meter (diary compliance of at least 80% is required).\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nExclusion criteria are:\n\n1.

Patients who have been treated with systemic beta-adrenergics within four weeks prior to Visit 1.\n14. Patients who have been treated with oral beta-blocker medication within four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period.\n15. Patients who have been treated with inhaled long-acting anticholinergics or systemic anticholinergic treatment within four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period, or who have been treated with inhaled short-acting anticholinergics within two weeks prior to Visit 1.\n16. Patients who have been treated with short-acting theophylline preparations within two weeks prior to Visit 1.\n17. Patients who have been treated with non-approved and according to international guidelines not recommended experimental drugs for routine asthma therapy within four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period.\n18. Patients who have taken an investigational drug within six half lives according to the investigator's information, or four weeks (whichever is greater) prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period.\n19. Patients who have previously been randomised in this trial or are currently participating in another trial.\n20. Patients with any acute asthma exacerbation or respiratory tract infection in the four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or in the four weeks prior to Visit 2. In case of an asthma deterioration occurring in the four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or in the four weeks prior to Visit 2, the visit must be postponed.\n21. Patients requiring six or more puffs of rescue medication per day on more than two consecutive days in the four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or in the four weeks prior to Visit 2. In case of an asthma deterioration occurring in the four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or in the four weeks prior to Visit 2, the visit must be postponed.\n22. Patients who are unable to comply with medication restrictions prior to Visit 1 and/or prior to Visit 2.\n23. Patients with a known narrow-angle glaucoma, or any other disease where anticholinergic treatment is contraindicated.\n24.
