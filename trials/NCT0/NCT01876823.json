Although a number of theoretical causes exist, the etiology of AD is still unknown. Consequently, the focus of treatments has been palliative, designed to ameliorate AD symptoms. Recent efforts, however, have revealed some surprising data suggesting that cholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs), used over the last decade, and recently released memantine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist), may confer protection to neurons. Thus, they may offer a slowing of cognitive decline and/or improvement in behavioral symptoms associated with memory impairment.\n\nOver the last decade, it has been well documented that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases the risk of conversion to AD and that coincident depression and MCI (Dep-MCI) further increases the risk 2 to 3 fold. The primary focus of this line of investigation is to treat the very high risk to dement patient population with Dep-MCI, before they develop AD, in the hopes of delaying AD onset.\n\nMemantine had not been studied in DEP-MCI patients. Since treatment of these patients with combined antidepressant and AChEIs has been associated with cognitive improvement in pilot studies, we explore whether treatment of DEP-MCI with memantine in addition to antidepressant treatment would benefit cognitive performance and lead to a low rate of conversion to dementia. We evaluate the cognitive and antidepressant benefit of combined open-label es-citalopram and memantine treatment over 48 weeks in a DEP-CI sample.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Selective Reminding Test - Total Immediate Recall (SRT-IR)","timeFrame":"baseline, 48 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Es-citalopram and Memantine Treatment","deltaMin":7.5,"sd":15}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["8105707","18580597","18334761","22566581","9862549","16894105","7724692","12860770","16720794","19916207","18723162","12571820","8629893","19176895","22689908","17509485","17117395","17242334","17136705","12756140","10690971","18651723","16273995","12405546","19204022","19528519","18300306","16625572","15313849","11255443","20553766","16651510","20164594","18088076","16861375","10190820","15829527","18288936","19903364","12672860","21199965","11148233","22934752","15326237","17588275","12177369","18322263","16390905","26559790"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":35},"commonTop":["Sedation","Headache","Nausea"]}}
