The higher the score, the more intense the hypoglycemia symptoms. The sum of each symptom score would yield a range of 15 to 105 (i.e., 15 x 7 =105). The total score was calculated as the sum of each symptom score minus 15, and summarized at each time point by treatment group.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.0","spread":"7.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.8","spread":"7.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.8","spread":"8.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.3","spread":"5.2"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.9","spread":"4.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.5","spread":"3.9"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.8","spread":"3.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.0","spread":"3.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.9","spread":"3.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.1","spread":"2.9"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time From Glucagon Administration to Blood Glucose >/=70 mg/dL or an Increase ≥20 mg/dL in Blood Glucose From Nadir","description":"The mean time from glucagon administration to blood glucose \\>/=70 mg/dL or an increase ≥20 mg/dL in blood glucose from nadir.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t) of Baseline-Adjusted Glucagon","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1882.48","spread":"1216.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2521.87","spread":"971.07"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Maximum Change From Baseline Concentration (Cmax) of Glucagon","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3025.37","spread":"1981.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3553.43","spread":"1746.66"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Maximum Change From Baseline Concentration (Tmax) of Glucagon","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.33","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.25","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Area Under the Effect Concentration Time Curve (AUEC0-1.5) of Baseline-Adjusted Glucose From Time Zero up to 90 Minutes","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"106.39","spread":"42.60"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"124.47","spread":"38.95"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Maximum Change From Baseline Concentration (Cmax) of Glucose","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"114.80","spread":"47.45"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"130.72","spread":"44.15"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Maximum Change From Baseline Concentration (Tmax) of Glucose","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.5","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":77},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Vomiting","Fatigue","Nasal discomfort"]}}}
