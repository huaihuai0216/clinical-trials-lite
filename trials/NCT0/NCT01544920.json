Participants receive either peg-IFN + RBV (Arm 1) or BOC + peg-IFN + RBV (Arm 2). The hypothesis is that Arm 2 is noninferior to Arm 1 in the proportion of participants with undetectable HCV RNA at Follow-Up (FU) Week 24.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Undetectable Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) 24 Weeks After Completing Study Treatment (SVR24)","timeFrame":"Up to Week 74","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Peg-IFN + RBV","deltaMin":86.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: BOC + Peg-IFN + RBV","deltaMin":88.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":368},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Pyrexia","Fatigue","Headache","Neutropenia"]}}
