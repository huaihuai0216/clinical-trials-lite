Patients were monitored continuously on telemetry throughout the postoperative period until discharge. Electrocardiograms were obtained for any rhythm changes detected on telemetry monitoring, and in addition, electrocardiograms were performed preoperatively, at admission to the intensive care unit, and daily starting on postoperative day 1. All electrocardiograms and rhythm strips were reviewed in a blinded fashion by a single cardiac electrophysiologist.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"25.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Acute
