Family members,unrelated donors or banked umbilical cordblood units with similar tissue type can be used for HCT. This study will compare the effectiveness of two new types of bone marrow transplants in people with leukemia or lymphoma: one that uses bone marrow donated from family members with only partially matched bone marrow; and, one that uses two partially matched cord blood units.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Year 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"dUCB","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Haplo-BM","deltaMin":41.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4092"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.060"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24862638","24645687","37120135","37088401","34273598","33475736"],"seeAlso":["https://bethematch.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":186},"commonTop":["Myelodysplastic syndrome"]}}
