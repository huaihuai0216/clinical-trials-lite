Only patients with FGFR1 or 3 positive tumors can be randomized into the study. Archival tumor tissue is adequate for testing of FGFR1 and 3 mRNA expressions, which will be determined centrally using an RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) test. Approximately 42 % of UC patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC are identified as FGFR-positive by the RNA-ISH cut-off applied.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Objective Response Rate (ORR) - Central Assessment","timeFrame":"From start of treatment up to end of active follow-up, approximately 29 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rogaratinib (BAY1163877)_Overall Population","deltaMin":19.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy_Overall Population","deltaMin":21.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Rogaratinib_WT Population","deltaMin":19.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy_WT Population","deltaMin":23.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.6991"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"=0.7944"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":161,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Singapore","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36240478","30807645"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/","http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":39,"n":86},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Decreased appetite","Constipation","Fatigue","Nausea"]}}
