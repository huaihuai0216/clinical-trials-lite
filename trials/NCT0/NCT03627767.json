Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin \\[darker or lighter\\], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin \\[other than blood\\], and skin swelling). Participants had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.1","spread":"-4.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.2","spread":"-4.4"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.2","spread":"-4.4"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.1","spread":"1.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.8","spread":"0.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.1","spread":"-0.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":"2.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.0","spread":"0.8"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.1","spread":"-0.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":"1.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.0","spread":"0.8"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.3","spread":"0.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.9","spread":"1.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.2","spread":"0.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.2","spread":"0.0"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":1233},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dermatitis atopic","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}}
