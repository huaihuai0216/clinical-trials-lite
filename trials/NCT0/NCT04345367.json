The treatment duration is 26 weeks. A total of approximately 600 participants will be enrolled from approximately 220 sites globally. Approximately 600 participants will be randomly assigned to study intervention. There are primary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 4, and a key secondary efficacy assessment at Week 16. Efficacy and safety endpoints will be assessed throughout the entire study. Exploratory endpoints related to hand eczema efficacy will be assessed throughout the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Greater Than or Equal to (>=) 4 Points Improvement in Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS4) From Baseline at Week 2","timeFrame":"Week 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Abrocitinib 200 mg QD","deltaMin":48.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dupilumab 300 mg Q2W","deltaMin":25.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":151,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","Finland","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Latvia","Poland","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39903335","37254941","35871814"],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=B7451050"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":362},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Acne","Conjunctivitis","Dermatitis atopic"]}}
