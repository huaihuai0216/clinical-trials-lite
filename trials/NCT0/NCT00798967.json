Teduglutide is similar to a protein the body makes. When people have SBS, their bodies do not make enough of the protein and they have trouble getting nutrients and fluids from the food they eat and drink. This study was designed to provide evidence of efficacy, safety, and tolerability of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg daily in SBS subjects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Responder","timeFrame":"Weeks 20 and 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Teduglutide","deltaMin":27,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16099790","31784300","29174926","27507402","24134154","23587733","23274148","22982184"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":42},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain","Nausea","Central line systemic infections","Gastrointestinal stoma complication","Abdominal distension"]}}
