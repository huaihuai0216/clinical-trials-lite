administered corticosteroids at any time within 3 weeks before screening visit, the subject must have completed at least 3 weeks (21 days) of therapy at a stable and constant dose and schedule prior to screening visit\n* When administered azathioprine (immunosuppressant) at any time within 3 months before screening visit, the subject must have received a stable dose and schedule for at least 3 months prior to screening visit\n* When administered vinca alkaloids (eg., vincristine) at any time within 2 weeks before screening visit, the subject must have received a stable dose and schedule for at least 2 weeks prior to screening visit\n* When administered attenuated androgens (eg, danazol) at any time within 8 weeks before screening visit, the subject must have received a stable dose and schedule for at least 8 weeks prior to screening visit.\n* Females of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* History or clinical evidence of medical conditions (other than ITP) felt to be the underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia\n* Diagnosis of secondary immune thrombocytopenia\n* History of severe (eg, anaphylactic) reactions to blood or any blood- derived product\n* History of intolerance to any component of the IP, such as sorbitol\n* Suffering serious and/or life-threatening hemorrhage/bleeding defined as:\n* Any intracranial or central nervous system bleeding\n* Any hemorrhagic event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event\n* Females who are pregnant or nursing an infant child\n* Known to have immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency\n* Known to abuse alcohol, opiates, psychotropic agents or other chemicals or drugs, or has done so within 12 months of the screening visit\n* Documented diagnosis of thrombotic complications to polyclonal IVIG therapy in the past\n* Unstable or uncontrolled disease, or condition, related to, or impacting, cardiac function: unstable angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled arterial hypertension\n* Is anemic (hemoglobin \\< 9 g/dL)\n* Renal impairment (ie, serum creatinine \\> 1.5 x upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\])\n* Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels \\> 2.5 x ULN\n* Known to have a positive test for either HCV or HIV (HIV 1/2)\n* Splenectomy within the prior 8 weeks to the screening visit\n* currently receiving any treatment for ITP except corticosteroids, azathioprine, vinca alkaloids or danazol\n* Received an immune serum globulin (ISG) product within the prior 3 weeks (21 days) to the screening visit\n* Received any alkylating agent (eg, cyclophosphamide) within 5 weeks prior to the screening visit\n* Received rituximab within the prior 3 months to the screening visit\n* Was currently receiving, or received, any therapeutic drug or device that was not approved by a Regulatory Authority (US or Canadian) for any indication within the prior 12 weeks to the screening visit","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"3 Years","maximumAge":"70
