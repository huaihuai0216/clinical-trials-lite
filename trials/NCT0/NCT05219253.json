For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone equivalent ≥ 20 mg/day or equivalent is not allowed. Inhaled, intra-articular and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Previous vaccination against varicella or HZ.\n\nPrior/Concurrent clinical study experience Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the participant has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational intervention (drug/ invasive medical device).\n\nOther exclusions\n\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions within 2 months of last study intervention administration.\n* Indications of drug abuse or excess alcohol use as deemed by investigator to potentially confound safety assessments or render participant unable or unlikely to adhere to protocol requirements.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50
