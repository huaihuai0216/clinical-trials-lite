For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being \"none of the time\" unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 36.
