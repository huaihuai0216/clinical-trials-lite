A participant with a prior history of seizure may be considered for enrollment if the Investigator believes the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrollment.\n* All participants will be screened for syphilis.\n\n  * Participants with untreated secondary (late latent) or tertiary syphilis infection, defined as a positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and a positive treponemal test without clear documentation of treatment, are excluded.\n  * Participants with a false positive RPR (with negative treponemal test) or serofast RPR result (persistence of a reactive nontreponemal syphilis test despite history of adequate therapy and no evidence of re-exposure) may enroll after consultation with the Medical Monitor.\n  * Participants with primary syphilis or early latent secondary syphilis (acquired within the preceding year) who have a positive RPR test and have not been treated may be treated during the screening period and if completion of antibiotic treatment occurs during the screening period, may be allowed entry after consultation with the Medical Monitor.
