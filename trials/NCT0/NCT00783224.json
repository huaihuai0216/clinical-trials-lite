day\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a complication of tuberculous diseases or lower respiratory tract infections, and those with a complication of otorhinolaryngeal infections(acute upper respiratory tract inflammation, acute laryngopharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, etc.) requiring treatments judged by the investigator (subinvestigator) at the time of enrollment to randomization\n*

other serious complication, suffering from problems with systemic condition\n* Patients who have pollens as multiple allergens and the period from 7 days before enrollment to randomization to completion of the treatment period coincides with the period of scattering of relevant pollens\n* Patients with a complication of vasomotor rhinitis or eosinophilic rhinitis\n* Patients with a complication of a nasal disease (infectious sinusitis, hypertrophic rhinitis, acute or chronic rhinitis, nasal polyps, or septal deviation) which may interfere with efficacy evaluation of the study drugs\n* Patients with a complication of a disease (acute upper respiratory tract inflammation, acute laryngitis or acute tonsillitis, etc.) of severity affecting nasal symptoms within 7 days before enrollment\n* Patients who have previously received MF nasal spray\n* Patients who used FP nasal spray within 28 days before initiation of the pre-treatment observation period (7 days before enrollment to randomization)\n* Patients who have participated in clinical trials of other investigational product(s) within 120 days (4 months) before obtaining informed consent or participating at present\n* Patients in whom prior medication expected to be effective for allergic rhinitis was not drawn long enough before initiation of treatment with the investigational product or the preceding medication cannot be withdrawn\n* Patients who are being treated with specific desensitization therapy or nonspecific allassotherapy or in whom such the therapy was withdrawn within 90 days (3 months) before obtaining informed consent (except for patients receiving the maintenance therapy at present in whom the therapy began more than 180 days (6 months) before obtaining the informed consent)\n*
