Because of the likelihood for pathogenic IL-18 in certain monogenic diseases, patients known to harbor deleterious mutations in NLRC4-MAS or XIAP and who have a history of ongoing inflammation will be enrolled if they have ferritin ≥ 500 ng/mL or persistent C reactive protein (CRP) elevation ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and the patients should have a Modified Autoinflammatory Disease Activity Index (mAIDAI) ≥ 4.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Prevention of Flares","timeFrame":"16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Randomized Withdrawal - Placebo Arm","deltaMin":2.71,"sd":null},{"arm":"Randomized Withdrawal - Tadekinig Alfa Arm","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33128796"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ab2bio.com/en/home.8.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":14},"commonTop":["C-reactive protein increased","Injection site bruising","Injection site pain","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea"]}}
