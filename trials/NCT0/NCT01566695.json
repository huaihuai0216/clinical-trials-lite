The distribution of change in responses (i.e., improved \\[by ≥1 level\\], no change, worsened \\[by ≥1 level\\], and missing) from baseline are reported.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU): Number of Participants Who Were Hospitalized","description":"The number of reasons for hospitalizations and hospital admissions during the treatment period were monitored and include those associated with: AEs, protocol-driven procedures, transfusions, non-protocol procedures, elective procedures or those associated with social, practical or technical reasons in the absence of AEs.
