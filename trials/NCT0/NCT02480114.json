Radiation therapy to the head and neck may cause a burn involving the inside of the mouth, throat, and nasal passages, resulting in pain. Gabapentin may help prevent (or minimize) pain associated with radiation-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Pain Associated With Radiation-induced Mucositis, (Pain Subscale of the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey (VHNSS))","timeFrame":"Up to 3 months post-treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I Standard of Care","deltaMin":4.26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II Standard of Care Plus Gabapentin","deltaMin":3.68,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Fatigue"]}}
