No investigational products are permitted for use during the conduct of this study\n* Presence of any hypersensitivity to drugs similar to azelastine and to either sorbitol or sucralose (SplendaÂ® brand sweetener)\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing\n* Women of childbearing potential who are not abstinent or not practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception\n* Respiratory Tract Infections within 14 days prior to screening\n* Respiratory Tract Infections requiring antibiotic treatment 14 days prior to screening\n* Asthma (with the exception of mild, intermittent asthma). Subjects with mild, intermittent asthma who only require short-acting inhaled bronchodilators (not more often than twice per week) and who do not have nocturnal awakening as a result of asthma are eligible for enrollment\n* Significant pulmonary disease including COPD\n* Clinically significant arrhythmia or symptomatic cardiac conditions\n* A known history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years\n* Existence of any surgical or medical condition or physical or laboratory findings, which in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor's medical monitor, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug; that might significantly affect the subject's ability to complete this trial; or their safety in this trial.\n* Clinically relevant abnormal physical findings which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the objectives of the study or that may preclude compliance with the study procedures","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in 12-hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) (AM and PM Combined)at 14 Days","description":"reflective total nasal symptom score consisting of runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing was assessed twice daily.
