Basal luminal diameter of the entire coronary artery (mean luminal diameter) was measured for all subjects. Mean luminal diameter and luminal diameter approximately 4 mm distal to the tip of the Doppler wire were measured. The latter measurements were used to quantify volume flow as described previously. Data below are mean coronary artery diameter response following infusion of acetylcholine (ACh 10-5 M).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.1","spread":"0.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.7","spread":"0.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Coronary Blood Flow","description":"Measurement of diameter 4mm distal to the Doppler wire tip (measured using quantitative coronary angiography) and blood flow velocity, measured using intracoronary Doppler), were made at baseline and at peak velocity change.
