For patients with triglycerides \\<400 mg/dL, LDL-C was obtained using Friedewald's calculation; and for patients with triglycerides \\>=400 mg/dL, LDL-C was directly measured by the central laboratory using ultracentrifugation. Baseline was defined as the average of the screening and Study Day 1 (pre-treatment) assessments. An assessment was not included in this calculation if it was associated with a non-fasting blood draw or was drawn more than 4 weeks prior to Study Day 1. If the Study Day 1 and screening LDL-C values were \\>12% different (relative to the maximum value), then the screening value was not used, because the Study Day 1 value represents the best estimate of the patient's condition at the beginning of study drug administration.
