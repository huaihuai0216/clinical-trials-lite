symptomatic lower extremity atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease\n* Technically successful peripheral revascularization distal to the external iliac artery for symptomatic PAD (Peripheral artery disease) within the last 10 days prior to randomization\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients undergoing revascularization for asymptomatic PAD or mild claudication without functional limitation of the index leg.\n* Patients undergoing revascularization of the index leg to treat an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic restenosis of a bypass graft or target lesion restenosis.\n* Prior revascularization on the index leg within 10 days of the qualifying revascularization.\n* Planned dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) use for the qualifying revascularization procedure of clopidogrel in addition to Acetylic salicylic acid (ASA) for \\>6 months after the qualifying revascularization procedure; it is strongly recommended that any course of clopidogrel is kept to the minimum necessary in accordance with local standard of care and international practice guidelines (typically 30 days, or up to 60 days for some drug-coated products or devices) and is only allowed for up to 6 months for complex procedures or devices in the investigator's opinion that require longer use.\n* Planned use of any additional antiplatelet agent other than clopidogrel and ASA after the qualifying revascularization procedure.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50
