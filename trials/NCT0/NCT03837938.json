Inability to read or write; unwillingness to understand and follow the procedures of the study protocol; violation of the drug administration regimen or procedure execution that, at the discretion of the Investigator, can impact he results of the study or safety of the patient and interfere his further participation in the study; any other concomitant medical or serious mental conditions that make the patient unsuitable for participation in the clinical study, limit the validity of receiving an informed consent or may affect the patient's ability to participate in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Daytime Cough Resolution Rate by Day 8 in the PP Population","description":"Daytime cough (\\>08:00h up to 22:00 h) was evaluated on a 6-point scale (Six-point daytime and nighttime cough assessment scale\") where 0 = no cough during the day; and 5 = distressing cough most of the day.
