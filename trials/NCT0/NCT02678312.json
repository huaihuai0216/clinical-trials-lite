The purpose of Part 1 is to evaluate the way the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes and removes the drug LCZ696. This will help determine the proper dose of LCZ696 for Part 2 of the study.\n\nThe purpose for Part 2 is to compare the effectiveness and safety of LCZ696 with enalapril in a double-blind manner, in pediatric heart failure patients over 52 weeks of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part 1: Pharmacokinetics of LCZ696 Analytes (Sacubitril, LBQ657, and Valsartan): Maximum Drug Concentration in Plasma (Cmax)","timeFrame":"Age group 1: Pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, optional 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 of Period 1 and 2; Age groups 2 and 3: Pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 10, optional 24 hours post-dose on Day 1 of Period 1 and 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LCZ696: 0.8 mg/kg (Age Group 1)","deltaMin":523,"sd":390},{"arm":"LCZ696: 0.8 mg/kg (Age Group 2)","deltaMin":179,"sd":97},{"arm":"LCZ696: 3.1 mg/kg (Age Group 1)","deltaMin":1970,"sd":1666},{"arm":"LCZ696: 3.1 mg/kg (Age Group 2)","deltaMin":549,"sd":298},{"arm":"LCZ696: 0.4 mg/kg (Age Group 3)","deltaMin":124,"sd":80},{"arm":"LCZ696: 1.6 mg/kg (Age Group 3)","deltaMin":433,"sd":181}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Month","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":98,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Croatia","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Japan","Jordan","Lebanon","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Saudi Arabia","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39319469","36601956"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":17},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Upper respiratory tract infection","Cough","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea"]}}
