The PGI-S asks the participant to choose one response that best describes how his/her heart failure symptoms, specifically: shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling are now on a 5-point scale, ranging from 'Not at all' (1) to 'Very severe' (5). C1 = none (good), C2 = mild, C3 = moderate, C4 = severe, C5 = very severe (bad). Percentage of participants by change in score are reported. Participants with change from baseline were classified as improved (shifted from higher to score), unchanged (no change in score) or worsened (shifted from lower to higher score).","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27.01","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29.67","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"58.05","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"59.89","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.94","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.44","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30.90","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.46","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"55.62","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.85","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.92","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.33","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"38.01","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48.85","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48.54","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.82","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.45","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.33","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"33.94","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"49.38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"52.73","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.33","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35.53","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34.81","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48.03","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"47.47","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.45","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.72","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Part 1 and Part 2: Population PK of LCZ696 Analytes: Clearance From Plasma (CL)","description":"The analyses of CL was based on plasma concentrations of three sacubitril/valsartan analytes (AHU377 (sacubitril), LBQ657 (sacubitrilat), and valsartan).
