Diagnosis of spontaneous AMI based on the universal MI definition\\* with randomization to occur between 12 hours and 7 days after index event presentation. (\\*patients with spontaneous MI event determined to be secondary to another medical condition such as anemia, hypotension, or arrhythmia OR thought to be caused by coronary vasospasm with document normal coronary arteries are not eligible; patients with clinical presentation thought to be related to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are also not eligible)\n3. Evidence of LV systolic dysfunction and/or pulmonary congestion requiring intravenous treatment associated with the index MI event defined as:\n\n   * LVEF ≤40% after index MI presentation and prior to randomization and/or\n   * Pulmonary congestion requiring intravenous treatment with diuretics, vasodilators, vasopressors and/or inotropes, during the index hospitalization\n4. At least one of the following 8 risk factors:\n\n   * Age ≥ 70 years\n   * eGFR \\<60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 based on MDRD formula at screening visit\n   * Type I or II diabetes mellitus\n   * Documented history of prior MI\n   * Atrial fibrillation as noted by ECG, associated with index MI\n   * LVEF \\<30% associated with index MI\n   * Worst Killip class III or IV associated with index MI requiring intravenous treatment\n   * STEMI without reperfusion therapy within the first 24 hours after presentation\n5. Hemodynamically stable defined as:\n\n   * SBP ≥ 100 mmHg at randomization for patients who received ACEi/ARB during the last 24 hours prior to randomization\n   * SBP ≥ 110 mmHg at randomization for patients who did not receive ACEi/ARB during the last 24 hours prior to randomization\n   * No IV treatment with diuretics, vasodilators, vasopressors and/or inotropes during the 24 hours prior to randomization\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
