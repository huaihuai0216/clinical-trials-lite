Bone-related complications are a major cause of morbidity in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid may stop the growth of cancer cells in the bone and may help relieve some of the symptoms caused by bone metastases. It is not yet known whether giving zoledronic acid more or less frequently is more effective in treating patients with metastatic cancer that has spread to the bone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With at Least One Skeletal-related Event (SRE) Within 2 Years After Randomization","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Zoledronic Acid Every 4 Weeks)","deltaMin":67.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Zoledronic Acid Every 12 Weeks)","deltaMin":67.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<=.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":504,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28030702"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":96,"n":879},"commonTop":["Nausea","Constipation","Serum calcium decreased","Diarrhea","Vomiting"]}}
