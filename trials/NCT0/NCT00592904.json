Met and continues to meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria for the preceding PDN or PHN study and received study drug or placebo under double-blind conditions.\n2. Completed the preceding double-blind study End of Treatment (EOT) Visit no more than 12 weeks prior to Baseline (Visit 1) for the open-label study. The eligibility status of patients who do not enroll during this 12 week period will be evaluated on a case by case basis via discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor.\n3. Males and females â‰¥18 years of age. Female patients should be either of nonchildbearing potential as a result of surgery or menopause (1 year after onset), or of childbearing potential and practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g., abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or intrauterine device \\[IUD\\]) for at least 1 month before the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and for 1 month after the end of the study (Visit 16). They must also have a negative pregnancy test at Baseline (Visit 1). Female patients using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional approved method of contraception (e.g., a barrier method plus spermicide or IUD) throughout the study.\n4.

Patients who discontinued early for any reason from the preceding double-blind study.\n2.
