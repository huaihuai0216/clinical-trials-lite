Subjects will receive 800 mg pazopanib once daily. The study treatment will continue until subjects experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The secondary objectives of the study are to assess response rate (defined as complete response or partial response), progression-free survival, and overall survival. Response rates will be collected per investigator assessment (no central review). Subjects will have a CT/MRI scan every 6 weeks until week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE)","timeFrame":"From Baseline to Follow-up (up to 6.230 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pazopanib 800 mg","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":58,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Chile","China","Czechia","Estonia","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","New Zealand","Pakistan","Poland","Russia","Slovakia","South Korea","Tunisia","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":80},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Hair colour changes","Hypertension","Decreased appetite","Nausea"]}}
