Diagnostic procedures, such as PET/MRI, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer, and reveal out how far the disease has spread. Radioactive drugs, such as 68Ga-PSMA-11, may bind to tumor cells that have specific receptors, and may allow doctors to see smaller tumors than the standard of care contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Detection of Prostate Cancer Metastasized to Lymph Nodes","timeFrame":"1 Day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI","deltaMin":19,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34406051"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":74},"commonTop":[]}}
