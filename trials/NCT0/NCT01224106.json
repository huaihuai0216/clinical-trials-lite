Participants will be randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either gantenerumab or placebo. Participants who consent to be part of the sub study will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess brain amyloid. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks in Part 1, with an option for an additional up to 2 years of treatment in Part 2, followed by an open-label extension (Part 3) until July 2020.\n\nThe dosing for Parts 1 and 2 was stopped after a planned futility interim analysis showed a low probability of meeting the primary outcome measure with the doses studied. The study has converted to open-label to investigate higher gantenerumab doses.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) Total Score at Week 104 (Double-Blind Treatment Phase)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 104","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo (Parts 1 and 2)","deltaMin":1.19,"sd":1.68},{"arm":"Gantenerumab 105 mg (Parts 1 and 2)","deltaMin":1.41,"sd":2.02},{"arm":"Gantenerumab 225 mg (Parts 1 and 2)","deltaMin":1.47,"sd":1.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.6744"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.4494"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":139,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39686620","31831056","29221491","22583155"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":55,"n":266},"commonTop":["Amyloid related imaging abnormality-microhaemorrhages and haemosiderin deposits","Injection site erythema","Headache","Fall","Amyloid related imaging abnormality-oedema/effusion"]}}
