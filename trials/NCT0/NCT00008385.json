It is not yet known if selenium is effective in preventing the growth of new tumors in patients with previously resected non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying selenium to see how well it works compared to a placebo in preventing the development of second primary lung tumors in patients who have undergone surgery to remove stage I non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence Rate of Second Primary Lung Tumor","timeFrame":"Assessed annually for 10 years after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Placebo)","deltaMin":1.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Selenium)","deltaMin":1.62,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.294"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":532,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":477},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nail changes"]}}
