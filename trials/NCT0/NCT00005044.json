Hormone therapy may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of hormone therapy and radiation therapy is more effective for prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of hormone therapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have prostate cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-specific Survival (DSS) (10-year Rates Reported)","timeFrame":"From randomization to 10 years.
