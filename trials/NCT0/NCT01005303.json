This study is designed to investigate if supplementation with micronutrients (including high-dose vitamin D) will improve the function of the heart in patients with heart failure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction","timeFrame":"Baseline, and 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":44.7,"sd":8.8},{"arm":"Micronutrient","deltaMin":38.9,"sd":11.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24952700"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":36},"commonTop":[]}}
