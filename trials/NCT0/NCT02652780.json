Each eye is assigned a score based on the contrast of the last group in which 2 or 3 letters were correctly read, ranging from 0 to 2.2 \"log of contrast sensitivity\" (LogCS) units. A score of 2.0 LogCS, represents a normal sensitivity contrast, and indicates the eye was able to detect 2 of the 3 letters with a contrast of 1 percent (contrast sensitivity = 100 percent or log 2).

Error scores were calculated according to the distance between any two caps. The error score for each individual cap was the sum of the difference between the number of that cap and the numbers of the cap adjacent to it, minus 2. TES was the total sum of the error scores of the entire set of caps.\n\nThe best possible score was 0 and there is no defined upper limit to the total error score range.
