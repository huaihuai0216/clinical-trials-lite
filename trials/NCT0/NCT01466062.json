Subject is receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy at the start of study drug administration, or\n   7. Subject is receiving systemic high dose corticosteroid therapy (prednisone equivalents 0.5 mg/kg or more every other day, other than inhaler or topical use) at the start of study drug administration, or\n   8. Subject is receiving other immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine, methotrexate, mizoribine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, cytokine inhibitors, etc.) at the start of study drug administration.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject who meets one of the palivizumab indications already approved in Japan.\n\n   * Subject born at 28 weeks of gestation or less and who is age of 12 months or less at the start of study drug administration.\n   * Subject born at 29 - 35 weeks of gestation and who is age of 6 months or less at the start of study drug administration.\n   * Subject is age of 24 months or less with a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia requiring medical management within the 6 months prior to the study drug administration.\n   * Subject is age of 24 months or less with a current hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease at the start of study drug administration.\n2. Subject requires oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure or other mechanical respiratory or cardiac support at Screening and at the start of study drug administration.\n3. Subject has a current active infection including respiratory syncytial virus infection at Screening and at the start of study drug administration.\n4. Subject has a serious concurrent medical condition (hepatic dysfunction, persistent seizure disorder, etc.) except those resulting in an immune deficiency condition or renal failure.\n5. Subject has received palivizumab prior to the study drug administration.\n6. Subject has received any other investigational agents in the past 3 months or 5 half lives prior to the investigational drug administration (whichever is longer).\n7. Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to constituents of the study drug.\n8. Subject has a history of serious adverse reactions or serious allergic reaction to immunoglobulin products or has a history of hypersensitivity to immunoglobulin products, blood products, or other foreign proteins.\n9. Subject whose remaining days of life are expected to be less than one year at the time of informed consent.\n10. It will be impossible to collect blood as scheduled from the subject.\n11. Subject is considered by the investigator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable candidate for the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"24 Months","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Serum Palivizumab Trough Concentrations at Day 1, Day 31, and Day 121","description":"Serum trough concentrations of palivizumab were assessed at Screening, at Day 31 (30 days after the 1st dose) and Day 121 (30 days after the 4th dose).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":"0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"59.0","spread":"12.9"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91.8","spread":"40.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Requiring Hospitalization For Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Required Treatment for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection","description":"Percentage of participants who required any of the investigated treatments (admission in the intensive care unit \\[ICU\\], oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure and other mechanical respiratory support) for disease caused by RSV infection after the initial dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Duration of Hospitalization Caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection","description":"Number of days of hospitalization caused by RSV infection.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Duration of Required Treatment for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection","description":"Duration (days) of requirement for any of the investigated treatments (admission in the intensive care unit \\[ICU\\], oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous positive airway pressure and other mechanical respiratory support) for disease caused by RSV infection after the initial dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Discontinuations Due to AEs","description":"An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment.
