A clinically useful reduction in pain is defined by either a 2-point reduction (on a 0-10 scale) in the worst pain experienced over a 24-hour period, or a ≥30% reduction in 24-hour opioid requirement. We will use a composite endpoint of reduction in pain without increase in 24-hr opioid requirement or no decrease in pain with a ≥30% reduction in 24-hour opioid requirement.Subjects will receive either lidocaine or placebo, followed at least 1 week later by the alternate agent.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Reduction in Worst Pain Intensity or Reduction in 24hr Opioid Dose of at Least 30% Without Worsening of Pain Scores","timeFrame":"7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lidocaine/Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (D5W)/Lidocaine","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":["Tingling","Headache","Dysphagia","Shortness of Breath","Dysgeusia"]}}
