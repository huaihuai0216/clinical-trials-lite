In addition, these infants within 2 hours of birth, had a special pulse oximeter placed to continuously monitor their oxygen saturation in two different target ranges (85-89% or 91-95%). This study helped determine whether or not these two management strategies affect chronic lung disease and survival of premature infants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Survival Without Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD)","timeFrame":"36 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CPAP","deltaMin":346,"sd":null},{"arm":"Surfactant","deltaMin":320,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"24 Weeks","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["2674614","20472937","20472939","20587676","22738947","22371462","25425651","27344218","24725582","23268664","37640232","35715492","30692613","30292492","28600154","28279433","25554820","24876196"],"seeAlso":["http://neonatal.rti.org/","https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches/ppb/Pages/projects.aspx"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":204,"n":318},"commonTop":["Nasal Breakdown","Any other non-serious adverse event"]}}
