For males, only those who can practice contraception during the study period are eligible.\n* ≥50kg in weight at the start of double-blind phase (Visit 2).\n* Inpatient or outpatient; however, the hospitalization status must remain unchanged during the double-blind phase. NOTE: Subjects may be hospitalized for ≤10 days after injection during the treatment period.\n* Written informed consent from the subject him/herself. If the subject's signature is not legible, the attendance of a witness is required.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria apply:\n* Bilateral hemiplegia or quadriplegia.\n* Presence of fixed contractures of the ankle (absence of range of motion).\n* Profound atrophy of the muscles to be injected.\n* Previous surgical intervention, phenol block, ethanol block, or Muscle Afferent Block (MAB) for ankle spasticity.\n* Casting of the study lower limb within 3 months prior to the start of double-blind phase (Visit 2).\n* Current treatment with intrathecal baclofen.\n* Use of peripheral muscle relaxants (dantrolene sodium, suxamethonium chloride, pancuronium bromide, vecuronium bromide, rocuronium bromide).\n* Concurrent use of antibiotics that interfere with neuromuscular transmission, such as aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g., streptomycin sulfate, kanamycin sulfate, gentamicin sulfate, neomycin sulphate, spectinomycin hydrochloride), polypeptide antibiotics (e.g., polymixin B sulfate), lincomycin antibiotics (e.g., lincomycin hydrochloride, clindamycin), and enviomycin sulfate.\n* Previous or current botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype.\n* Diagnosis of systemic neuromuscular disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).\n* Females who are pregnant, nursing, may be pregnant, or planning a pregnancy during the study period.\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any ingredient of study medication (e.g., human serum albumin).\n* Presence of psychiatric disorder or impairment of intellectual function that may interfere with the subject's ability to give informed consent or the conduct of the study.\n* Bedridden patients.\n* Presence of clinically unstable severe cardiovascular disease.\n* Presence of clinically significant severe renal or hepatic disease.\n* Infection or dermatological condition at the proposed injection sites.\n* Previous or planned participation in another clinical study (including the upper limb spasticity study of GSK1358820) within 6 months prior to the start of double-blind phase (Visit 2).\n* Others whom the investigator or sub investigator considers not eligible for the study.\n* Clinically significant severe reduction of muscle strength.\n* Angle closure glaucoma or its preposition (narrow angle).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Change From Baseline in Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) Ankle Score to the End of the DB Phase (Week 12)","description":"Change from baseline in MAS ankle score using a 6-point scale (0, 1, 1+ \\[regarded as 1.5\\], 2, 3, and 4; 0=no increase in muscle tone; 4=affected part\\[s\\] rigid in flexion/extension) to each time point in the DB phase was calculated.
