It contains 6 items covering overall work productivity (health), overall work productivity (symptom), impairment of regular activities (health), and impairment of regular activities (symptom). Scores are calculated as impairment percentages. The WPAI-RA yields four types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed), Presenteeism (impairment at work), Work productivity loss (overall work impairment), and Activity impairment.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.5","spread":"27.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.9","spread":"20.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.5","spread":"25.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.6","spread":"24.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.8","spread":"25.2"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.2","spread":"23.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.8","spread":"25.1"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.7","spread":"24.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11","spread":"23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-21","spread":"26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-16","spread":"24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11","spread":"22"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-23","spread":"27"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-22","spread":"26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-25","spread":"27"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-25","spread":"27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.4","spread":"24.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-21.6","spread":"28.0"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-14.0","spread":"25.6"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-9.0","spread":"24.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-22.1","spread":"30.2"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-21.4","spread":"27.2"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-24.4","spread":"30.1"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-24.6","spread":"29.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11","spread":"25"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-25","spread":"26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-20","spread":"25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-16","spread":"26"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-28","spread":"27"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-26","spread":"26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-30","spread":"27"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-28","spread":"27"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) and Bone Erosion Scores","description":"X-rays of the hands/wrists and feet were assessed for joint space narrowing (JSN) and bone erosions. Assessment of JSN for each hand (15 joints per hand) and foot (6 joints per foot), including subluxation, is scored from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating no (normal) JSN and 4 indicating complete loss of joint space, bony ankylosis or luxation. JSN scores ranged from 0-168. A score of 0 would indicate no change and higher scores represent a worsening of joint space narrowing.\n\nThe bone erosion score is a summary of erosion severity in 32 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet. Each joint is scored according to the surface area involved from 0 to 5 for hand joints and 0 to 10 for the foot joints, with 0 indicating no erosion and the highest score (5 for the hand and 10 for the foot) indicating extensive loss of bone from more than one half of the articulating bone. Erosion scores ranged from 0 (no erosion) to 280 (high erosion).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.27","spread":"1.15"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.10","spread":"0.74"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.09","spread":"0.52"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.56","spread":"2.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.18","spread":"1.02"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.17","spread":"1.00"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.57","spread":"1.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.25","spread":"1.12"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.20","spread":"1.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.15","spread":"3.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.42","spread":"1.91"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.34","spread":"2.00"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Population Pharmacokinetics (PK): Peak Concentration at Steady State (Cmax,ss) of Baricitinib","description":null,"paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"Geometric Coefficient of Variation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"143","spread":"19.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Population PK: Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve at a Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUCtau,ss) of Baricitinib","description":null,"paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"Geometric Coefficient of Variation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1220","spread":"45.8"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":488},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Bronchitis","Urinary tract infection","Pharyngitis"]}}}
