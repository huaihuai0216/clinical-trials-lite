Participants currently receiving intravenous epoetin alfa or beta or darbepoetin alfa will receive intravenous Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms/month (based on the erythropoietin stimulating agent \\[ESA\\] dose administered on week -1). Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range of 10 to12 gram per deciliter (g/dL). The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Mean Hemoglobin Concentration Within Plus or Minus (+/-) 1 Gram Per Deciliter (g/dL) of Reference and Within the Target Range","timeFrame":"Week 17 up to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"C.E.R.A.","deltaMin":60,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":60,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694","24052462"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":98,"n":351},"commonTop":["Hypertension"]}}
