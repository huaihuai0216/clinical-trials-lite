A moderation analysis will determine whether participants who reside in low- vs. high-need communities \\[defined by Community Need Index scores (i.e., an indicator of the built environment)\\] respond differently to treatment.\n\nPREVENT is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community. The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants' knowledge and skills to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is home-based intensive DM education. EUC matches PREVENT in treatment intensity (i.e., number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM self-care education, but does not include PREVENTS's other active elements (i.e., Behavioral Activation and telehealth). The treatment comparison will identify PREVENTS's specific efficacy over and above EUC. We hypothesize that PREVENT will halve the rate of incident DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC. The three secondary outcomes are: 1) subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.e., objective indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Incident Diabetes-related ED Visits and/or Hospitalizations","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PREVENT (Preventing and Reducing Emergency Visits in Diabetes Through Education and Telehealth)","deltaMin":0.88,"sd":null},{"arm":"EUC (Enhanced Usual Care)","deltaMin":1.29,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".12"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":78},"commonTop":[]}}
