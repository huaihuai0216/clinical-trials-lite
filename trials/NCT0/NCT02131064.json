The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine + pertuzumab (experimental arm; T-DM1 + P) versus chemotherapy, trastuzumab + pertuzumab (control arm; TCH + P). The study comprised a neoadjuvant treatment period, followed by surgery, and an adjuvant treatment period.\n\nTreatment can be stopped due to disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Total Pathological Complete Response (tpCR) Assessed Based on Tumor Samples","timeFrame":"Pre-surgery (within 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy; up to approximately 6 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TCH + P","deltaMin":56.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"T-DM1 + P","deltaMin":44.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0126"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":79,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36631725","31157583","29175149"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":70,"n":219},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Alopecia","Fatigue","Anaemia"]}}
