There will be a data collection period of at least five days to obtain baseline data on use of combustible cigarettes. Participants enrolled in the study will receive a G6 e-cigarette at V2 for ad libitum use. After the first week of e-cigarette use, (at V3) participants will be given zonisamide (100 mg/daily) and will begin extended-release bupropion dosing (150 mg each morning days 1-3, then 300 mg/daily) in addition to continued use of the G6. At each visit, participants will receive enough zonisamide, bupropion, and Halo G6 cartomizers to last until their next study visit. Halo G6 and combination zonisamide and bupropion use will continue until the participant returns for the End-of-Study visit (V7).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants That Completely Switched From Combustible Cigarettes to Halo G6 E-Cigarettes","timeFrame":"Weeks 8-11 post-quit date (weeks 10-13 post baseline)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Combination Zonisamide and Bupropion With E-cigarette","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":["Constipation","Headache","Throat irritation","Nausea","Cough"]}}
