In addition the tolerability of CG5503 PR will be assessed. One third of the patients will receive CG5503 and one third will receive placebo. For further comparison one third of the patients will receive oxycodone controlled release (CR) at doses of 20-50 mg twice daily which is an active approved pain medication. Please note that tapentadol ER (Extended Release) and tapentadol PR (Prolonged Release) are identical and used interchangeably. This is due to United States of America and European naming conventions.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline of the Average Pain Intensity Overall in the 12-week Maintenance Period of the Daily Pain Intensity on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).","timeFrame":"Change from baseline over the 12 week Maintenance Period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Matching","deltaMin":-2.2,"sd":2.06},{"arm":"Tapentadol ER","deltaMin":-2.5,"sd":2.18},{"arm":"Oxycodone CR","deltaMin":-2.1,"sd":2.17}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":100,"countries":["Austria","Croatia","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Latvia","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Slovakia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24985410","24916058","24353047","23709304","23340531"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":337},"commonTop":["Nausea","Constipation","Dizziness","Vomiting","Somnolence"]}}
