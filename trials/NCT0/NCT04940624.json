A placebo looks just like soticlestat but will not have any medicine in it.\n\nParticipants may continue treatment in an extension study, based on the extension study's entry criteria. Those that want to stop treatment will have a gradual dose reduction during 1 week and then be followed up for 2 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Convulsive Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days During the Full Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Baseline; Full Treatment Period: Weeks 1 to 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-8.64,"sd":null},{"arm":"Soticlestat","deltaMin":-22.16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.061"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":66,"countries":["United States","Australia","Brazil","Canada","China","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/60e40858ef0b71001e743e10"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":71},"commonTop":["Change in seizure presentation","Nasopharyngitis","Somnolence","Pyrexia","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
