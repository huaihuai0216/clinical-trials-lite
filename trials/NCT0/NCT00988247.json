The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required treatment (either continuous or intermittent) in the past, and in the investigator's judgment is expected to require treatment throughout the entire study\n* A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR through a standard skin prick test. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the diluent control wheal for the skin prick test. Documentation of a positive result 12 months prior to Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable\n* Other criteria apply\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent nasal biopsy, nasal trauma, including nasal piercing, or surgery and atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa (all within the last 60 days prior to Screening Visit \\[SV\\])\n* Participation in any investigational drug study within the 30 days preceding the Screening Visit (SV) or planned participation in another investigational drug study at any time during this study\n* History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, or influenza within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit (SV) or development of a respiratory infection during the Run-In Period\n* Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or routine use of β-agonists and any controller drugs (e.g., theophylline, leukotriene antagonists). History of intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of inhaled short acting beta-agonists prior to the Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable.\n* Other criteria apply\n\nRandomization Criteria\n\n* Subject continues to be in general good health, meeting the selection criteria\n* Subject has a minimum subject-reported reflective TNSS of an average of 5 (out of a possible 12) on the last 7 days during the Run-In Period\n* The subject-reported scores for rhinorrhea or nasal congestion must be an average of 2 or greater during the last 7 days of the Run-In Period\n* Each subject must have adequately completed the electronic AR Assessment Diary (failure is defined as missing the diary entry on more than 2 calendar days during the last 7 days of the Run-In Period)\n* Other criteria apply","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Average Subject-Assessed 24-Hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) up to 30 Weeks","description":"Participants recorded the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) in the past 24-hours (prior to the assessment) daily using the following scale:\n\n0=absent (no sign/symptom); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities).\n\nThe total nasal symptom score (sum of 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms).
