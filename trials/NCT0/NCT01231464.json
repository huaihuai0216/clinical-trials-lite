There are 3 phases, 2 to14 day run in, 2 week treatment, and 3 to 5 day follow up. After run in period, at least 360 subjects with AR ( ages of 12yrs and 65yrs, inclusive) will be randomised to receive FFNS 110ug once daily or placebo for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline of reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) during treatment period, and the secondary endpoints include mean change from baseline in nasal finding scores by rhinoscopy at completion of study treatment, and severity of overall inference in activities of daily living. Safety measures include AE (Adverse Event) reports, ECGs (Electrocardiograph), physical exams, vital signs, and nasal exam. In addition, reflective total ocular symptom score (rTOSS) will be measured as an explorative endpoint, only in the specific AR (Allergic Rhinitis) patients with severe ocular symptoms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline Over the Entire Treatment Period in the Daily Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)","timeFrame":"Baseline through entire treatment period (Day 1 through Day 14)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FFNS 110 mcg","deltaMin":-4.226,"sd":0.1646},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.728,"sd":0.1656}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21888757"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":181},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Epistaxis","Oropharyngeal pain"]}}
