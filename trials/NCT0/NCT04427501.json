LY3819253 and LY3832479 will be given to participants with early symptoms of COVID-19. Samples will be taken from the back of the nose to determine how much virus is in the body at various times during the study. Participation could last about 12 weeks and includes one required visit to the study site, with the remainder of assessments performed in the home or by phone.\n\nPediatric participants, with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, will enroll in a single-arm (Arm 22), open-label addendum to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of LY3819253 and LY3832479. Enrollment began on March 31, 2021, and completed on September 24, 2021.\n\nPediatric participants, with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness, will enroll in a single-arm (Arm 23), open-label addendum to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of LY3853113. Enrollment began on August 19, 2022, and completed on February 21, 2023.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Phase 3: Percentage of Participants Who Experience COVID-Related Hospitalization or Death From Any Cause in 2800 mg Bamlanivumab/2800 mg Etesevimab, 700 mg Bamlanivimab/1400mg Etesevimab and Their Placebo Groups","timeFrame":"Baseline through Day 29","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phase 3: Placebo For 2800 mg Bamlanivimab + 2800 mg Etesevimab","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 3: 2800 mg Bamlanivimab + 2800 mg Etesevimab","deltaMin":2.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 3: Placebo For 700 mg Bamlanivimab + 1400 mg Etesevimab","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase 3: 700 mg Bamlanivimab + 1400 mg Etesevimab","deltaMin":0.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"0 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":39,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39230829","37329415","35713300","35493124","34718468","34473343","34374951","34346827","34260849","33475701","33113295"],"seeAlso":["https://trials.lillytrialguide.com/en-US/trial/63aASRmBPQCBCOfy5oO0er"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":156},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dizziness","Rash","Diarrhoea","Vomiting"]}}
