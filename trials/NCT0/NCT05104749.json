The researchers hope to achieve this goal by conducting a clinical trial that is scientifically rigorous and clinically relevant. Expected results of this pilot study will be to obtain sufficient experience and preliminary feasibility data to justify a larger clinical trial of this hypothesis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Homeopathic Treatment Group","deltaMin":32.9,"sd":7.6},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":31.4,"sd":7.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Urinary Tract Infection","Vertigo","Rash","Musculoskeletal Pain"]}}
