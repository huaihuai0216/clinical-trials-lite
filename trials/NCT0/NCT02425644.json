Confirmed relapse: increase from baseline at least 0.5 point Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or increase of one point in one, two or three Functional Systems (FS), excluding bowel/bladder and cerebral/mental FS. EDSS and FS scores are based on neurological examination for assessing its impairment in MS. Among eight FS, seven are ordinal clinical rating scales ranging from 0-5 or 6 with higher scale indicates overall functional impairment assessing Visual,Brain Stem,Pyramidal,Cerebellar,Sensory, Bowel/Bladder and Cerebral functions. Rating individual FS scores is used to rate EDSS in conjunction with observations and information concerning gait and use of assistance. EDSS is ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10(death due to MS).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.202","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.290","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Fatigue-related Symptoms as Measured by the Symptoms Domain of the Fatigue Symptom and Impact Questionnaire-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (FSIQ-RMS) Score to Week 108","description":"The FSIQ-RMS is a 20-item Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) measure to evaluate fatigue-related symptoms and the impacts of those symptoms on the lives of people. The FSIQ-RMS symptom domain (FSIQ-RMS-S) consists of seven items assessing fatigue-related symptoms daily with a recall period of 24 hours measured on an 11-point numeric rating scale; the (normalized) symptom domain score ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating greater fatigue. This domain was completed on 7 consecutive days. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in fatigue symptoms.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.01","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.56","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Cumulative Number of Combined Unique Active Lesions (CUAL) Per Year From Baseline to Week 108","description":"CUALs was calculated as sum of new Gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+) T1 lesions plus new or enlarging T2 lesions (without double-counting of lesions) from baseline based on the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans up to Week 108.
