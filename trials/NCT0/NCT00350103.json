Two dose-escalation schemes for lacosamide will be used to further determine the efficacy of the \"standard\" scheme and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a more rapid titration scheme. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Subjects in two of the groups will receive lacosamide at a dose of 400mg/day, but different dose-escalation schemes will be used to reach this final dose. The third group of subjects will receive a placebo. Subjects will have a 2 in 3 (66 %) chance of getting lacosamide.\n\nThe maximum lacosamide dose in this trial will be 400mg/day. The maximum treatment duration will be 18 weeks, including a two-week Pre-Treatment Phase and a 12 weeks period on a stable dose of lacosamide or placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Average Daily Pain Score From Baseline Week to the Last 4 Weeks of the Maintenance Phase","timeFrame":"Last 4 weeks of Maintenance Phase, compared to the Baseline Week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":2.2},{"arm":"Lacosamide FT","deltaMin":-2.2,"sd":2.05},{"arm":"Lacosamide ST","deltaMin":-2.4,"sd":2.08}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"=0.0410"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.2902"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29588972"],"seeAlso":["https://www.ucb.com/website/_up/ucb_com_patients/documents/SP874_CSS_20080610.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/default.htm"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":179},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dizziness","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Vertigo"]}}
