In the first part of the study, half of CKD participants will be randomly assigned to ticagrelor and aspirin, while the other half will be assigned to clopidogrel and aspirin in a blinded fashion. The treatment duration will be two weeks. After recruiting CKD participants the investigator will recruit controls with normal kidney function that will receive only ticagrelor and aspirin for two weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"ADP Induced Platelet Aggregation","timeFrame":"2 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CKD-Ticagrelor","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"CKD-Clopidogrel","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control-ticagrelor","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.002"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.18"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36682595","35224730"],"seeAlso":["https://kidney360.asnjournals.org/content/early/2022/10/26/KID.0005532022"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":25},"commonTop":["Bruise","Dyspnea","Fatigue","Acidity"]}}
