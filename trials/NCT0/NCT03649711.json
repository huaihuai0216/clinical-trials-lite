Males and females, aged 18-91 years\n2. Ability to understand and sign informed consent after the nature of the study has been fully explained\n3. CKD participants: Non-dialysis CKD patients: Presence of CKD with an estimated GFR of \\<30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for a period of ≥3 months, as defined by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) and determined with the CKD-EPI creatinine-based formula\n4. Controls with normal kidney function: participants with an estimated GFR \\>90 mL/min/1.73 m2 as determined by the CKD-EPI creatinine-based formula and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio \\<30 mg/g as defined by the National Kidney Foundation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No healthcare power of attorney to sign informed consent\n* Unwillingness or inability to participate in the protocol or comply with any of its components.\n* Subjects unable or unwilling to stop taking:\n\n  * Aspirin and other antithrombotic agents, like cilostazol, ranolazine, aggrenox, prasugrel, warfarin, xarelto, pradaxa, eliquis.\n  * Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist (abciximab-ReoPro, eptifibatide-Integrilin, tirofiban-Aggrastal)\n  * NSAIDs and PPIs\n  * Fish oil, Vitamin E and herbal supplements\n* Acute kidney injury superimposed on CKD\n* Kidney transplant or any other solid organ transplant recipient\n* End-stage kidney disease on maintenance dialysis (peritoneal or hemodialysis)\n* Nephrotic syndrome defined as nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and generalized edema\n* Recent hospitalization or surgery \\<3 months\n* Acute coronary or cerebrovascular event in the last 12 months\n* Blood dyscrasias, active bleeding, or bleeding diathesis\n* Gastrointestinal bleeding in the last 6 months\n* Recent treatment (\\<30 days) with a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist (Integrelin).\n* Hematocrit \\<25%, white blood cell count \\>20,000/μL, or platelet count \\<50,000/μL\n* Any active malignancy or liver disease.\n* Pregnancy\n* Positive urine pregnancy test in a woman of childbearing potential prior to study entry. A female of childbearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria:\n\n  * Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or\n  * Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).\n* Patients must not be nursing due to the potential for congenital abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"91 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"ADP Induced Platelet Aggregation","description":"We will use summary statistics to describe the distribution of the data.
