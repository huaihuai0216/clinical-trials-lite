Subjects whose risk of aspiration are judged by the Investigator to be satisfactorily controlled by placement of PEG tube or G-tube for nutritional support are eligible to participate.\n* Respiratory forced vital capacity (FVC) of \\<20% of predicted\n* Prior botulinum toxin type A or B treatment in the salivary gland(s) identified for treatment in this study within 24 weeks before screening. Prior botulinum toxin type A or B treatment into other anatomical regions not selected for treatment in this study is not exclusionary, but must have occurred at least 12 weeks before screening\n* Subjects should be excluded if, in the Investigator's opinion, the subject failed to respond to previous treatment with botulinum toxin. Subjects should not receive nor have any plans for receiving any botulinum toxin treatment, other than the study drug (MYOBLOC), during the entire course of the study (from the point the informed consent is signed until subject's participation is complete).\n* Concomitant use, or exposure within 5 half-lives of screening, of aminoglycoside antibiotics, curare-like agents, or other agents that interfere with neuromuscular function\n* Prior salivary gland surgery\n* Current treatment or treatment at any time during the study with Coumadin® (warfarin) or similar anti-coagulant medications. Anti-platelet medications are not specifically exclusionary\n* Evidence of any clinically significant neurologic disease\n* Pregnancy or lactation\n* Anticipated or scheduled surgery during the study period. A PEG tube/G tube may be placed for nutritional support at any time during the study and will not exclude the subject from continued study participation.\n* Major surgery (requiring general anesthesia, except PEG tube/G tube placement ) within the previous 6 months before screening.\n* Current infection at the sialorrhea treatment injection site(s)\n* History of drug or alcohol abuse currently or within the previous 6 months\n* Participation in another clinical drug, device, or biological agent study within 30 days of screening or while participating in this study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Occurrence, Seriousness, Severity, and Causality Assessment of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)","description":"TEAEs Related to Study Medication include TEAEs classified as Possibly, Probably and Definitely Related.\n\nTreatment Session (TS)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"42","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Occurrence of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)","description":"Treatment Session (TS)\n\nAESI includes: Aspiration, Aspirational pneumonia, Choking and Dysphagia.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C-SSRS): Suicidal Ideation, Behavior Scores and Intensity Scores","description":"Participants Analyzed does not match the Participant Flow because one participant discontinued prior to the first post-injection visit.\n\nPer protocol participants were only required to complete two treatment sessions with a maximum of 4 treatment sessions allowed.\n\nAll subjects received 3500 U doses except for 13 subjects who had decreased doses at Treatment Session 2 and/or 3 (2500 U to 3000 U).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG007","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG008","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG007","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG008","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Occurrence of Dental Adverse Events","description":"Treatment Session (TS)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Unstimulated Salivary Flow Rate (USFR): Treatment Sessions 1-4","description":"For Treatment Sessions 2-4, the change from baseline is calculated using the Week 13 value from the previous Treatment Session as the new baseline.
