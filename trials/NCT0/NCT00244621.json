Subjects who have received a renal transplant \\> 6 months prior to study entry may participate in the study if: 1) renal function is stable, 2) estimated GFR \\>50 mL/min/1.73m 2, 3) stable doses of immunosuppressive medications are anticipated throughout the 4-week, double-blind period of the study, 4) no episodes of acute allograft rejection have occurred within 30 days of study entry, and 5) the renal allograft has no documented renal artery stenosis.\n\nNephrotic syndrome not in remission.\n\n* Unstable insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.\n* Known bleeding, coagulation, or platelet disorder that could interfere with blood sampling.\n* Clinically significant valvular heart disease.\n* Clinical diagnosis of heart failure.\n* Clinically significant arrhythmia (eg, any arrhythmia requiring medical therapy or that causes symptoms).\n* Second or third degree AV block.\n* Impaired liver function defined as either acute liver disease or chronic liver disease with persistent liver enzyme values greater than 1Â½ times the upper limit of the reference range for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT).\n* Known hypersensitivity to ARBs.\n* Currently receiving an angiotensin receptor blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that in the investigator's judgment cannot safely be withdrawn during the study.\n* Subjects receiving an angiotensin receptor blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may be eligible if they undergo withdrawal of the antihypertensive medication over a 2-week washout period and subsequently meet BP inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n* Subjects currently receiving other classes of antihypertensive medications (eg, diuretics, calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers) and whose BP values meet inclusion/exclusion criteria may participate in the study while continuing their current antihypertensive medication regimen. Up to 2 concomitant antihypertensive medications are permitted. Doses and dose regimens of concomitant antihypertensive medications must remain unchanged during the 4-week double-blind period of the study.\n* Currently using, or used within 14 days prior to receiving double-blind medication, any concomitant medications which in the opinion of the investigator could negatively affect the subject.\n* Unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements including blood sampling and swallowing study drug suspension.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Year","maximumAge":"6 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.0","spread":"9.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-8.9","spread":"9.2"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-12.0","spread":"8.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.2","spread":"6.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-7.9","spread":"12.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-11.1","spread":"9.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Albumin/Creatinine (A/C) Ratio for Each Assigned Dose Level From Baseline to Day 28","description":null,"paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-40.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-50.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Protein/Creatinine (P/C) Ratio for Each Assigned Dose Level From Baseline to Day 28","description":null,"paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-29.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6},"commonTop":[]}}}
