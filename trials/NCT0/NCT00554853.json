New therapies are needed to prevent this complication. The purpose of this study is to establish the role of the medication pioglitazone in improving the function of the blood vessels and heart and decreasing the risk of future atherosclerosis development in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. As a secondary aim-point, we will evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone in improving rheumatoid arthritis disease activity and markers of inflammation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Brachial Artery Diameter Change From Baseline in Response to Reactive Hyperemia","timeFrame":"8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Study Drug (Pioglitazone) Then Placebo","deltaMin":8.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Then Study Drug (Pioglitazone)","deltaMin":9.43,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21727237","23962407","24252844"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":72},"commonTop":["Headaches","Edema in the Ankles","Swelling to hands, feet, knees, or legs","Weight Gain","Elevated Liver Enzymes"]}}
