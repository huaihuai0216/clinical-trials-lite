enrollment\n* Had allergy shots started or had changes in regimen or dosing of allergy shots within 4 weeks prior to study vaccination\n* Receipt of any other vaccine within 30 days prior to study vaccination, or planning to receive another vaccine within 30 days before the Visit 2 blood draw (if applicable)\n* Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine\n* Enrolled in another vaccine trial\n* Personal history of physician-diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed pertussis disease within the
