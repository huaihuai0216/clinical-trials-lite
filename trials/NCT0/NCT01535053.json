Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and dactinomycin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether methotrexate is more effective than dactinomycin in treating gestational trophoblastic disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Complete Response","timeFrame":"hCG testing is performed prior to each cycle to treatment until treatment is completed, up to 10 months.
