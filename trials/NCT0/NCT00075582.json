Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With Low-risk Rhabdomyosarcoma in Subset 1 Failure Free at 5 Years Following Study Entry","timeFrame":"From enrollment up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regimen I (Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy)","deltaMin":87,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen II (Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy, Surgery)","deltaMin":67,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":20,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":163,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35829629"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":272},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Anemia","Febrile neutropenia","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
