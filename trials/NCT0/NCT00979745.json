It is a synthetically produced analogue of human alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and is not yet available on the market.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to look at whether afamelanotide can reduce the number and severity of EPP symptoms when patients are exposed to light. This study will also look at how the drug is tolerated when taken by people with EPP.\n\nThe study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod (approximately 2 cm x 0.15 cm) to be administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a placebo (inactive medication).\n\nOver 450 subjects have been treated with afamelanotide to date with no serious safety concerns identified. For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled release depot injection (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly into the body over a few days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after afamelanotide has been released and will slowly dissolve.\n\nThis study will help to provide more information about afamelanotide. This information will be used to determine the safety and efficacy (the ability of the drug to produce an effect) of this drug in EPP sufferers.\n\nUp to 70 people will participate in this study from study sites across Europe.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Duration of Direct Sunlight Exposure Between 10:00 and 15:00 Hours on Days When Patients Did Not Report Phototoxicity-related Pain (Likert Pain Scale Score of 0)","timeFrame":"From baseline to Day 270","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental: Afamelanotide","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.75,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Finland","France","Germany","Ireland","Netherlands","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26132941"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Implant site discolouration","Blood urine present","Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased"]}}
