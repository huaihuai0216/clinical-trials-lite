The primary hypothesis of the study is that omarigliptin compared to placebo produces greater reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) after 24 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (A1C) at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Omarigliptin (Phase A)","deltaMin":-0.77,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo to Omarigliptin (Phase A)","deltaMin":-0.44,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.035"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28449320"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":106},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Blood glucose increased","Nasopharyngitis","Urinary tract infection"]}}
