Comparisons to results from a similar project in methadone-exposed pregnancies will be made. This proposal seeks to advance the way the investigators inform the treatment of the opioid dependent woman during pregnancy and her infant after birth.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Fetal Heart Rate","timeFrame":"24, 28, 32 and 36 weeks of gestation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FHR 24 Weeks Trough","deltaMin":145.7,"sd":5.8},{"arm":"FHR 28 Weeks Trough","deltaMin":143.3,"sd":5.4},{"arm":"FHR 32 Weeks Trough","deltaMin":138.6,"sd":6},{"arm":"FHR 36 Weeks Trough","deltaMin":136.3,"sd":7.1},{"arm":"FHR 24 Weeks Peak","deltaMin":143.9,"sd":6.4},{"arm":"FHR 28 Weeks Peak","deltaMin":141,"sd":4.8},{"arm":"FHR 32 Peak","deltaMin":135.4,"sd":6.3},{"arm":"FHR 36 Peak","deltaMin":131.3,"sd":6.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003 vs OG004 vs OG005 vs OG006 vs OG007","p":"0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20868741","29223912"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":49},"commonTop":["Cholestasis of pregnancy","cardiomegaly","chorioamnionitis","Fetal stress at delivery","nonreactive fetal tracing, fetal hear rate deceleration"]}}
