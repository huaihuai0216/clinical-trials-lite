The goal of the study is to test the ability of sorafenib to improve survival compared to best supportive care alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From randomization of the first subject until 36 months later","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)","deltaMin":248,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":253,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4687"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":182,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","China","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Indonesia","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Pakistan","Peru","Philippines","Poland","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":136,"n":346},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Hand-foot skin reaction","Rash/desquamation","Dyspnea (Shortness of breath)","Anorexia"]}}
