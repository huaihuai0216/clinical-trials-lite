Hand OA was assessed by calculating total score for osteophytes, cyst erosion, \\& joint space narrowing, each of which were based on sum of left and right hand X-ray analysis with possible scores of 0-66. The overall total score (possible range 0-198) was also used. Higher scores (closer to 66 or to 198 when using overall total score) imply a worse outcome. Hand analyses were based on double readings, and the mean was used in the analyses.\n\nThe AUStralian/CANadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN) questionnaire was also used for assessment of hand OA. It measures pain (5 questions), stiffness (1 question) and difficulties with daily activities (9 questions) through a visual analogue scale (0-100mm; 0 = lowest score; 100 = highest score). Lower AUSCAN scores represent a better outcome. Change (from baseline to month 24) in these scores was calculated.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.40","spread":"0.784"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":"0.754"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.45","spread":"1.063"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.62","spread":"0.990"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.83","spread":"1.204"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.82","spread":"1.327"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.68","spread":"2.682"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.84","spread":"2.714"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-51.5","spread":"265.13"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-38.1","spread":"272.07"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Nature and #
