Criteria:\n\n* Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form\n* Receiving antiretroviral therapy with a ritonavir-boosted PI and two NRTIs continuously for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations (at least two measurements) at undetectable levels for ≥ 6 months prior to the screening visit and HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at the screening visit\n* On their first or second antiretroviral drug regimen; if on their second regimen, HIV-1 RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL required at the time of the first change in antiretroviral drugs, and no HIV RNA \\> 50 copies/mL measured at two consecutive time points after first achieving HIV RNA \\< 50 copies/mL\n* No previous use of any approved or experimental nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug for any length of time\n* Have a genotype prior to starting initial antiretroviral therapy and no known resistance to any of the study agents\n* Normal ECG\n* Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin\n* Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm\\^3; platelets ≥ 50,000/mm\\^3; hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL)\n* Serum amylase ≤ 5 x ULN (subjects with serum amylase \\> 5 x ULN eligible if serum lipase ≤ 5 x ULN)\n* Adequate renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 70 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n* Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods (two separate forms of contraception, one of which must have been an effective barrier method, or been nonheterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence, or have a vasectomized partner) from screening throughout the duration of the study period and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug.\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Life expectancy ≥ 1 year\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within 30 days prior to screening except cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count and/or percentage criteria\n* Females who are breastfeeding\n* Positive serum pregnancy test (female of childbearing potential)\n* Proven or suspected acute hepatitis 30 days prior to study entry.\n* Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with subject compliance.\n* History of malignancy within 5 years prior to study entry or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma\n* Active, serious infections requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to baseline\n* Anticipated need to initiate contraindicated drugs during the study, including drugs not to be used with FTC, TDF, RPV; or subjects with known allergies to the excipients of FTC/RPV/TDF STR tablets or Truvada® tablets\n* All investigational drugs\n* Medications and use of herbal/natural supplements excluded or to be used with caution while participating in the study, including those not to be taken with Viread®, Emtriva®, Truvada, and Rilpivirine.\n* Participation in any other clinical trial without prior approval from the sponsor was prohibited while participating in this trial\n* Treatment with immunosuppressant therapies or chemotherapeutic agents within 3 months of study screening, or expected to receive these agents or systemic steroids during the study\n* History of liver disease, including Gilbert's Disease\n* Any other clinical condition or prior therapy making the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
