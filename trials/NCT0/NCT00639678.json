Baseline is defined as the value of the variable measured at Day 0 prior to dosing.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Developed an Anti-raxibacumab Antibody Response","description":"Number of participants who developed an anti-raxibacumab antibody response during the study were assessed. .Immunogenicity testing was performed to determine if raxibacumab induced an anti-raxibacumab immune response. Testing comprised of 2 assays (screening and confirmatory). The screening assay (direct binding) was an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging assay. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was used as a positive control. Samples above the assay cut point were considered positive. Samples identified as positive in the screening assay were confirmed positive in a confirmatory assay. Samples must have demonstrated a significant percent drop in the confirmatory inhibition of binding assay to be considered positive. The inhibition of binding confirmatory assay was performed identically to the direct binding screening assay with the exception that the samples were tested in parallel with excess unlabeled raxibacumab.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Raxibacumab Concentration-time Following a Single IV Infusion Dose","description":"Blood was collected from each participant at selected times post dose, and serum specimens were analyzed for raxibacumab using a validated electrochemiluminescense-based assay.
