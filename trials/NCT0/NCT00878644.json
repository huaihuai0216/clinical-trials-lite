AND\n* Age greater than 48 hours (with a corrected gestational age of at least 38 weeks) and less than 18 years; AND\n* Patient requires continuous mechanical ventilation; AND\n* The cardiac arrest was unplanned (i.e., not part of cardiac surgical procedure)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* The parent or legal guardian does not speak English or Spanish (the only two languages in which VABS II is standardized)\n* Randomization is impossible within six hours of ROSC; OR\n* Patient is on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) when arrest occurs; OR\n* Continuous infusion of epinephrine or norepinephrine at very high doses (≥2 ug/kg/minute) received immediately prior to randomization; OR Glasgow Coma Scale motor response of five (localizing pain or for infants less than two years, withdraws to touch) or six (obeys commands, or for infants, normal spontaneous movement) prior to randomization; OR\n* History of a prior cardiac arrest with chest compressions for at least two minutes during the current hospitalization but outside the 6 hour window for randomization; OR\n* Pre-existing terminal illness with life expectancy \\< 12 months; OR\n* Lack of commitment to aggressive intensive care therapies including do not resuscitate orders and other limitations to care; OR\n* Cardiac arrest was associated with severe brain, thoracic, or abdominal trauma; OR\n* Active and refractory severe bleeding prior to randomization; OR\n* Near drowning in ice water with patient core temperature ≤32 °C on presentation; OR\n* Patient is pregnant; OR\n* Patient participation in a concurrent interventional trial whose protocol, in the judgment of the THAPCA investigators, prevents effective application of one or both THAPCA therapeutic treatment arms, or otherwise significantly interferes with carrying out the THAPCA protocol; OR\n* Patient is newborn with acute birth asphyxia; OR\n\n  \\_ Patient cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after arrest (ie, would not be admitted to PICU); OR\n* Patient has sickle cell anemia; OR\n* Patient known to have pre-existing cryoglobulinemia; OR\n* Central nervous system tumor with ongoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy; OR\n* Chronic hypothermia secondary to hypovolemic, pituitary, or related condition for which body temperature is consistently below 37 °C ; OR progressive degenerative encephalopathy; OR\n* Any condition in which direct skin surface cooling would be contraindicated, such as large burns, decubitus ulcers, cellulitis, or other conditions with disrupted skin integrity (NOTE: patients with open chest CPR should be included but placement of cooling mattresses will be modified as needed); OR\n* Previous enrollment in the THAPCA Trials.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"48 Hours","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Survival With Good Neurobehavioral Outcome","description":"Survival at one-year anniversary of cardiac arrest, with a standardized VABS-II score of 70 or greater per evaluation performed at any time from 30 days prior to until 183 days after the one-year anniversary of cardiac arrest.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"111","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"107","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Survival","description":"Survival at one year after cardiac arrest","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"39","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"97","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Neurobehavioral Function From Pre-cardiac Arrest to 12 Months Post-cardiac Arrest","description":"Change in VABS-II score from baseline to one year, with death at 1 year treated as worst possible outcome, and lowest possible VABS-II score at one year (regardless of baseline VABS-II score) treated as the second worst possible outcome.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"97","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Neuropsychological Scores (for Participants That Survive)","description":"Functioning, as assessed by the Mullen Early Learning Composite (for children age \\< 5 years 9 months) or by the 2-subset version of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI).
