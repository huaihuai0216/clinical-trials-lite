The novel pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) maximal concentrations in the early morning through mid-day, when LID can be troublesome, and ii) lower concentrations in the evening, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep. This pharmacokinetic profile could enable higher doses to be tolerated with a once-nightly ER formulation than can be tolerated with an immediate-release formulation. The once-nightly dosing regimen may also provide enhanced convenience and compliance.\n\nIn a previous clinical study, ADS-5102 met its primary endpoint; LID was significantly reduced as measured by the change in UDysRS score over 8 weeks vs. placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) Score at Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-8,"sd":1.64},{"arm":"ADS-5102 (340 mg)","deltaMin":-15.9,"sd":1.62}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.0009"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":46,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34024025","33864229","29532440","28604926"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":60},"commonTop":["Hallucination, any type","Hallucination, visual","Oedema peripheral","Fall","Dizziness"]}}
