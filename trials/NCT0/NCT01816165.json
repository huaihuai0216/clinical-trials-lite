Non-esterified fatty acid elevation is a significant contributor to IR in T1D and may be a target of intervention. The hypothesis of the study is that isolated fatty acid lowering with acipimox will improve insulin action and blood vessel function and have the benefit of reducing mitochondrial oxidant generation and improving mitochondrial function in T1D. Targeting IR through fatty acid lowering is a novel approach to T1D treatment that may significantly improve current management of TID and of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in this high risk population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Insulin Sensitivity: M-value From Hyperinsulinemic Euglycemia Clamp Study","timeFrame":"day 8 of each of the 2 random order intervention phases; max 16 weeks post enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"T1 Diabetes, Acipimox","deltaMin":4.65,"sd":1.52},{"arm":"T1 Diabetes, Placebo","deltaMin":3.67,"sd":1.45},{"arm":"No T1 Diabetes, Acipimox","deltaMin":8.8,"sd":3.04},{"arm":"No T1 Diabetes, Placebo","deltaMin":9.05,"sd":2.88}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
