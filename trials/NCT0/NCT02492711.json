Tumors may be estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) positive or negative.\n* Have received at least 2 prior lines of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting, or in case of having received (neo)adjuvant pertuzumab, at least 1 prior line of anti-HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting. In either case, patients must have received prior treatment with pertuzumab, in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic setting. Prior radiotherapy, hormonal therapies, and other anti-HER2 therapies are allowed.\n* Prior treatment with at least one, and no more than three, lines of therapy overall in the metastatic setting. Patients must have progressed on or following, the most recent line of therapy.\n* Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities to ≤ Grade 1\n* Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks\n* Acceptable laboratory parameters\n* Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test performed within 14 days of randomization and on the first day of treatment. All subjects must agree to use an effective form of contraception for the duration of study treatment and for 7 months after the last dose of study drug.\n\nInfusion sub-study prior therapy requirements: Same as above, except:\n\n* Must have received 4 or more prior lines or therapy in the metastatic setting\n* Must have received prior trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known, untreated brain metastasis. Patients with signs or symptoms of brain metastasis must have a CT or MRI performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization to specifically exclude the presence of radiographically-detected brain metastases\n* History of uncontrolled seizures within 6 months of randomization\n* History of prior allogeneic bone marrow, stem-cell, or solid organ transplantation\n* History of clinically significant cardiovascular disease\n* Clinically-significant pulmonary compromise, including a requirement for supplemental oxygen use to maintain adequate oxygenation\n* Any condition that would be a contraindication to receiving trastuzumab as described in the approved local label or a condition that would prevent treatment with the physician's choice of chemotherapy","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Determined by Independent Radiological Review.","description":"PFS is measured from the time of randomization until first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever is first.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Survival (OS) Defined as the Number of Days From Randomization to the Date of Death (From Any Cause).","description":"Overall survival is the time from randomization until death from any cause","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Patients With Grade 3 or Higher Infusion Related Reactions","description":"Incidence of Grade 3 or higher infusion-related reactions for patients receiving 60-minute or 30-minute infusions of margetuximab in Cycle 2 of treatment","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"To Evaluate Progression-free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by Study Investigators.","description":null,"paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"To Evaluate the Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Determined by Independent Radiological Review.","description":"Objective response rate includes all patients with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) to study treatment","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"51","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"38","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"204","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"220","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Infusion Rate Sub-study All Safety","description":"Incidence of all grades of infusion-related reactions","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"16","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"55","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":47,"n":264},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Neutropenia","Anaemia"]}}}
