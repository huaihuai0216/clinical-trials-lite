Furthermore, the aim is to investigate the long term potential of liraglutide to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in subjects diagnosed with pre-diabetes at baseline.\n\nBased on body mass index (BMI) and pre-diabetes status, subjects will be randomised to either 68 weeks (56 weeks of randomised treatment followed by a 12 week re-randomised treatment period) or 160 weeks of treatment (160 week treatment will only be applicable to subjects with pre-diabetes status at baseline).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Fasting Body Weight","timeFrame":"Week 0, Week 56","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide 3.0 mg (56-Week)","deltaMin":-7.98,"sd":6.67},{"arm":"Liraglutide Placebo (56-Week)","deltaMin":-2.62,"sd":5.74}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":226,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Russia","Serbia and Montenegro","Serbia","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27198973","27193270","27482610","27804269","27817208","26833744","26132939","26418188","26744025","28237263","28462892","28386912","28950422","29045079","29145215","39316288","35975210"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":230,"n":1524},"commonTop":["Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Headache"]}}
