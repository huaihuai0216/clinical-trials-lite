documentation of HIV infection must be based on a federally approved, licensed HIV test performed in conjunction with screening (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay \\[ELISA\\], western blot, or other test); alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot; an approved antibody test will be used to confirm diagnosis; if the physician is treating a patient with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with a history of HIV positivity based on an approved antibody test then repeat antibody confirmation is not necessary\n* Biopsy-proven HSIL (anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (AIN2) and/or AIN3) of the anal canal at either the squamocolumnar junction or distal anus, documented within 60 days prior to enrollment, but not less than 1 week prior to enrollment\n* HSIL occupies at least 25% of the circumference of the anal canal at either the squamocolumnar junction or distal anus on high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) at screening or entry based on available biopsy results and visual appearance\n* Anal HSIL lesions are visible at study entry and no lesions are suspicious for invasive cancer\n* Ability to understand and willing to provide informed consent\n* Participants must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be capable of complying with the requirements of this protocol including self-administration of study treatment\n* Karnofsky performance status of \\>= 70%\n* Cluster of differentiation (CD)4 count \\>= 200 within 120 days prior to enrollment or plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\< 200 copies/mL within 120 days prior to enrollment\n* For females, cervical cytology (if having a cervix) and gynecologic evaluation within 12 months prior to enrollment\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 750 cells/mm\\^3 within 90 days prior to enrollment\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dL within 90 days prior to enrollment\n* Platelet count \\>= 75,000/mm\\^3 within 90 days prior to enrollment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of anal cancer\n* Prior intra-anal use of topical 5-fluorouracil 5% or imiquimod 2.5%, 3.75% or 5% at any point, or use of perianal imiquimod 2.5%, 3.75% or 5% or topical 5-fluorouracil 5% within 6 months prior to enrollment\n* Extensive concurrent perianal or lower vulvar HSIL or condyloma requiring a different treatment modality than the study treatment, or treatment that cannot be deferred in observation arm, per examining provider\n* Condyloma occupying more than 50% of the circumference of the anal canal or that obscures a satisfactory exam\n* Ongoing use of anticoagulant therapy other than aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n* Acute treatment for an infection (excluding fungal infection of the skin and sexually transmitted infections) or other serious medical illness within 14 days prior to study entry\n* Malignancy requiring systemic therapy;
