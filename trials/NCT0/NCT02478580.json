This group of patients is at risk of perioperative desaturations which can be worsened by perioperative sedatives and narcotics needed for surgery. OSA patients might also need to spend the night in intensive care for more frequent monitoring for any desaturations episodes especially if the patient will be requiring multiple intravenous narcotic boluses for pain control. Several studies have looked into the most appropriate way to manage these patients and some recommendations have been made to avoid outpatient surgery with close monitoring for first 24 hours after surgery specifically if patient will require intravenous postoperative narcotics.\n\nNuvigil (Armodafinil) is a wake promoting agent (Cephalon inc., West Chester, PA) that's FDA approved for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, shift work sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. The precise mechanism(s) through which armodafinil (R-enantiomer) or modafinil (mixture of R- and S-enantiomers) promote wakefulness is unknown.\n\nNuvigil is longer acting product which is similar in action to Modafinil however is much cheaper. Nuvigil has not been previously studied for postoperative recovery. The investigators intend to study the effects of Nuvigil on postoperative recovery time and wakefulness in obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postoperative Care Unit (PACU) Recovery Time","timeFrame":"Immediate postoperative period (up to 3 hours)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nuvigil","deltaMin":98.2,"sd":58.2},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":95,"sd":60.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":34},"commonTop":[]}}
