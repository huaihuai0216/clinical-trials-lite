Diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD).\n2. At least 30 years old at the time of PD diagnosis.\n3. Currently being treated with carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone (CLE) and on a stable regimen of conventional LD for at least 4 weeks and:\n\n   * Requiring a total daily levodopa (LD) dose of at least 400 mg\n   * Having a minimum dosing frequency of four times per day.\n   * Individual CD-LD or CLE doses that contain an LD dose which is a multiple of 50 mg.\n4. Able to differentiate \"on\" state from \"off\" state.\n5. Have predictable \"off\" periods.\n6. Amantadine, anticholinergics, selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, rasagiline) or dopamine agonists are allowed as long as the doses and regimens have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and the therapy is intended to be constant throughout the course of the study.\n7.

Diagnosed with atypical Parkinsonism or any known secondary Parkinsonian syndrome.\n2. Nonresponsive to LD therapy.\n3. Prior functional neurosurgical treatment for PD (e.g., ablation or deep brain stimulation) or if such procedures are anticipated during study participation.\n4. Received within 4 weeks of Screening or planning to take during participation in the clinical study: any controlled-release LD product, tolcapone, apomorphine, nonselective MAO inhibitors, or antipsychotics including neuroleptic agents for the purpose of treating psychosis or bipolar disorder.\n5. Allergy or hypersensitivity to CD, LD, entacapone, riboflavin, Yellow Dye #5 (tartrazine), citrus fruit or grape juice.\n6. History of or currently active psychosis.\n7. Active or prior medical conditions such as peptic ulcers or prior surgical (e.g., bowel) procedures that would interfere with LD absorption.\n8. Active or history of narrow-angle glaucoma.\n9.
