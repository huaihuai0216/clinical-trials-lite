Subjects will be randomized to receive either FF/VI 100/25 via NDPI or Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol 250/50mcg via ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Matching placebos will be available in NDPI and ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Each morning (approximately 6-10 AM) subjects will take 1 inhalation from the NDPI followed by 1 inhalation from the ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Each evening (approximately 6-10 PM), approximately 12 hours after the morning dose with blinded study medication, subjects will take 1 inhalation from the ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Subjects will return to the clinic at the end of the treatment period.\n\nA follow-up phone contact will be performed approximately 7 days after the last clinic visit. The overall study duration (Screening to Follow-up) for each subject is approximately 15 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline Trough in Weighted-mean 24-hour Serial Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Treatment Day 84","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 84","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 µg QD","deltaMin":0.168,"sd":0.0121},{"arm":"FP/Salmeterol 250/50 µg BID","deltaMin":0.142,"sd":0.012}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.137"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":63,"countries":["United States","Germany","Romania","Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24998880"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":412},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache"]}}
