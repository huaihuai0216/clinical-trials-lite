PAS is an 8 point ordinal scale for quantification of penetration and aspiration. PAS measures the depth to which material enters the airway and if the material is expelled following penetration or aspiration. Categorical groupings of PAS scores include \"normal to mild\" (1-2), \"moderate\" (3-5) and \"severe\" (6-8, indicating that material has passed into the lower airway). These PAS scores may be useful in denoting clinically significant changes (e.g. moderate to mild) resulting from treatment or disease progression. The following table reports the percentage of participants (out of the respective total group participants in EMST and Sham) with changed PAS score of 1 point or more (improving or worsening) and without PAS score changes from pre- to post treatment. The data represent an exploratory quantification without statistical analysis.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"45.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"64.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Swallow-related Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL)","description":"The SWAL-QOL is a validated and standardized tool that measures burden; symptom status including pharyngeal, oral, and saliva; fear; and mental health subdomains.
