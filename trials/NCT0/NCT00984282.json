Progression was assessed by RECIST criteria, version 1.0, modified for bone lesions. PFS for participants without disease progression or death at the time of analysis or unblinding were censored at the last date of tumor assessment before unblinding. Participants with no tumor evaluation after baseline were censored at Day 1. PD (Progression Disease)=At least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameters (LD) of measured lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD on study since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. New lesions also constituted PD. In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of a nonmeasured lesion may have been accepted as evidence of disease progression in participants with measurable disease.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"329","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"175","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"Overall survival was defined as the time (days) from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause.
