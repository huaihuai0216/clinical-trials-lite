The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure is a 29-item questionnaire divided into two subscales: the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, 21-item Activities of Daily Living Subscale and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure, 8-item Sports Subscale.\n\nEach item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (4 to 0) from 'no difficulty at all' (score 4), ´slight difficulty´, ´moderate difficulty´, éxtreme difficulty´ to 'unable to do' (score 0). Responses marked as ´not applicable´were not counted.\n\nItem score totals, which range from 0 to 84 for the ADL subscale and 0 to 32 for the Sports subscale, were transformed to percentage scores. Higher scores represent higher levels of function for each subscale, with 100% representing no dysfunction.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26.20","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26.20","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"25.00","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"FAAM ADL Subscale","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"FAAM Sports Subscale","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Swelling ('Figure-of-eight')","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Physician's Assessment of Normal Function/Activity (5-point-scale)","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Normal Function (Training/Sports)","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Global Judgment of Efficacy","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Patient's Assessment of Ankle Pain (VAS)- Percentage Decrease on Day 7","description":"Pain evaluated by a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) where 0 means no pain and 100 means the highest, unbearable pain.
