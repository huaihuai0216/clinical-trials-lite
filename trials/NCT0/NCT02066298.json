For each participant, treatments are first compared to see if they differ in terms of treatment failures. If one treatment results in no treatment failures and another treatment does, it is deemed the superior treatment and no further comparisons are made. If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by treatment failures, then they are compared by asthma control days (ACDs). If one treatment yields at least 31 annualized ACDs more than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority still cannot be assigned by ACDs, then they are compared by percent predicted FEV1 at the end of a treatment period. If one treatment yields at least 5% greater FEV1 than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by exacerbations, ACDs or FEV1, then that participant is classified as having no differential response.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"74","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"35","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"56","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"80","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"49","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Treatment Failure","description":"Treatment Failure includes:\n\n* Awakening from asthma three or more times in a two-week period or on two consecutive nights, or\n* Using albuterol for relief of symptoms four or more times/day for two or more consecutive days, or\n* Albuterol has been relieving symptoms for less than four hours after each treatment over a 12-hour period, or\n* Using albuterol for relief of symptoms daily for seven days, and this use exceeds two times the weekly use of albuterol in the baseline period, or\n* exercise induces unusual breathlessness","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"35","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Annualized Asthma Control Days","description":"Asthma Control Days (ACD) are based on patient completed electronic daily diaries, and are defined as: A day with no rescue albuterol use (pre-exercise albuterol will not be counted), no non-study asthma medications, no daytime asthma symptoms (shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, phlegm/mucus rated as mild, moderate or severe, or cough rated as moderate or severe), no nighttime asthma symptoms, no unscheduled healthcare visits for asthma, and no PEF \\< 80% of predetermined baseline.
