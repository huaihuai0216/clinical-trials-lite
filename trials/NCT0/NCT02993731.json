Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient appropriately in accordance with applicable International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines and local and regulatory requirements prior to the performance of any study specific procedure.\n2. Must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that is metastatic. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic PDAC will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded.\n3. Must not have previously received chemotherapy or any investigational agent for the treatment of PDAC. A fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine administered as a radiation sensitizer in the adjuvant setting is allowed for as long as last dose was administered \\> 6 months prior to randomization and no lingering toxicities are present.\n4. Nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine therapy is appropriate for the patient and recommended by the Investigator.\n5. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors evaluable by CT scan with contrast (or MRI, if patient is allergic to CT contrast media) per RECIST 1.1. Imaging investigations including CT/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis or other scans as necessary to document all sites of disease must be performed within 14 days prior to randomization. Qualifying scans performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of the study informed consent will be acceptable as baseline scanning as long as scanning is performed \\< 14 days prior to randomization.\n6. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1, assessed within 14 days prior to randomization. Two observers qualified to perform assessment of the performance status will be required to perform this assessment. If discrepant, the one with the most deteriorated performance status will be considered true.\n7. Must have life-expectancy of \\> 12 weeks.\n8. Must be ≥ 18 years of age. Due to increased risk of sepsis in patients \\>80 years old, candidate patients in this age group should be thoroughly evaluated prior to study randomization to ensure they are fit to receive chemotherapy. In addition to all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria listed, clinical judgment should be used regarding patients' susceptibility to infection (including but not limited to presence of ascites or diabetes mellitus increasing risk of infection). Furthermore, the expected stability of their performance status while receiving repeat weekly chemotherapy cycles should be given special attention. Patients in this age group should not be randomized on the study should there be any hesitation on any of these considerations.\n9. For male or female patients of child producing potential: Must agree to use contraception or take measures to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 180 days after the final dose of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine or for 30 days for female patients and for 90 days for male patients, after the final napabucasin dose if nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine were not administered.\n10. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 5 days prior to randomization.\n11. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood counts at baseline (obtained \\< 14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed \\< 14 days prior to randomization):\n\n    1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1.5 x 10\\^9/L\n    2. Platelet count \\> 100,000/mm\\^3 (100 x 10\\^9/L). Must not have required transfusion of platelets within 1 week of baseline platelet count assessment.\n    3. Hemoglobin (HgB) \\> 9 g/dL. Must not have required transfusion of red blood cells within 1 week of baseline Hgb assessment.\n12. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at baseline (obtained \\< 14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed \\< 14 days prior to randomization):\n\n    1. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) \\[≤ 5 × ULN in presence of liver metastases\\]\n    2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional ULN. If total bilirubin is \\> ULN and \\< 1.5 x ULN, it must be non-rising for at least 7 days.\n    3. Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated clearance \\> 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or below the institutional normal value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be used for calculating creatinine clearance (eg. Using the Cockcroft-Gault formula). For patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) \\> 30 kg/m\\^2, lean body weight should be used instead.\n13. Patient not on anticoagulation has acceptable coagulation studies (obtained \\< 14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed \\< 14 days prior to randomization) as demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) below or within normal limits (+15%).\n\n    Patients on anticoagulation must have coagulation values within the therapeutic range appropriate for the anti-coagulation indication.\n14. Patient has no clinically significant abnormalities on urinalysis results (obtained \\< 14 days prior to randomization; laboratory testing performed as part of standard of care prior to patient signature of informed consent for the study will be acceptable as baseline laboratory work as long as testing is performed \\< 14 days prior to randomization).\n15. Patient must have adequate nutritional status with Body Mass Index (BMI) \\> 18 kg/m\\^2 and body weight of \\> 40 kg with serum albumin \\> 3 g/dL.\n16. Baseline laboratory evaluations must be done within 14 days prior to randomization and some must be repeated \\< 72 hours prior to randomization.\n17. Patients requiring biliary stent placement must have biliary stent placed \\> 7 days prior to screening.\n18. Pain symptoms should be stable (of tolerable Grade 2 or less).\n19. Only patients with available archival tumor tissue must consent to provision of, and Investigator(s) must confirm access to and agree to submit a representative formalin fixed paraffin block of tumor tissue in order that the specific correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) of this protocol may be conducted. Submission of the tissue does not have to occur prior to randomization. Where local center regulations prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block and 5-20 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are preferred. Where it is not possible to obtain two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block, 5-20 unstained slides of representative tumor tissue are also acceptable. Where no previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists or is available, on the approval of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be considered eligible for the study.\n20. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific correlative marker assays (Correlative Studies) may be conducted.\n21. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this trial must receive protocol treatment and be followed at the participating center. This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must ensure that the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.\n22. Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 calendar days of patient randomization for patients randomized to Arm 1. Patients randomized to Arm 2 must begin protocol treatment within 7 calendar days of randomization.\n23. The patient is not receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and the patient agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during their participation in this trial while on study treatment. Patients participating in surveys or observational studies are eligible to participate in this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
