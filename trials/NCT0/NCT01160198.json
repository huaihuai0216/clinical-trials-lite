Effective control of iron deficiency anaemia decreases the incidence of fatigue, bodyache, headache, lack of concentration and menstrual complications. Iron bisglycine chelate has been used successfully to treat iron deficiency anaemia and is also a well tolerated therapy. Use of ferrous bisglycinate chelate one tablet daily as a nutritional supplement is well established in India. For treatment of iron deficiency anaemia, some women may need 1 tablet/day, while some may need 2 tablets/day. In India, ferrous ascorbate, 1 tablet daily is a widely accepted form of treatment for iron deficiency anaemia. The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and tolerability profile of ferrous bisglycinate chelate to support the registration of this product as a 'drug' in India. Comparative data between ferrous bisglycinate chelate and ferrous ascorbate will also augment our existing knowledge, which will further support appropriate use of ferrous bisglycinate chelate for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Study design and patient population: This will be a multicentre, randomized, laboratory-blinded, parallel- group study. It is projected that the study will randomize 270 women (90 subjects in each treatment arm) with iron deficiency anaemia (Hb 6-9 gm/dl + serum Ferritin \\<15 μg/l) to either ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 or 2 tablets/day, or ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet/day for 8 weeks. At fortnightly visits, blood will be collected for Hb (to evaluate efficacy), adverse events will be documented (to evaluate tolerability), the investigational drugs will be dispensed and reasons for non compliance will be recorded. Study endpoints: The primary endpoint is defined as the rise of Hb from baseline after 8 weeks of treatment in each ferrous bisglycinate chelate group (1 tablet/day and 2 tablets/day). The secondary endpoints include the difference in the average change in Hb, difference in the rate of rise of Hb, difference in the proportion of patients who achieve a target Hb ≥12gm/dl and difference in the % incidence of gastrointestinal side effects during 8 week therapy with 2 dosing regimens of ferrous bisglycinate chelate (1 tablet/day and 2 tablets/day) and ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet/day.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin (Hb) After 8 Weeks of Treatment in Each Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate Group (1 Tablet Daily and 2 Tablets Daily)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate 60 mg 1 Once-daily","deltaMin":2.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate 60 mg 1 Twice-daily","deltaMin":2.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":89},"commonTop":["Abdominal discomfort","Dyspepsia","Gastritis","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
