Subjects have a body weight of less than 40 kg.\n14. Subjects have a history of progressive malignancy within the previous 5 years (excluding a history of non-metastasized and adequately treated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma).\n15. Subjects have a history of psychiatric illness or mood disorder requiring electro-convulsive or drug therapy within the previous 6 months which is considered uncontrolled; a history of suicide attempt; alcohol or drug abuse; chronic treatment with benzodiazepines or barbiturates.\n16.
