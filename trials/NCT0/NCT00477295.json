Assessment of eligibility will take place at the Screening Visit. The subjects will be randomized to either the carbamazepine or zonisamide arm at the Randomization Visit (T1). T1 must occur as soon as possible (and at least within 14 days) of the Screening Visit in order to optimize subject care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Seizure Freedom for 26-weeks During the Maintenance Phase","timeFrame":"Week 31 through Week 109","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zonisamide","deltaMin":79.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Carbamazepine","deltaMin":83.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":79,"countries":["Australia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","India","Italy","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22683226"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":281},"commonTop":["headache","somnolence","dizziness","decreased appetite","weight decreased"]}}
