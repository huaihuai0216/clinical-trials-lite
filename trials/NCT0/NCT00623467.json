The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy (how well does it work) of Gadavist when used for taking images of the brain and spine. The results of the MRI will be compared to the results of images taken without Gadavist.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Blinded Reader 1 (BR1)","timeFrame":"Up to 2 hours after injection of gadobutrol","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Unenhanced","deltaMin":0.94,"sd":0.25},{"arm":"Gadobutrol (Gadavist, BAY86-4875)","deltaMin":2.96,"sd":0.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States","Argentina","China","Colombia","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":343},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Fatigue","White blood cells urine positive","Red blood cells urine positive"]}}
