Scores from all 10 questions added up to give total DLQI scores ranged from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much), higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. LS means and SE were obtained from ANCOVA model.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.67","spread":"0.90"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-10.95","spread":"0.89"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)","description":"An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.
