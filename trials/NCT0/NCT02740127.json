A caudal nerve block (CNB) is a local anesthetic injected near the tailbone, in addition to general anesthesia, which can lower the need for pain drugs.\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to learn how effective CNBs are in patients who are having penile prosthesis surgery compared to patients who only have general anesthesia by studying how long you stay in the hospital and the level of pain you have after surgery.\n\nThis is an investigational study. The general anesthesia and CNB used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available. It is considered investigational to compare the effectiveness of CNBs in penile prosthesis surgery to general anesthesia alone. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.\n\nUp to 104 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Post-Operative Pain Medication Usage in Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"General Anesthesia and Caudal Nerve Block","deltaMin":13.0208,"sd":11.6362},{"arm":"General Anesthesia Only","deltaMin":15.1786,"sd":16.6022}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":[]}}
