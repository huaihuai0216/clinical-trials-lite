Subjects who cannot perform acceptable spirometry, i.e., meet ATS/ERS acceptability criteria.\n  2. Repeatability: Subjects who cannot perform technically acceptable spirometry in accordance with ATS repeatability criteria\n* Cancer: Subjects who have cancer that has not been in complete remission for at least five years.\n* Substance Abuse: Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, significantly abuse alcohol or drugs\n* Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator are unable to abstain from prohibited medications including LABA/LAMAs/ICS","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Specific Image-based Airway Volume (siVaw)","description":"Specific image-based airway volume (SiVaw) measured in mL/L.
