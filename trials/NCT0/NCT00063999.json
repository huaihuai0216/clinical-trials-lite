pathological confirmation and estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) status of the primary tumor is mandatory; however, the results do not need to be available prior to registration\n* Patients may not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy, including chemotherapy used for radiation sensitization; patients may have received prior radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or therapy with biologic agents, but such therapies must be discontinued prior to entry on this study\n* Patients in whom both radiation and chemotherapy is planned must receive radiation prior to entry on this study; at least four weeks should have elapsed since completion of radiation therapy (RT) involving the whole pelvis or over 50% of the spine\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcl\n* Granulocytes (absolute neutrophil count \\[ANC\\]) \\>= 1,500/mcl\n* Creatinine =\\< upper limit of normal (ULN) (Common Toxicity Criteria \\[CTC\\] grade 0) or calculated creatinine clearance (Jeliffe Formula) \\>= 60 ml/min\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\]) =\\< 3 x upper limits of normal\n* Bilirubin =\\< institutional upper limits of normal\n* Patients must have a Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2\n* Patients must have met the pre-entry requirements\n* Patients must have signed an approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health information\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with a concomitant malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer;
