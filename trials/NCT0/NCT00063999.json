Drugs used in chemotherapy such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating endometrial cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Alive at Time of Last Follow-up.","timeFrame":"Patients were assessed during treatment.
