Unemancipated subjects under 18 years old must provide assent and have written parental consent documented on the consent form consistent with local legal requirements;\n* Plan to reside within a reasonable driving distance of a research site for the duration of the study.\n* Subject agrees not to self-remove VeraCept\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known or suspected pregnancy; or at risk for pregnancy from unprotected intercourse earlier in current cycle;\n* A previously inserted intrauterine device (IUD) that has not been removed by the time the study IUD is placed;\n* History of previous IUD complications, such as perforation, expulsion, or pregnancy with IUD in place;\n* Pain with current IUD;\n* Use of ParaGard IUD within the past 3 months\n* Planned use of any non-contraceptive estrogen, progesterone or testosterone any time during the 60 months of study participation;\n* Exclusively breastfeeding before return of menses; lactating women will be excluded unless they have had 2 normal menstrual periods prior to enrollment;\n* Unexplained abnormal uterine bleeding (suspicious for a serious condition), including bleeding 4 weeks post-septic abortion or puerperal sepsis;\n* Severely heavy or painful menstrual bleeding;\n* Suspected or known cervical, uterine or ovarian cancer, or unresolved clinically significant abnormal Pap smear requiring evaluation or treatment;\n* Any history of gestational trophoblastic disease with or without detectable elevated ß-human chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) levels, or related malignant disease;\n* Any congenital or acquired uterine anomaly that may complicate study drug placement, such as:\n\n  * Submucosal uterine leiomyoma\n  * Asherman's syndromes\n  * Pedunculated polyps\n  * Bicornuate uterus\n  * Didelphus or uterine septa\n* Any distortions of the uterine cavity (e.g. fibroids), that, in the opinion of the investigator, are likely to cause issues during insertion, retention or removal of the IUD;\n* Untreated acute cervicitis or vaginitis within the past 3 months;\n* Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or clinical AIDS;\n* Subjects who have an established immunodeficiency;\n* Known intolerance or allergy to any components of VeraCept or ParaGard including intolerance or allergy to nickel, titanium, or copper, and including Wilson's Disease;\n* Currently participating or planning future participation in a research study of an investigational drug or device during the course of this investigational study. Subject must have waited at least 30 days from exiting their last study prior to informed consent in this study;\n* Subject has been enrolled in a previous VeraCept study;\n* Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months prior to the screening visit;\n* Any general health, mental health or behavioral condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could represent an increased risk for the subject or would render the subject less likely to provide the needed study information;\n* Study staff or a member of the immediate family of study staff.\n* Concurrent use of
