Subjects received either a weight-based or a fixed dose of oral BCV once weekly (QW) or twice weekly (BIW) for up to 3 months until clinical disease was resolved or stabilized and/or viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction testing was negative for 4 consecutive weeks, whichever was longer. Under the first protocol amendment, adults and adolescents (≥13 years) received 200 mg or 300 mg BCV BIW (not to exceed 4 mg/kg total weekly dose) depending on the difficulty of treating their disease (i.e., Group 1 or Group 2, respectively), and pediatric subjects (≤12 years) received 4 mg/kg BCV BIW. Under the second protocol amendment, adults and adolescents (≥13 years), regardless of viral infection/disease, had a maximum weekly dose of 200 mg, i.e., 200 mg QW or 100 mg BIW; not to exceed 4mg/kg total weekly dose. Pediatric subjects (≤12 years), regardless of viral infection/disease, had a maximum weekly dose of 4 mg/kg, i.e., 4 mg/kg QW or 2 mg/kg BIW; not to exceed 200 mg.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Who Had a Sustained and Significant Reduction in Plasma Viral Load of Primary dsDNA Virus","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BCV (≤4 mg/kg/Week)","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"BCV (>4 mg/kg/Week)","deltaMin":18,"sd":null},{"arm":"BCV (≤200 mg/Week)","deltaMin":39,"sd":null},{"arm":"BCV (>200 mg/Week)","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27851688"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":30},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Acute graft versus host disease","Vomiting","Pyrexia"]}}
