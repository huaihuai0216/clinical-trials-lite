The primary analysis considered both inactive disease status and the patient dose step duration.\n\nIn the event the inactive disease status was missing, yet the patient remained at the same dose level through the next visit with the same disease status, it was concluded that inactive disease was maintained during this time period and was carried forward.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number and Percentage of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Canakinumab - PART 1","description":"AEs, Deaths, other serious adverse events or discontinuations due to AE, Part I (Safety set)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number and Percentage of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Canakinumab - PART 2","description":"AEs, Deaths, other serious adverse events or discontinuations due to AE, Part II (Safety set)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":166},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}}
