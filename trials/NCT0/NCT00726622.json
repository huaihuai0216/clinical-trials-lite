The two types of surgery are laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection and open laparotomy rectal resection. Although laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection is being used for rectal cancer in some medical centers, the effectiveness of this type of surgery compared to open surgery is unknown. The study will compare the safety and effectiveness of the surgeries, recovery from surgery in the hospital, overall recovery from surgery and cancer outcome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Comparing Laparoscopic-assisted Resection to Open Rectal Resection for Rectal Cancer as Measured by the Percentage of Patients With Successful Resection Based on Pathological Evaluation.","timeFrame":"At time of Surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Open Laparotomy and Rectal Resection","deltaMin":86.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Laparoscopic-assisted Rectal Resection","deltaMin":81.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.41"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26441179"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":239},"commonTop":["Rectal pain","Erectile dysfunction","Fecal incontinence","Nausea","Fatigue"]}}
