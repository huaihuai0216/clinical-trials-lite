Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectum (≤ 12 cm from the anal verge)\n2. T3, N0, M0, T1-3, N1-2, M0 disease as determined by pre-neoadjuvant therapy CT scans and pelvic MRI or transrectal ultrasound. Patients with T4 disease are not eligible.\n3. Completion of pre-operative 5FU based chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Capecitabine may be substituted for 5FU.\n4. Age ≥ 18 years\n5. ECOG (Zubrod) Performance Status ≤ 2\n6. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 34\n7. No evidence of conditions that would preclude use of a laparoscopic approach (eg, multiple previous major laparotomies, severe adhesions)\n8. No systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic) that would preclude surgery. No other severe incapacitating disease:\n\n   * ASA IV: A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life. OR\n   * ASA V: A moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation.\n9. No concurrent or previous invasive pelvic malignancy (cervical, uterine and rectal) within five years prior to registration\n10. No history of psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.\n\nNOTE: Incompetent patients are not eligible for this trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Comparing Laparoscopic-assisted Resection to Open Rectal Resection for Rectal Cancer as Measured by the Percentage of Patients With Successful Resection Based on Pathological Evaluation.","description":"The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of oncologic factors which are indicative of an adequate surgical resection based on pathologic evaluation.\n\nPrimary endpoint parameters:\n\n* Circumferential margin \\> 1 mm\n* Negative distal margin\n* Completeness of total mesorectal excision (TME) A complete TME is a rectal resection specimen that has an intact mesorectum and covering peritoneal envelope all the way to the level of rectal transection with no coning in of the mesorectum above the point of transection.
