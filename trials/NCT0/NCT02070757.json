The primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of ceftolozane/tazobactam versus meropenem in adult participants with ventilated nosocomial pneumonia (VNP) based on the difference in Day 28 all-cause mortality rates in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) population using a non-inferiority margin of 10%.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With All Cause Mortality in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population - Day 28","timeFrame":"Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ceftolozane/Tazobactam","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Meropenem","deltaMin":25.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26096377","36773112","36457059","35781341","34600585","34380538","33318005","32996064","32988827","31563344"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":152,"n":361},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Diarrhoea","Urinary tract infection","Decubitus ulcer","Hydrothorax"]}}
