Subjects must have used the same method for at least one (1) month prior to starting the study.\n7. No clinically significant abnormal findings in the medical history, on the physical examination or electrocardiogram (QTcF\\<450 msec for males and QTcF\\<470 msec for females).\n8. Subjects and caregivers must agree to return to the study site for all study visits and must be willing to comply with all required study procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. A history of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematologic, endocrine, oncologic, pulmonary, immunologic, psychiatric, or cardiovascular disease, or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject.\n2.
