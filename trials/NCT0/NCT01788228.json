Non-childbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if they have practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and have a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and agree to practice adequate contraception for two months following the last dose of vaccine.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence or evidence of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.\n* Presence of a temperature ≥ 38.0ºC (≥100.4ºF) or acute symptoms greater than \"mild\" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination.\n\nNOTE: The subject may be vaccinated at a later date, provided symptoms have resolved, vaccination occurs within the window specified by the protocol, and all other eligibility criteria continue to be satisfied.\n\n* Significant risk of complications from intramuscular injections due to disorder of coagulation. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose aspirin, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency, are eligible. Assessment of risk of injection complications should be made in the context of individual subject risk of H5N1 virus infection.\n* An acute evolving neurological disorder or Guillain Barré Syndrome within 42 days of receipt of prior seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine.\n* Administration of an inactive vaccine within 14 days or of a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine.\n* Planned administration of any vaccine other than the study vaccine before Day 42.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines or component used in the manufacturing process of the study vaccine including a history of anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.\n* Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test result before the first vaccination.\n* Lactating or nursing women.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms Overall and by Age Category (18-64 and >64 Years of Age).","description":"Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling.
