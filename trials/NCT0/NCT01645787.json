This measure is an objective evaluation of functional capacity which measures the distance a person can walk quickly in six minutes and is most representative of a person's ability because the test intensity is self-selected. The 6MWT can be safely performed in ambulatory SMA patients and correlates with standard SMA outcome measures including timed walking tests. In SMA, the 6MWT may be more sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in patients with type 3 SMA as it is a direct measure of their functional mobility.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"293.05","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"299.50","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) With Kinematic Evaluation of Gait (Long Term)","description":"The primary outcome measure will be distance walked in the 6MWT.

The nerve conduction study involves the administration of modest electrical stimulations (pulsations or throbbing sensations from low level electricity) to a total of 4 nerves in the right arm and leg while recording the response over a muscle innervated by each nerve. MUNE is calculated by determining the compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude or area under the curve of a distal muscle in response to supramaximal stimulation, and then dividing the result by the amplitude or area under the curve of a single motor unit action potential.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"190.86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"194.26","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["Fall","Dizziness","Headache/migraine","Upper Respiratory Infection (URI)","Insomnia"]}}}
