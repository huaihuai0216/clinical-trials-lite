The purpose of this extension study is to investigate the long-term treatment of CIDP with IgPro20, with regard to safety and efficacy.\n\nSubjects who have completed subcutaneous (SC) Week 25 or were successfully rescued from a CIDP relapse during the SC Treatment Period of pivotal study IgPro20\\_3003 (NCT01545076) will have the option to receive open-label low-dose IgPro20 (0.2 g/kg bodyweight \\[bw\\]) weekly for up to 48 weeks. Subjects relapsing on low-dose IgPro20 will either return to high-dose IgPro20 (0.4 g/kg) immediately or be discontinued, depending on investigator's judgment. Subjects returning to high-dose IgPro20 will continue on high-dose until they have completed a total of 48 weeks of IgPro20 treatment. If subjects do not successfully recover from CIDP relapse within 4 weeks, they will be withdrawn.\n\nThe treatment duration will be up to 48 weeks, followed by a completion visit (week 49).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Adverse Events (AEs) Per Infusion","timeFrame":"Up to 49 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IgPro20","deltaMin":0.032,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":82},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Infusion site swelling","Infusion site swelling","Infusion site erythema","Infusion Site erythema"]}}
