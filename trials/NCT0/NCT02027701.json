Scores for arm disability range from 0 (\"No upper limb problems\") to 5 (\"Inability to use either arm for any purposeful movement\"), and scores for leg disability range from 0 (\"Walking not affected\") to 5 (\"Restricted to wheelchair, unable to stand and walk a few steps with help\"). The INCAT (total) score is the sum of these 2 scores and ranges from 0 to 10. For the \"adjusted\" INCAT score, changes in the function of the upper limbs from 0 (normal) to 1 (minor symptoms) or from 1 to 0 were not recorded as deterioration or improvement because these changes are not considered clinically significant.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Medical Research Council (MRC) Score","description":"An adapted version of the MRC sum score as published by Kleyweg and the RMC trial group was used.
