See if pre-cessation treatment with nicotine patches leads to a decrease in number of cigarettes smoked per day.\n4. See if sending 2-weeks' worth of patches is helpful to the quitting process.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Have Not Used Tobacco in the Past 30 Days","timeFrame":"2-months post enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pre-Patch and Telephone Counseling","deltaMin":18,"sd":null},{"arm":"Post-Patch and Telephone Counseling","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Telephone Counseling and no Patches Sent","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":80},"commonTop":[]}}
