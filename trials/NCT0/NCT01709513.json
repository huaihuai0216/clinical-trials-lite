An atorvastatin arm is added to determine that the population selected in the study is a truly statin intolerant population by assessing skeletal muscle-related adverse events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Calculated LDL-C at Week 24 - Intent--To-Treat (ITT) Analysis","timeFrame":"From Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ezetimibe","deltaMin":-14.6,"sd":2.2},{"arm":"Alirocumab 75 mg/ up to 150 mg","deltaMin":-45,"sd":2.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States","Austria","Canada","France","Israel","Italy","Norway","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25499937","26687696","34298554","32192644","30183102","28964736","27777279"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":63},"commonTop":["Myalgia","Muscle spasms","Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Back pain"]}}
