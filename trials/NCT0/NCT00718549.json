After 6 months of RCC induction therapy, participants will be randomized either to receive maintenance treatment with rituximab or to receive no treatment (observation only) for 96 weeks. Participants completing maintenance/observation period will be followed-up for approximately 3 years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression (PD), Relapse, or Death Due to Any Cause Assessed According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Revised Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)","timeFrame":"From randomization to PD, Relapse, or death due to any cause (overall approximately 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Maintenance Arm: Rituximab","deltaMin":27.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Observation Arm: No Intervention","deltaMin":54.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"All Randomized Participants","deltaMin":40.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["Belarus","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":62},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Thrombocytopenia","Nausea","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea"]}}
