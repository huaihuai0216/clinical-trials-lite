Women being fitted for a pessary for the first time or not wearing a pessary for \\>1 year are recruited in to the study and randomized to using Trimo-San gel daily or not using Trimo-San gel. The investigators use two objective measures of bacterial vaginosis (OSOM BV blue and gram stain) and subjective questionnaires regarding the presence and effect of vaginal symptoms on the pessary user prior to pessary fitting and at 3 months post pessary fitting. The investigators hypothesize that Trimo-San gel with not significantly affect the rate of bacterial vaginosis in pessary wearers as measures by OSOM BV blue and Gram stain, but will have a positive effect on the subjective symptoms experienced by women wearing pessaries.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Bacterial Vaginosis at 3 Months","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trimo-San Group","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11005473","3259075","15118630","15883856","12734228","15750100","15799757","33207004","30807423","29474292","25935783"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":92},"commonTop":["Any vaginal symptom attributable possibly to pessary"]}}
