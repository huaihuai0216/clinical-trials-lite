The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required treatment (either continuous or intermittent) in the past, and require treatment with an INCS throughout the entire study period.\n* At least one treatment for PAR during the 6 months prior to expected randomization was a nasal spray.\n* A demonstrated sensitivity to at least one allergen known to induce PAR (house dust mites, animal dander, cockroach, and molds) based on a documented result with a standard skin-prick test either within 90 days prior to or at screening. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than the negative control wheal for the skin-prick test. The subject's positive test for the allergen must be consistent with the medical history of PAR and the allergen must be present in the subject's environment throughout the study.\n* Based upon subject's medical history, in the investigator's judgment, the subject is unlikely to have a seasonal allergy exacerbation during the study.\n* Subject, if female ≤ 65 years of age, must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. Females of childbearing potential must be instructed to and agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and must use an acceptable method of birth control: a. An oral contraceptive, an intrauterine device (IUD), implantable contraceptive, transdermal or injectable contraceptive for at least 1 month prior to entering the study with continued use throughout the study and for 30 days following completion of study participation. b.Barrier method of contraception, e.g., condom and/or diaphragm with spermicide while participating in the study. c.Abstinence.\n* The subject must possess a degree of understanding of written English, in the opinion of the investigator that enables them to complete the Phase V® Technologies Inc. (PVT) Modules.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.\n* History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations; recent nasal biopsy; nasal trauma; or nasal ulcers or perforations.

Use of short-acting beta-agonists for exercise-induced bronchospasm is allowed.\n* Expected use of any disallowed medications during the study period.\n* Expected initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or planned dose escalation during the study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to screening and use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be considered for inclusion.\n* Non-vaccinated exposure to or active infection with chickenpox or measles within the 21 days preceding screening.\n* Expected initiation of pimecrolimus cream 1% or greater or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or greater during the study period or planned dose escalation during the study period. However, initiation of these creams/ointments 30 days or more prior to screening and use of a stable (maintenance) dose during the study period may be considered for inclusion.\n* Study participation by clinical site employees and/or their immediate relatives who reside in the same household.\n* Study participation by more than one subject from the same household.\n* Have any of the following conditions that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the clinical trial: impaired hepatic function including alcohol related liver disease or cirrhosis; history of ocular disturbances, e.g., glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts; any systemic infection; hematological, hepatic, renal, endocrine (except for controlled diabetes mellitus or postmenopausal symptoms or hypothyroidism) disease; gastrointestinal disease; malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma); current neuropsychological condition with or without drug therapy\n* Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude the subject from completing the protocol with completion of the assessments as written.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Treatment Satisfaction Subscales (Interference, Regimen Adaptation, Role Limitations, Sensory Impact, Regimen Difficulties, Burden, Hassle, Regimen Management, and Perceived Relief)Reliability Statistics","description":"Reliability for the nine treatment satisfaction subscales was established through internal consistency statistical analyses \\[Cronbach's alpha (raw and standardized) coefficients were calculated\\].
