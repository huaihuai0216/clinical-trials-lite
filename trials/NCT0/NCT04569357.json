Male and female children aged 7-12 years old inclusive.\n2. Children with verified diagnosis of ADHD.\n3. Presence of all ADHD criteria according to DSM-V (see appendix 1):\n\nA. persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2):\n\n1. Attention deficit: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities:\n\n   * Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or misses details, work is inaccurate).\n   * Often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading).\n   * Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction).\n   * Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses focus and is easily sidetracked).\n   * Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks; difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy, disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).\n   * Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework).\n   * Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities (e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, eyeglasses).\n   * Is often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.\n   * Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g., doing chores, running errands).\n2. Hyperactivity/impulsivity: Six (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational activities. Note. The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to understand tasks or instructions.\n\n   * Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat.\n   * Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require remaining in place).\n   * Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate.\n   * Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly.\n   * Is often \"on the go\" acting as if \"driven by a motor\" (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended time).\n   * Often talks excessively.\n   * Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g., completes people's sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation).\n   * Often has trouble waiting his/her turn (e.g., while waiting in line).\n   * Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people's things without asking or receiving permission).\n\nB. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before age 12 years.\n\nC. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings, (e.g., at home, school or work; with friends or relatives).\n\nD. There is clear evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, school, or work functioning.\n\nE.
