Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (\\>12 hours) or recurrent sustained atrial fibrillation (\\>2 episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting longer than 30 minutes) will be candidates for inclusion. Upon meeting study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and after informed consent, patients will be randomized to either the standard of care (warfarin per protocol) or apixaban arms of the trial. Routine postoperative care after CABG will occur in both groups. Upon discharge, anticoagulation in both groups will be managed by the anticoagulation clinic. Patients will be followed for 30 days after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Strokes","timeFrame":"30 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Apixaban","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Warfarin","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"1.0"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26482512","19878532","23850476","21257002","20570180","26009291","11673357","21870978","19717844","21830957","32476465"],"seeAlso":["http://www.micromedexsolutions.com","http://www.micromedexsolutions.com","http://www.micromedexsolutions.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":28},"commonTop":["Required thoracentesis","required transfusions after anticoagulation while in hospital","Epistaxis requiring intervention","GI bleed requiring endoscopy","Epistaxis not requiring intervention"]}}
