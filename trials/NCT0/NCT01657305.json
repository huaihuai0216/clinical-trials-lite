Difference in time to wound closure was calculated for every individual participant as \\[time taken for wound half treated with Oleogel-S10 to close\\] - \\[time taken for wound half treated with non-adhesive wound dressing to close\\], i.e., results below 0 indicate earlier wound closure of Oleogel-S10 treatment.
