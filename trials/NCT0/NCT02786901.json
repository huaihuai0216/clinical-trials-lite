Be 18 years or older on the date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed and with the capacity to provide voluntary informed consent.\n2. Be able to read, understand, and provide written informed consent on the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved ICF and provide Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization.\n3. Be willing and able to comply with all treatment and follow-up/study procedures.\n4. Be a candidate for routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery (phaco-emulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens \\[IOL\\] implantation, not combined with any other surgery).\n5. In the Investigator's opinion, have potential postoperative pin-holed Snellen visual acuity (VA) of at least 20/200 in the study eye at Visit 1 (Screening) and at least 20/200 in the fellow eye.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Have a severe/serious ocular condition or history/presence of chronic generalized systemic disease that the Investigator feels might increase the risk to the subject or confound the result(s) of the study.\n2. Be a female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n3. Be monocular (fellow eye is nonfunctional or fellow eye's pinhole vision is worse than Snellen 20/200).\n4. Have had ocular surgery (including laser surgery) in the study eye within 3 months or in the fellow eye within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Complete Resolution of Anterior Chamber (AC) Cells at Visit 5 (Postoperative Day 8)","description":"Slit lamp examination was performed.
