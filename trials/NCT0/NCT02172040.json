Adult 40 to 75 years of age\n2. Newly diagnosed hypertension that requires chronic pharmacological therapy. Specifically, the subject must meet both of the following criteria:\n\n   1. Resting systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and ≤179 mmHg (where resting is defined as supine for at least 10 minutes with minimal interaction) at Initial Screening Visit\n   2. SBPday \\>135 mmHg at Baseline Visit (Day 0)\n3. Body Mass Index of 18.5 to 34.9 kg/m2\n4. Healthy (other than hypertension) as determined by the Investigator based on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests\n5. A negative pregnancy test at Screening\n6. Both males and women of child bearing potential agree to use adequate contraceptive methods while on study (from Screening through final study visit)\n7. Able to comprehend and sign an informed consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Resting systolic BP \\>179 mmHg or a resting diastolic BP \\>110 mmHg at Screening (where resting is defined as supine for at least 10 minutes with minimal interaction) or SBP24h \\>169 mmHg or DBP24h \\>110 mmHg at randomization\n2. SBPday ≤135 mmHg at baseline (Day 0)\n3. Weight \\<55 kg\n4. Fragile health\n5. Evidence of clinically significant findings on screening evaluations (clinical, laboratory, and ECG) which, in the opinion of the Investigator would pose a safety risk or interfere with appropriate interpretation of safety data\n6. Current or recent history (within 4 weeks prior to Screening) of a clinically significant bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection\n7. Current clinically significant viral infection\n8. History of malignancy, with the exception of cured basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n9. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Screening\n10. Presence of a malabsorption syndrome possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., Crohn's disease or chronic pancreatitis)\n11. Active peptic ulceration or history of gastrointestinal bleeding\n12. History of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or stroke\n13. Any current cardiovascular disease\n14. History of psychotic disorder\n15. History of alcoholism or drug addiction or current alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and study evaluations\n16. History of any illicit drug use within one year prior to Screening\n17. Positive drug screen at Screening. A positive drug screen for opiates only (with all other drug tests negative) will not be a basis for exclusion if the subject took over-the-counter narcotics as indicated on the product label within 24 hours prior to the drug screen\n18. Current treatment or treatment within 30 days prior to first dose of study drugs with another investigational drug or current enrollment in another clinical trial\n19. Current treatment or treatment within 30 days prior to first dose of study drugs with an NSAID or systemic corticosteroid\n20. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C\n21. Known hypersensitivity to amlodipine or celecoxib\n22. Known hypersensitivity to the inactive ingredients in the over-encapsulated study drugs\n23. Asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioneurotic oedema, urticaria or other allergic type reactions after taking acetylsalicylic acid or NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors\n24. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unable or unlikely to comply with the dosing schedule and study evaluations\n25. Pregnant or lactating\n26. Unable to correctly use ambulatory blood pressure monitor after instruction on its use\n27. Subjects with Child-Pugh Class B or C cirrhosis;\n28. Subjects currently taking a calcium channel blocker for any reason including angina. Subjects will not be withdrawn from these drugs to be enrolled in the trial\n29. Creatinine clearance \\<50 ml/min as estimated by the Cockroft-Gault equation\n30. Known cytochrome P450 2C9 poor metabolizer\n31.
