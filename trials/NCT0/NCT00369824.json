Subjects also are required to agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Female subjects who reach menarche (began menstruating) during the study and therefore become of child-bearing potential are required to agree to follow the same precautions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (up to the Month 12/13 visit), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before and 30 days after each dose of vaccine. Administration of routine vaccines up to 8 days before the first dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window.\n* A woman planning to become pregnant, likely to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions during the study period and up to two months after the last vaccine dose.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women.\n* Previous vaccination against HPV, or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period.\n* previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine\n* Administration of a pre-school booster of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine within the previous five years.\n* Administration of a diphtheria-tetanus booster or tetanus-diphteria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine within the previous five years.\n* Previous vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine or following any other tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid or pertussis-containing vaccine.\n* History of encephalopathy within seven days of administration of a previous dose of pertussis vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable cause.\n* Progressive neurologic disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy.\n* Temperature of \\>= 105°F within 48 hours of receipt of a prior dose of diphteria- tetanu-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, not due to another identifiable cause.\n* Collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of receipt of a prior dose of DTP vaccine.\n* Seizures with or without fever within three days of a prior dose of DTP vaccine.\n* Severe Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid within the previous 10 years.\n* Previous history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment. All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"11 Years","maximumAge":"18
