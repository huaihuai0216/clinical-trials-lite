Vaccination of pre-teens and adolescents, ideally before sexual debut and thus before exposure to oncogenic HPV, is a rational strategy for prevention of cervical cancer, and so HPV vaccination could complement the existing pre-adolescent/adolescents platform. Therefore, this Phase 3b study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of co-administering Boostrix and/or Menactra with GSK Biologicals' HPV vaccine (580299) as compared to the administration of any of the vaccines alone.\n\nThe Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Anti-diphtheria Toxoid (Anti-D) and Anti-tetanus Toxoid (Anti-T) Antibody Concentrations Above 1.0 International Unit Per Milliliter (IU/mL)","timeFrame":"Before and one month after vaccination with Boostrix","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix + Boostrix/Menactra Group","deltaMin":38,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cervarix + Boostrix + Menactra Group","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Boostrix/Cervarix Group","deltaMin":39,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"11 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21817954"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1},"commonTop":["Pain","Headache","Fatigue","Redness","Swelling"]}}
