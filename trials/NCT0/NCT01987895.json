The subjects rate the severity of each item as None, Mild, Moderate, Severe or Very severe, converted to numeric scores from 0 to 4, respectively. The daily domain score is calculated as the mean of the non-missing responses for that domain on that day. A negative value for change from baseline corresponds to an improvement in domain score. The three domains are evaluated in a hierarchical manner, starting with Diarrhea Symptoms, then Abdominal Symptoms, and finally Systemic/Other Symptoms. The least squares means (LSM) are computed on the scores.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.233","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.235","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.623","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.710","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.639","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.689","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Investigator's Assessment of Clinical Response (ICR) Rate at Visit 4 in the Modified Intent-to-treat Population","description":"ICR rate (%) is the percentage of subjects with clinical response assessed as cured according to the investigator's own judgement.
