Patients must provide written informed consent before any study related procedures are performed.\n2. Patients must be 50 years of age or older at Screening/Baseline.\n\n   Study eye:\n3. Active CNV lesions secondary to AMD that affect the central subfield, including retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) with a CNV component, confirmed by presence of active leakage from CNV seen by fluorescein angiography and sequellae of CNV, e.g. pigment epithelial detachment (PED), subretinal hemorrhage or sub-retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) hemorrhage, blocked fluorescence, macular edema.\n4. Intra- and/or subretinal fluid affecting the central subfield of the study eye at Screening/Baseline.\n5. BCVA between 83 and 23 letters, inclusive, in the study eye at Screening/Baseline using early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) at an initial testing distance of 4 meters.\n\nEXCLUSION Criteria:\n\nOcular conditions:\n\n1. Any active intraocular or periocular infection or active intraocular inflammation (e.g. infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, endophthalmitis, infectious blepharitis) in either eye at Screening/Baseline.\n2. Presence of amblyopia, amaurosis or ocular disorders in the fellow eye with BCVA \\< 35 ETDRS letters at Screening (except when due to conditions whose surgery may improve visual acuity, e.g. cataract).\n3. Medical history of intraocular inflammation and/or retinal vascular occlusion within 12 months prior to Screening/Baseline.\n\n   Study eye:\n4. Poor quality of OCT-A and SD-OCT images at Screening/Baseline.\n5. Atrophy or fibrosis involving the center of the fovea in the study eye, as assessed by color fundus photography and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) at Screening/Baseline.\n6. The total area of fibrosis or subretinal blood affecting the foveal center point comprising ≥ 50% of the lesion area in the study eye at Screening/Baseline.\n7. Concomitant conditions or ocular disorders in the study eye, including retinal diseases other than nAMD, that, in the judgment of the investigator, could require medical or surgical intervention during the course of the study to prevent or treat visual loss that might result from that condition, or that limits the potential to gain visual acuity upon treatment with the investigational product.\n8. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the center of the macula in the study eye, e.g. vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) rip/tear scar, laser burn, at the time of Screening that in the investigator's opinion could preclude visual function improvement with treatment.\n9. Current vitreous hemorrhage or history of vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye within 4 weeks prior to Screening/Baseline.\n10. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye defined as IOP \\> 25 mmHg on medication or according to the investigator's judgment at Screening/Baseline.\n11. Aphakia and/or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye at Screening/Baseline.\n\n    Ocular treatments (study eye):\n12. Patient has received any approved or investigational treatment for nAMD (other than vitamin supplements) in the study eye at any time.\n13. Intraocular or periocular use of corticosteroids in the study eye during the 6-month period prior to Screening/Baseline.\n14. Previous penetrating keratoplasty or vitrectomy at any time prior to Screening/Baseline.\n15. History or evidence of the following in the study eye within the 90-day period prior to Screening/Baseline:\n\n    * Intraocular or refractive surgery.\n    * Previous panretinal photocoagulation.\n    * Previous submacular surgery, other surgical intervention or laser treatment for nAMD including photodynamic therapy (PDT).\n\n    Systemic conditions or treatments:\n16. End stage renal disease requiring dialysis or renal transplant.\n17. Systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina or optic nerve (e.g. deferoxamine, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, tamoxifen, phenothiazines and ethambutol) used during the 6-month period prior to Screening/Baseline except temporary use for COVID-19 treatment.\n18. Participation in an investigational drug, biologic, or device study within 30 days or the duration of 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is longer) prior to Screening/Baseline. Note: observational clinical studies solely involving over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets are not exclusionary.\n19. Systemic anti-VEGF therapy at any time.\n20. Stroke or myocardial infarction in the 6-month period prior to Screening/Baseline.\n21. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as a systolic value ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic value ≥ 100 mmHg at Screening/Baseline. (In case there is an elevated blood pressure measurement, it should be repeated after 20 minutes. If the repeat measurement is elevated, then the patient is not eligible to be enrolled into the study).\n22. History of a medical condition (disease, metabolic dysfunction with exception of type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding) that, in the judgment of the investigator, would preclude scheduled study visits, completion of the study, or a safe administration of investigational product.\n23. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ cervical cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.\n24. History of hypersensitivity to any component of the test article, control article, or clinically relevant sensitivity to fluorescein dye, as assessed by the investigator.\n\n    Other:\n25. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test.\n26. Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women less than 1 year postmenopausal or less than 6 weeks since sterilization at Screening/Baseline Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.\n27.
