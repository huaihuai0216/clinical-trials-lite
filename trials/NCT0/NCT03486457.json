The PASI clinical component scores (erythema, induration and scaling) range from 0.0 to 24.0, with higher scores representing increasing severity of psoriasis.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-44.53","spread":"5.553"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.89","spread":"9.335"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-39.91","spread":"4.329"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-14.73","spread":"7.261"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-37.25","spread":"5.331"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-15.94","spread":"8.954"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-63.49","spread":"5.471"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-14.38","spread":"8.993"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-58.71","spread":"4.935"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-29.01","spread":"8.082"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-56.91","spread":"5.575"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-20.13","spread":"9.153"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-61.40","spread":"5.543"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-68.43","spread":"8.911"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-60.47","spread":"6.468"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-69.63","spread":"10.430"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-63.20","spread":"6.088"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-63.89","spread":"9.803"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in BSA at Month 1, 3 and 6 for Participants With Baseline BSA >0%","description":"Assessment of BSA with psoriasis was performed separately for four body regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin), and lower limbs (including buttocks).
