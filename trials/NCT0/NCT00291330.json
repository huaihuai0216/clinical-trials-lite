This trial aims to demonstrate non-inferiority of dabigatran compared with warfarin in patients with acute symptomatic VTE. After achieving non-inferiority, this trial also aims to establish superiority (by means of hierarchical tests) of dabigatran over warfarin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Recurrent Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and Deaths Related to VTE","timeFrame":"For statistical analysis 1: from randomisation to end of post treatment period (ptp), planned to be up to day 224.
