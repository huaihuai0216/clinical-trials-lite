Both LR and rectal indomethacin have shown benefit in preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. Despite this, no study to date has evaluated both of these measures for preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis. It is our hope to evaluate the combination of these two modalities for preventing post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with either modality alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Number of Participants With Acute Pancreatitis After ERCP as Assessed by Worsening Abdominal Pain Plus Either Elevated Amylase or Lipase 3 x Upper Limit of Normal","timeFrame":"30 days after ERCP","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A (NS+Placebo)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"B (NS+IND)","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"C (LR+Placebo)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"D (LR+IND)","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["2070995","22341094","12024166","23896955","17509029","17703388","19098846","23164513","22494121","2409946","18375470","12806612","17203570","12858608","12838216","17383459","21645639","23920031","27816497"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":48},"commonTop":["Acute Renal Failure","Pulmonary Edema","Splenic Laceration"]}}
