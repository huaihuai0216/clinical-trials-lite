The study medication is administered under the tongue as a simple spray and can be self-administered by patients or assisted by their caregivers. Patients are titrated to an effective-dose of fentanyl sublingual spray in the open-label titration period and then proceed to the double-blind randomized period where they randomly receive 7 treatments with fentanyl sublingual spray and 3 treatments with placebo. Patients are treated for up to a total of 6-7 weeks (including both the open-label titration and the double-blind randomized periods).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Summed Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) at 30 Minutes After Dosing (SPID30)","timeFrame":"Baseline (time 0, beginning of each pain episode) through 30 minutes after dosing for each pain episode","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fentanyl Sublingual Spray","deltaMin":640.3,"sd":458.8},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":399.6,"sd":391.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22480131","27020837"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":130},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Somnolence","Dizziness","Oedema peripheral"]}}
