For subjects with 3 or more ART regimens, a regimen history must be provided to the Sponsor for approval. Allowed third antiretroviral agents include LPV/r, ATV+RTV, ATV+COBI (or ATV/COBI FDC), DRV+RTV, DRV + COBI (or DRV/COBI FDC) FPV + RTV, SQV + RTV, ATV (no booster), EFV, RPV, NVP, ETR, RAL or DTG\n* Documented plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \\< 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay). In the preceding 6 months prior to screening, one episode of \"blip\" (HIV-1 RNA \\> 50 and \\< 400 copies/mL) is acceptable, only if HIV-1 RNA is \\< 50 copies/mL immediately before and after the \"blip\".\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at screening visit\n* Individuals will have no evidence of previous virologic failure on a PI+RTV or integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimen (with or without resistance to either class of ARV).\n* All documented historical plasma genotype(s) must not show resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or emtricitabine (FTC), including, but not limited to the presence of reverse transcriptase resistance mutants K65R, K70E, M184V/I, or thymidine analog associated mutations (TAMs) (TAMs are: M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, K219Q/E/N/R). If a historical genotype is not available or subject has 3 or more ART regimens, subject will have proviral genotype analysis prior to Day 1 to confirm absence of archived resistance to TDF or FTC.\n* Adequate renal function defined as having an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥ 30 mL/min as calculated by Cockcroft-Gault (eGFR-CG)\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Have HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL as Defined by the FDA Snapshot Algorithm at Week 24","description":"The percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at Week 24 was analyzed using the snapshot algorithm, which defines a participant's virologic response status using only the viral load at the predefined time point within an allowed window of time, along with study drug discontinuation status.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"93.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"97.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"96.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Have HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL as Defined by the FDA Snapshot Algorithm at Week 12","description":"The percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at week 12 was analyzed using the snapshot algorithm, which defines a participant's virologic response status using only the viral load at the predefined time point within an allowed window of time, along with study drug discontinuation status.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"96.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Have HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL as Defined by the FDA Snapshot Algorithm at Week 48","description":"The percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at week 48 was analyzed using the snapshot algorithm, which defines a participant's virologic response status using only the viral load at the predefined time point within an allowed window of time, along with study drug discontinuation status.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"86.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in CD4+ Cell Count at Week 24","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-28","spread":"161.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":"192.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-23","spread":"201.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in CD4+ Cell Count at Week 48","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-32","spread":"147.1"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":183},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Headache","Arthralgia","Vitamin D deficiency","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}}
