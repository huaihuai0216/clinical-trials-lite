Primary objective #1: Determine the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC in the full study sample with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and cocaine/alcohol use over weeks 1-24.\n\n   * Hypothesis 1: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce higher rates of treatment engagement than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (e.g., MI-IOP).\n   * Hypothesis 2: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce better cocaine/alcohol use outcomes than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only (MI-IOP).\n   * Secondary analysis 1: Among the Non-engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.\n   * Secondary analysis 2: Among the Engaged patients, determine rates of selection of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.\n2. Primary objective #2: Determine whether the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC varies as a function of engagement group, with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes over weeks 1-24.\n\n   * Hypothesis 1: The predicted main effect on retention favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged group.\n   * Hypothesis 2: The predicted main effect on cocaine/alcohol use outcomes favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among those in the Engaged group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Engagement","timeFrame":"weeks 3 - 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MI-PC Non-engaged at 2 Weeks","deltaMin":3.92,"sd":3.27},{"arm":"MI-IOP Non-Engaged at 2 Weeks","deltaMin":3.5,"sd":3.23}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.11"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":227},"commonTop":[]}}
