Eligibility criteria include type 2 diabetes and stage 1-2 chronic kidney disease, defined by a urine albumin-creatinine ratio 30-300 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate â‰¥ 60 mL/min. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with vitamin D3 or placebo, each taken by mouth once daily for a study duration of one year. Study medications will be added to standard treatment, including an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker. We hypothesize that vitamin D3, compared with placebo: (1) is well-tolerated and safe among people with diabetes and kidney disease; (2) results in adequate attained circulating vitamin D levels; and (3) positively affects markers of kidney disease and cardiovascular risk.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Urine Albumin Excretion","timeFrame":"Baseline, 3 months, and one year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cholecalciferol","deltaMin":-21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33184642"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["upper respiratory infection","cough","edema","shoulder pain","decreased mood"]}}
