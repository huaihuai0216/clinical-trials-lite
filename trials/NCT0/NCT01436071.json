Evening clinic visit FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 measurement taken at the Week 12 clinic visit. Pre-dose and pre-rescue albuterol/salbutamol trough FEV1 were measured electronically by spirometry in the evening at the Baseline through Week 12 clinic visits. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the pre-dose value obtained at Visit 2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing, pre-dose, post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing value.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.038","spread":"0.0333"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.157","spread":"0.0330"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour (hr) Periods Over the 12-week Treatment Period","description":"The number of inhalations of rescue bronchodilator, albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol, used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary).
