Infants with herpes viral infection of the CNS that has or has not spread to other parts of the body will be enrolled in this study. All participants will receive treatment in a hospital for 21 days with acyclovir, given intravenously (by a needle inserted into a vein). Participants will then be divided into two groups: those with CNS disease that has or has not spread to the skin, and those whose viral infection has spread and involves the CNS. Both groups will be randomly assigned to receive either oral acyclovir or placebo (inactive substance) for 6 months. Infants in the US and Canada will participate for 5 years. A physical exam, hearing exam, eye exam, and an evaluation of the nervous system will be performed throughout the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Neurologic Impairment at 12 Months as Measured by a Bayley's Neuro-developmental Assessment (Motor Scores).","timeFrame":"At 12 months of life.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Acyclovir","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21991950"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":24},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Otitis media","Herpes simplex virus","Upper respiratory infection"]}}
