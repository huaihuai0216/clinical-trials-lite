This study will explore pathophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea and activity limitation in GOLD stage II COPD and will determine if there is a sound physiological rationale for the use of dual long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) therapy (GSK573719/ GW642444 Inhalation Powder) versus LAMA alone (GSK573719) as treatment for dyspnea and exercise intolerance in this subpopulation. Objectives of this study are to determine if: 1) neuromechanical uncoupling of the respiratory system contributes to exertional dyspnea in milder COPD, and 2) treatment with LABA/LAMA improves dyspnea and exercise endurance compared with LAMA by improving neuromechanical coupling. The investigators hypothesize that: 1) dyspnea is related to excessive dynamic lung hyperinflation, tidal volume restriction and increased ratio of central respiratory neural drive to tidal volume displacement, a measure of neuromechanical uncoupling of the respiratory system, and 2) LABA/LAMA will improve dyspnea and exercise endurance, which will be explained by partial reversal of the above mechanical abnormalities. The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind crossover study and compare the effects of once-daily LABA/LAMA over 4-weeks with LAMA on dyspnea, exercise endurance and ventilatory mechanics in GOLD stage II COPD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Exertional Dyspnea Intensity at Isotime Exercise.","timeFrame":"4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LAMA","deltaMin":3.9,"sd":2.4},{"arm":"LABA/LAMA Combination","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":2.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.090"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["COPD exacerbation","Pancreatitis"]}}
