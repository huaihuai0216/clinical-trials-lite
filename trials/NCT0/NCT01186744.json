psoriasis.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.0","spread":"1.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.6","spread":"2.62"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.0","spread":"0.61"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"18.3","spread":"1.95"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.6","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.5","spread":"2.09"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.9","spread":"0.76"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"7.5","spread":"1.12"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.9","spread":"1.25"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.5","spread":"2.01"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.3","spread":"1.08"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6.3","spread":"1.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.6","spread":"1.50"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.8","spread":"1.97"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.4","spread":"0.46"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6.1","spread":"1.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.2","spread":"0.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.5","spread":"1.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.6","spread":"0.63"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"13.2","spread":"1.40"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.4","spread":"0.82"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.1","spread":"1.92"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.1","spread":"0.90"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"8.4","spread":"1.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.99"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.9","spread":"1.83"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.7","spread":"0.92"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6.7","spread":"0.97"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.0","spread":"1.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.0","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.6","spread":"1.24"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"5.3","spread":"1.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.2","spread":"0.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.9","spread":"1.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.0","spread":"0.85"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"11.1","spread":"1.35"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":"0.68"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.1","spread":"2.33"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.2","spread":"1.72"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6.7","spread":"1.10"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.4","spread":"0.73"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.2","spread":"2.16"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.5","spread":"1.76"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"5.9","spread":"1.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.0","spread":"0.96"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.1","spread":"1.54"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.7","spread":"2.34"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"4.8","spread":"1.16"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.4","spread":"0.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.4","spread":"1.21"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.7","spread":"1.15"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"10.4","spread":"1.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.1","spread":"0.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.5","spread":"1.81"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.6","spread":"0.95"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6.9","spread":"1.06"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.4","spread":"0.38"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.0","spread":"1.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.0","spread":"1.10"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"5.8","spread":"0.92"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":"0.45"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.5","spread":"1.26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.0","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"3.5","spread":"0.64"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean
