Secondarily, the investigators hypothesize there will be secondary improvements in residual mood/anxiety symptoms, and metabolic indices, if impaired (fasting blood glucose and lipids).\n\nThe investigators aim to test these hypotheses by conducting a randomized, placebo controlled, add on treatment trial of Sensoril® (added to existing mood stabilizer treatment) recruiting 60 subjects with DSM IV-TR bipolar disorder for a period of 8 weeks. Measures of cognition, psychopathology and laboratory indices will be utilized for evaluating primary and secondary outcomes, along with safety assessments.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Digit-Span Score at 8 Weeks","timeFrame":"8 week treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sensoril","deltaMin":0.73,"sd":0.19},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.17,"sd":0.18}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24330893"],"seeAlso":["http://www.narsad.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":["diarrhea"]}}
