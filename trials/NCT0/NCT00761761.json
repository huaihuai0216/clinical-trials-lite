Testing procedures and consistency was assured by the same staff-patient dyad, and a TCG staff person had previously trained the research staff (Chengappa et al, 2012). A comprehensive cognitive battery was assessed. Details of these cognitive tests are available at http://www.cogtest.com, and are also described in other studies (Harvey et al, 2007, Lindenmayer et al, 2011, Chengappa et al, 2012). However, the results for Digit span which assesses short term or working memory are presented.\n\nThe raw scores for \"digit span\" ranges from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 8. The Digit Span test measures working memory and the longer the span the better the cognition therefore the higher score is the better outcome.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.73","spread":"0.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.17","spread":"0.18"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Sensoril® Treatment Will Secondarily Improve Any Residual Depressive Symptoms","description":"Depressive symptoms were measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
