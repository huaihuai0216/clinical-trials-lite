The primary hypotheses are that: 1) V114 is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ for the 13 shared serotypes between V114 and Prevnar 13™ based on response rates at 30 days following Dose 3; 2) V114 is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ for the 2 unique V114 serotypes based on the response rate of the 2 unique V114 serotypes compared with the lowest response rate of any of the shared serotypes in Prevnar 13™, excluding serotype 3, at 30 days following Dose 3; 3) V114 is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ for the 13 shared serotypes based on anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPs) serotype-specific immunoglobulin g (IgG) geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at 30 days following Dose 3; 4) V114 is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ for the 2 unique V114 serotypes based on the anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG GMCs of the 2 unique V114 serotypes compared with the lowest IgG GMC of any of the shared serotypes in Prevnar 13™, excluding serotype 3, at 30 days following Dose 3; 5) V114 is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ for the 13 shared serotypes between V114 and Prevnar 13™ based on anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days following Dose 4; and 6) V114 is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ for the 2 unique V114 serotypes based on anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG GMCs of the 2 unique V114 serotypes compared with the lowest IgG GMC of any of the shared serotypes in Prevnar 13, excluding serotype 3, at 30 days following Dose 4.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Solicited Injection-Site Adverse Events (AEs) in V114 Versus Prevnar 13™","timeFrame":"Up to 14 days after each vaccination with either V114 or Prevnar 13™","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V114","deltaMin":69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevnar 13™","deltaMin":69.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.039"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.836"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.235"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.260"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"42 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":81,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36621410","37846456"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":88,"n":858},"commonTop":["Irritability","Somnolence","Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Decreased appetite"]}}
