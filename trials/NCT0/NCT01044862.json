The central hypothesis is that, in infertile ovulatory women undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) and intrauterine insemination (IUI), the use of aromatase inhibitors (AI) will stimulate the ovaries sufficiently to produce no reduction in the rate of pregnancy, while significantly reducing the numbers of multiple gestational pregnancies that result from stimulation with clomiphene citrate (CC) or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The rationale for the proposed research is that reduction of multiple pregnancy rates could significantly reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost of healthcare for these individuals and society.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Multiple Gestation Rate Following Recruitment of Multiple Follicular Development With an AI, as Compared to CC and FSH.","timeFrame":"Participants were followed for the duration of their treatment and, if pregnant through 6 weeks post-delivery, up to 66 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aromatase Inhibitors (AI)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Clomiphene Citrate (CC)","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39672366","38204957","35386508","35125179","34180998","33190149","32972733","32883514","32192596","30982604","30085177","30085176","29778387","29767754","29102040","28089575","27402910","26949110","26413816","26398071","26354094","25707331"],"seeAlso":["http://c2s2.yale.edu/rmn/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":291},"commonTop":["Headache","Abdominal Bloating","Hot Flashes","Breast Pain","Injection Site Reaction"]}}
