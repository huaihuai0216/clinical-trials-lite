The study will compare 2 different methods (assays) for measuring the amount of study drug, the chromogenic substrate assay per European Pharmacopeia (CS/EP) with the classical assay (Chromogenic Substrate Adjusted, CS/ADJ). During one six month period patients will receive the study drug where the dose has been measured using the\" (CS/EP) and during the other six months period the dose will be measured based on the Chromogenic Substrate Adjusted assay CS/ADJ)","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part A - Area Under the Drug Concentration-time Curve (AUC)","timeFrame":"Samples taken at pre-injection, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24, 30 and 48 hours post injection.
