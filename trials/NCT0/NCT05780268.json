Highly effective methods of contraception (less than 1% failure rate) include, but are not limited to:\n\n* combination oral contraceptives\n* implanted contraceptives\n* intrauterine devices\n\nEffective methods of contraception include, but are not limited to:\n\n* diaphragms and cervical caps with spermicide\n* cervical sponges\n* condoms with spermicide\n\nNOTE:\n\n* Use of male and female condoms as a double barrier method is not considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these barrier methods are combined.\n* Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not an effective or acceptable method of contraception.\n* Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Participants not of reproductive potential are eligible without requiring the use of a contraceptive method. Participant-reported history is acceptable documentation of surgical sterilization and menopause. Participants with pregnant partners should use condoms during vaginal intercourse through 90 days after investigational agent administration. Participants should refrain from sperm donation through 90 days after investigational agent administration. NOTE: Reproductive potential is defined as patients who have reached menarche, who have not been post-menopausal for at least 12 consecutive months with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) â‰¥ 40 IU/ml or 24 consecutive months if an FSH is not available, who have not undergone surgical sterilization, who do not have other clinical condition that could induce amenorrhea, who are not taking medications such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotropin releasing hormone, antiestrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or chemotherapy that could induce amenorrhea. Individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause (e.g. Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Sustained Recovery","description":"Sustained recovery defined as being discharged from the index hospitalization, followed by being alive and home for 14 consecutive days prior to Day 90.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"144","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"136","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With an Ordinal Outcome on Day 5","description":"Ordinal outcome with 7 mutually exclusive categories","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"22","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"33","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"51","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"35","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Died From All Causes","description":"All-cause mortality","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With a Safety Outcome Through Day 5","description":"Death, SAE, clinical organ failure, serious infections, or Grade 3 or 4 event through Day 5","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"45","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With a Safety Outcome Through Day 28","description":"Death, SAE, clinical organ failure, serious infections, or Grade 3 or 4 event through Day 28","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"42","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With a Safety Outcome Through Day 90","description":"Death, SAE, clinical organ failure, serious infections through Day 90","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"45","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"41","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":163},"commonTop":["Dyspnoea","Fatigue","Hypotension","Mental status changes","Respiratory failure"]}}}
