Prior hormonal therapy will not be counted as a non-platinum regimen.\n* Must have had at least a 6-month disease-free period following prior treatment with the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy and achieved a response.\n* For the last chemotherapy course prior to study entry, patients must have received a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimen and have achieved a CR or PR (as defined by RECIST) and/or a GCIG CA-125 response.\n* Have sufficient archival tumor tissue for analysis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of prior cancer except for non-melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer curatively \\> 3 years ago, curatively treated solid tumor (\\>5 years ago without evidence of recurrence), and synchronous endometrial cancer (Stage 1A) with ovarian cancer.\n* Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor, including rucaparib. Patients who received prior iniparib are eligible.\n* Untreated or symptomatic central nervous system metastases.\n* Pre-existing duodenal stent and/or any gastrointestinal disorder or defect that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with absorption of study drug.\n* Required drainage of ascites during the final 2 cycles of their last platinum-based regimen and/or during the period between the last dose of chemotherapy of that regimen and randomization to maintenance treatment in this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Disease Progression According to RECIST Version 1.1, as Assessed by the Investigator, or Death From Any Cause (Investigator Progression Free Survival as Per invPFS)","description":"Progression-free survival by Investigator (invPFS) is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression, according to RECIST v1.1 criteria as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
