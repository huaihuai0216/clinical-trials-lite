Written informed consent, and assent when applicable for study participation must be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed (local regulations are to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children and parent\\[s\\]/guardian\\[s\\]) and according to international guidelines and/or applicable local guidelines.\n2. Female and male aged 12 to 75 years, inclusively, at the time of Visit 1. For those patients, who are 17 on the day of Visit 1 but will turn 18 after this day, will be considered an adolescent for the purposes of this trial.\n3. History of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring treatment with medium-to-high dose ICS (\\>250μg fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose) and a LABA, for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n4. Additional maintenance asthma controller medications that are locally approved in a country for the treatment of asthma (e.g., leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), tiotropium, chromone, theophylline, oral corticosteroid), and have been used for at least 30 days prior to Visit 1 are allowed.\n5. At least 2 documented asthma exacerbations in the 12 months prior to the date informed consent, and assent when available, during the treatment of medium-to-high dose ICS-LABA that required use of a systemic corticosteroid or a temporary increase from the patient's usual maintenance dose of oral corticosteroid. For patients who are re-screened within 30 days of their screen failure date, the calculation of the 12 month period should be done from the original informed consent, and assent when applicable date.\n6. Documented post-bronchodilator (post-BD) reversibility in FEV1 of \\>12% and \\>200 mL in FEV1 within 12 months prior to Visit 1. If historical documentation is not available, reversibility must be demonstrated and documented at Visit 2.\n7. Fulfilment of at least 1 of the following conditions over the 7 days prior to randomization:\n\n   * \\>2 days with a daytime or night time symptoms score \\>1\n   * Rescue Short-acting β2 agonist (SABA) use on \\>2 days\n   * ≥1 nocturnal awakening due to asthma\n8. Pre-bronchodilator (Pre-BD) FEV1 of \\<80% predicted (\\<90% predicted for patients aged 12 to 17 years) at Visit 2.\n9. ACQ-6 score \\> = 1.5 at Visit 2.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known history of clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma (e.g., active lung infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other than asthma, that are associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g,. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome).\n2. Known history of any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the opinion of the Investigator and could:\n\n   * Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study\n   * Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations\n   * Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study.\n3. Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication within 30 days prior to the date informed consent, and assent when applicable, is obtained or during the screening period.\n4. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs, haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening period, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study.\n5. Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of \\> 10 pack-years.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Annual Asthma Exacerbation Rate in Patients on Medium to High-dose ICS-LABA With Uncontrolled Asthma for Baseline Eosinophils >=300/uL","description":"Annual asthma exacerbation rate over the 48-week treatment period among benralizumab and placebo groups","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.49","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.88","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline at Week 48 in Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (L) Value for Patients on Medium to High-dose ICS-LABA With Uncontrolled Asthma and Baseline Eosinophils >=300/uL","description":"Change from baseline at Week 48 in Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (L)","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.333","spread":"0.4499"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.103","spread":"0.4841"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline at Week 48 in Total Asthma Symptom Score for for Patients on Medium to High-dose ICS-LABA With Uncontrolled Asthma and Baseline Eosinophils >=300/uL","description":"Daytime and nighttime symptoms are reported using a response scale ranging from 0 to 3 where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms.
