has taken no inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene receptor antagonist medication whatsoever over the past 6 months), then one of the following criteria must be met:\n\n  * Daytime asthma symptoms more than two days per week (average over the past 4 weeks),\n  * At least one nighttime awakening from asthma (over the past 4 weeks),\n  * Two or more asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids in the previous 6 months,\n  * Four or more wheezing episodes in the previous 12 months.\n* If the child is currently taking long-term asthma controller therapy (meaning that the child has taken daily or intermittent/as-needed inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene receptor antagonist over the past 6 months), then one of the following criteria must be met:\n\n  * Taking inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene receptor antagonist for more than 3 months (or more than 90 days) out of the previous 6 months (or 180 days),\n  * Daytime asthma symptoms more than two days per week (average over the past 4 weeks),\n  * More than one nighttime awakening from asthma (over the past 4 weeks),\n  * Two or more asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids in the previous 12 months,\n  * Four or more wheezing episodes in the previous 12 months.\n* Up to date with immunizations, including varicella (unless the subject has already had clinical varicella).\n* Willingness to provide informed consent by the child's parent or guardian.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Allergic reaction to the study medications or any component of the study drugs, including (but not limited to) urticaria, rash, angioedema, or hypotension following delivery,\n* Chronic medical disorders that could interfere with drug metabolism/excretion (for instance chronic hepatic, biliary, or renal disease),\n* Chronic medical disorders that may increase the risk of drug-related injury, including (but not limited to):\n\n  * Osteogenesis imperfecta (increased risk of bone demineralization/fracture with corticosteroid therapy),\n  * Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, clotting disorders, or Factor deficiency (increased risk of bleeding with corticosteroid therapy),\n  * G6PD deficiency (increased risk of hemolytic anemia with acetaminophen use),\n  * Phenylketonuria (potential for aspartame exposure with study interventions),\n  * Seizure disorder treated with anticonvulsants (risk of acetaminophen toxicity with carbamazepine), or\n  * History of clotting disorders or Factor deficiency (increased risk of bleeding with corticosteroids),\n* Co-morbid disorders associated with wheezing including (but not limited to) immune deficiency disorders, cystic fibrosis, aspiration, clinically-relevant gastroesophageal reflux, tracheomalacia, congenital airway anomalies (clefts, fistulas, slings, rings), bronchiectasis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and/or history of premature birth before 35 weeks gestation,\n* Significant developmental delay/failure to thrive, defined as 5th percentile for height and/or weight or crossing of two major percentile lines during the last year for age and sex,\n* History of a near-fatal asthma exacerbation requiring intubation or assisted ventilation,\n* No primary medical caregiver (e.g., a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, physician, or group medical practice such as a hospital-based clinic) whom the subject can contact for primary medical care,\n* Three or more hospitalizations in the previous 12 months for wheezing or respiratory illnesses,\n* Treatment with 5 or more courses of systemic corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular or intravenous) in the past 6 months,\n* Current use of higher than step 2 NAEPP asthma guideline therapy\n* If receiving allergy shots, change in the dose within the past 3 months.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"59
