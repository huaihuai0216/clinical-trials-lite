Acute bacterial infection(including TB) would exclude from enrolment until the infection had been appropriately treated and resolved.\n* Diabetes mellitus.\n* Idiopathic hypercalcuria.\n* Lack of chicken pox immunity and refusal to undergo immunization.\n* Evidence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy at screening assessment (one to three months prior to the baseline visit). Asymptomatic cardiac abnormality on investigation would not be an exclusion.\n* Current or previous treatment (greater than four consecutive weeks of oral therapy) with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive treatments for DMD or other recurrent indications (e.g., asthma), unless approved by FOR-DMD Team (i.e., concurrent participation in another allowed DMD trial).\n* Inability to take tablets, as assessed by the site investigator by the end of the screening period (the screening period ranges from one to three months prior to the baseline visit).\n* Allergy/sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations including lactose and/or sucrose intolerance.\n* Severe behavioral problems, including severe autism.\n* Previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings or laboratory abnormalities that could affect safety, make it unlikely that treatment and follow up will be correctly completed or impair the assessment of study results, in the judgment of the site investigator.\n* Weight of less than 13 kilograms.\n* Exposure to any investigational drug currently or within 3 months prior to start of study treatment.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"4 Years","maximumAge":"7 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Forced Vital Capacity","description":"Forced vital capacity was measured during a spirometry test.
