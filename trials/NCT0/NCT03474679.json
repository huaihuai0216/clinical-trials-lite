In case of inability to taper the dose to less than or equal to (\\<=)0.25 mg/kg/day or \\<=0.5 mg/kg every other day (prednisolone doses) due to recurrence or progression of cGVHD manifestations, it is considered as steroid-dependent disease if the lowest tapering dose of the second occasion is equal or higher than the lowest tapering dose of the first occasion; b) Refractory disease, defined as, when cGVHD manifestations progress despite the use of a regimen containing glucocorticoid (prednisolone at \\>=1 mg/kg/day for at least 1 week) or persist without improvement despite continued treatment with glucocorticoid (prednisolone at \\>=0.5 mg/kg/day or 1 mg/kg every other day) for at least 4 weeks\n* Participants must be receiving baseline systemic glucocorticoid therapy for cGVHD at study entry. The dose of steroids must be stable for 14 days prior to starting ibrutinib\n* At the time of trial enrollment, participants may be receiving other immunosuppressive therapies in addition to glucocorticoids. Immunosuppressant doses must be stable for 14 days prior to starting ibrutinib\n* Clinically stable or worsening cGVHD for a minimum of 14 days between screening and Day 1 cGVHD response assessment\n* Karnofsky or Lansky (participants less than \\[\\<\\]16 years) performance status \\>=60\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Active acute graft versus host disease (GVHD)\n* More than 3 previous systemic treatments for cGVHD. Treatment with glucocorticoids is considered a treatment for cGVHD and should be included in determining the number of previous treatments\n* History of treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (example \\[e.g.\\] imatinib), purine analogs, or other cancer chemotherapy in the 4 weeks prior to starting ibrutinib. Participants may have received ibrutinib pre-transplant for other reasons besides cGVHD such as for the treatment of leukemia or lymphoma\n* History of treatment with monoclonal T and B cell antibodies in the 8 weeks prior to starting ibrutinib\n* Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of ibrutinib","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Response Rate (ORR)","description":"ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the absence of new therapy for chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) and absence of progression of underlying disease or death based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Project Criteria (2014).
