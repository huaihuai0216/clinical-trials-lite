CTTI is preferable to RPP because the latter overestimates the contribution of systolic BP to cardiac work (the formula intrinsically assumes maximum SBP throughout the entire heart period \\[RR interval\\]). In contrast, CTTI represents cardiac work during the actual systolic time interval (STI, the period of active contraction, which is about 320 ms, inversely related to HR). Thus, CTTI = \\[mean systolic BP during STI, mmHg\\] x \\[STI/RR\\] x \\[HR, beats/min\\] and is expressed as \"CTTI units\" or as \"mmHg\\*beats/min\". Mean resting CTTI for SBP 150, HR 60 = about 2500 units (corresponding RPP = 9000 units). In this crossover study, the principal dependent variable is the mean within-subjects difference in supine CTTI between valsartan and carvedilol CR after 4 weeks of each treatment.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2447","spread":"547"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2500","spread":"561"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Heart Rate (Beats/Min)","description":"Hemodynamic variable (cardiac rate)","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"75","spread":"17"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"68","spread":"14"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Stroke Volume (SV)","description":"Hemodynamic variable (volume pumped per heart beat) in mL per beat.
