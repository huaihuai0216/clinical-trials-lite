A breakthrough overt HE episode was defined as an increase of Conn score from Grade 0 or 1 to ≥2, or an increase in Conn and asterixis score of 1 grade each for those participants who entered the study with a Conn score of 0. Participants who completed the study and did not experience a breakthrough overt HE episode were censored at the time of their 6-month visit. Participants who terminated early for reasons other than a breakthrough overt HE episode were contacted at 6 months from randomization to determine if they had experienced a breakthrough overt HE event or other outcome. Participants without breakthrough overt HE were censored at the time of last contact or death, whichever was earlier. The number of events of a first breakthrough overt HE episode during the treatment interval is presented.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time To First HE-related Hospitalization","description":"Time to first HE-related hospitalization is defined as the duration (number of days) between the first dose of study drug and the date of first HE-related hospitalization.
