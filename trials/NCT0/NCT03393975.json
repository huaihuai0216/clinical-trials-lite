The Peds-QL total score consists of all 23 items of all domains. This modular instrument uses a 5-point scale: from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. As per planned analysis, for the prophylaxis cohorts data for this outcome measure were collected and reported by categorizing as per Prophylaxis Periods and per age groups, 2 to \\< 5 years, 5 to \\< 8 years, 8 to \\< 13 years, and 13 to \\< 18 years, for both on demand and prophylaxis cohorts.","classes":[{"categories":[]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.0000","spread":"47.14045"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.3810","spread":"47.14045"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24.4048","spread":"49.66583"}]}]},{"categories":[]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29.3478","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-16.3043","spread":"NA"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.5217","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32.6087","spread":"NA"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.9348","spread":"19.21486"}]}]},{"categories":[]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.1739","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.2174","spread":"13.83470"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.6957","spread":"23.05783"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.0870","spread":"NA"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.7971","spread":"7.39876"}]}]},{"categories":[]},{"categories":[]},{"categories":[]},{"categories":[]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Resource Utilization: Annualized Length of Hospital Stay for Acute TTP Events for Prophylaxis Cohorts","description":"The annualized number of days participants stayed in hospital for acute TTP events were assessed.
