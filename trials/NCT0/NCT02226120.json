Written informed consent for the extension must be obtained before any assessment is performed.\n2. Patients who have completed PARADIGM-HF (protocol CLCZ696B2314) and are able to be safely enrolled into the open-label trial as judged by the investigator.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 half-lives of enrollment, whichever is longer\n2. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to any of the study drugs, drugs of similar chemical classes, ACEIs, ARBs, or NEP inhibitors as well as known or suspected contraindications to LCZ696\n3. Known history of angioedema\n4. Requirement of simultaneous treatment with both ACEIs and ARBs\n5. Current acute decompensated HF (exacerbation of chronic HF manifested by signs and symptoms that may require intravenous therapy)\n6. Symptomatic hypotension and/or a SBP \\< 100 mmHg at Visit 1 (screening)\n7. Estimated GFR \\< 30 mL/min/1.73m\\^2 as measured by the simplified MDRD formula at Visit 1 (screening)\n8. Presence of bilateral renal artery stenosis\n9. Serum potassium \\> 5.2 mmol/L at Visit 1 (screening)\n10. Evidence of hepatic disease as determined by any one of the following: AST or ALT values exceeding 3 x ULN at Visit 1, history of hepatic encephalopathy, history of esophageal varices, or history of portacaval shunt\n11. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women\n12. Women of child-bearing potential\n13. Any condition, not identified in the protocol, that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to prevent the patient from safely tolerating LCZ696 or complying with the requirements of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Deaths as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of LCZ696","description":"The primary assessments for safety were the reporting of angioedema, AEs suspected to be related to LCZ696, AEs leading to study drug discontinuation and serious adverse events (SAE) including death. The assessment of safety were based primarily on the frequency of adverse events of special interest, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and serious adverse events suspected by the investigators to be related to LCZ696 for the Safety set.
