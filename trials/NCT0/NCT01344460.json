Two to three visits to the study doctor will be required.\n\nThis study will compare the diagnostic results of Gadobutrol enhanced MRA images with MRA images taken without contrast agent using images from a CTA as the standard of reference, which may have been performed up to 60 days prior to enrolment. If a CTA has not been performed in this prior time period, a CTA is required for the study.\n\nMRA and CTA images will be collected for an independent review (blinded read).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Assessable Vascular Segments Using Gadobutrol-Enhanced MRA and Unenhanced MRA","timeFrame":"Images were taken pre-injection and post-injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gadobutrol-enhanced MRA","deltaMin":95.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Unenhanced MRA","deltaMin":77.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Brazil","Colombia","Czechia","France","Germany","Poland","South Korea","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":315},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache"]}}
