History or evidence of any of the following diseases:\n\n   * congenital thrombotic disease (eg, antithrombin deficiency, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, or coagulation factor \\[Factor V Leiden\\] mutation)\n   * acquired thrombotic disease (eg, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, hyperhomocysteinemia, or increased factor VIII)\n   * Budd Chiari syndrome.\n9. Portal vein thrombosis based on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 28 days prior to randomization or a history of portal vein thrombosis.\n10. Absence of hepatopetal blood flow in the main trunk of the portal vein as demonstrated by Doppler ultrasonography within 28 days prior to randomization.\n11. History or evidence of disease associated with a risk of bleeding (e.g., coagulation factor deficiency or von Willebrand factor deficiency).\n12. Bleeding score at randomization ≥ Grade 2 according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale.\n13. Any of the following drugs or therapies within 90 days prior to randomization:\n\n    * anticancer drugs\n    * interferon preparations\n    * radiation therapy\n    * exsanguination\n    * other thrombopoietin receptor agonist\n    * any investigational agent.\n14. Any invasive procedure within 14 days prior to randomization.\n15. Blood transfusion within 14 days prior to randomization.\n16. Prior treatment with lusutrombopag (S-888711).\n17. Pregnancy or lactation.\n18. Known or suspected ongoing, active alcohol or substance abuse. Patients with a recent history who the investigator feels are able to comply with the study procedures and medications will be allowed to participate.\n19.
