Aldesleukin may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combining aldesleukin with vaccine therapy is more effective than aldesleukin alone in treating melanoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Best Response Rate (Partial Response [PR] + Complete Response [CR])","timeFrame":"Up to 12 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Aldesleukin)","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (gp100 Antigen in Montanide IDA-51 and Aldesleukin)","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.035"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21631324"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":93},"commonTop":["Blood or bone marrow","Hepatic","General","Metabolic or laboratory-testing result","Constitutional symptoms"]}}
