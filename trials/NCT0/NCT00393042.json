The ADHD-RS evaluates the severity of the participant's ADHD symptoms and includes two subscales: Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity. Both subscale scores range from 0 to 27 with a higher score representing more severe symptoms. The subscales are summed to calculate the total score which can range from 0 to 54.
