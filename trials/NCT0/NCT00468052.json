To provide pain relief, i.e. analgesia, current practice relies on opioids , e.g., morphine or fentanyl. These narcotics are known to depress respiration and to increase the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting. These side effects are worrisome in this patient cohort. An alternative medication, dexmedetomidine, may have an opiate sparing effect and has a high safety profile in adults as well as in sedation in children. The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous dexmedetomidine given as an infusion during general anesthesia for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy reduces the incidence and severity of emergence agitation, improves analgesia and reduces nausea and vomiting in the 60 minutes following surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Emergence Agitation and Pain","timeFrame":"On arrival to PACU and 2 hours postoperatively","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fentanyl (F) Group","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dexmedetomidine","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".001"},{"comp":"OG001","p":".001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16879517"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":61},"commonTop":[]}}
