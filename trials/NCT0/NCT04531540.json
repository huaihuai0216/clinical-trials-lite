They are especially interested in skin irritations or allergic skin reactions. The study plans to enroll about 225 female or male participants with the age 18 - 79 years. The antifungal test cream will be applied on the back between the shoulder blades of the participants and covered by a special dressing patch. This will be repeated 3 times a week for the first 3 weeks of this study applying the cream on the same area of the back. At each visit the skin will be investigated for redness, dryness and other reactions. After a rest period of two weeks the test cream will be applied on the same skin area as before and on a second new skin area nearby. After 2 and 4 days the two skin areas will again be investigated for redness, dryness and other reactions.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Irritation Response Evaluation According to Erythema Scoring Scale During Induction Phase - All Enrolled Subjects","timeFrame":"After 4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Repeated Insult Patch Test","deltaMin":2182,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":225},"commonTop":["Headache","Renal calculi","Enterocolitis infectious","Sinusitis","Urinary Tract Infection"]}}
