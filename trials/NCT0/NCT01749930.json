The secondary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of BOL-303259-X QD to timolol maleate 0.5% BID. This assessment will be performed if the non-inferiority of BOL-303259-X QD to timolol maleate 0.5% BID is determined. An open label safety phase will be conducted at the end of Visit 6 (3 months) where all participants will receive BOL-303259-X QD for an additional 3 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean IOP","timeFrame":"8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at Visit 4 (Week 2), Visit 5 (Week 6), and Visit 6 (Month 3)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BOL-303259-X","deltaMin":19.17,"sd":3.748},{"arm":"Timolol","deltaMin":19.61,"sd":3.092}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.216"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27210275","29194198"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":279},"commonTop":["Conjunctival hyperemia","Eye irritation","Eye pain"]}}
