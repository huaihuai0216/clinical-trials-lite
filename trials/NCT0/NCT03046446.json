Each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included. Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.\n\nKOOS was administered at study visits from BL/Day 1 through week 52.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"28.92","spread":"15.872"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"58.06","spread":"22.049"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"55.34","spread":"21.791"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.08","spread":"20.860"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.47","spread":"17.270"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54.85","spread":"20.927"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"50.92","spread":"20.781"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.52","spread":"23.274"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":208},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Muscle spasms","Back pain","Joint swelling"]}}}
