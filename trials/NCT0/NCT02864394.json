The primary hypotheses of this study are that pembrolizumab (MK-3475) prolongs overall survival (OS) and that pembrolizumab prolongs progression-free survival (PFS), compared to docetaxel in participants with PD-L1 positive tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Positive (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS] ≥50%) Tumors","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 36 months (through Final Analysis cut-off date of 09-Sep-2019)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":12.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Docetaxel","deltaMin":10.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1276"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["37141294"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26058&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":77,"n":213},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Alopecia","Decreased appetite","Hypoalbuminaemia","Cough"]}}
