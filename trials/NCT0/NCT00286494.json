The subject should have received the thiazolidinedione therapy (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone) either alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea for at least the 3 months prior to Screening and must have been on a stable dose for all their antidiabetic treatments for at least the month prior to Screening.\n* No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than a thiazolidinedione alone or in combination with either metformin or a sulfonylurea within the 3 months prior to Screening. (Exception: if a subject has received other antidiabetic therapy for less than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)\n* Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2\n* Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL. (If this screening criterion is not met, the subject still qualifies if C-peptide is greater than or equal to 1.5 ng per mL after a challenge test.)\n* Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive.\n* If regular use of other, non-excluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at least the 4 weeks prior to Screening. However, as needed use of prescription or over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure less than or equal to 110 mm Hg.\n* Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g per dL for males and greater than or equal to10 g per dL for females.\n* Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.\n* Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg per dL.\n* Thyroid-stimulating hormone level less than or equal to the upper limit of the normal range and the subject is clinically euthyroid.\n* Neither pregnant nor lactating.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must be practicing adequate contraception. Adequate contraception must be practiced for the duration of participation in the study.\n* Able and willing to monitor their own blood glucose concentrations with a home glucose monitor.\n* No major illness or debility that in the investigator's opinion prohibits the subject from completing the study.\n* Able and willing to provide written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Urine albumin to creatinine ratio of greater than 1000 μg per mg at Screening. If elevated, the subject may be rescreened within 1 week.\n* History of cancer, other than squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, that has not been in full remission for at least 5 years prior to Screening. (A history of treated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II is allowed.)\n* History of laser treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy within the 6 months prior to Screening.\n* History of treated diabetic gastric paresis.\n* New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure regardless of therapy. Currently treated subjects who are stable at Class I or II are candidates for the study.\n* History of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to Screening\n* History of any hemoglobinopathy that may affect determination of glycosylated hemoglobin.\n* History of infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus.\n* History of a psychiatric disorder that will affect the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n* History of angioedema in association with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor inhibitors.\n* History of alcohol or substance abuse within the 2 years prior to Screening.\n* Receipt of any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to Screening or a history of receipt of an investigational antidiabetic drug within the 3 months prior to Screening.\n* Prior treatment in an investigational study of alogliptin.\n* Excluded Medications:\n\n  * Treatment with antidiabetic agents other than a thiazolidinedione alone or in combination with either metformin or a sulfonylurea is not allowed within the 3 months prior to Screening and through the completion of the end-of-treatment/early termination procedures.\n  * Treatment with weight-loss drugs, any investigational antidiabetics, or oral or systemically injected glucocorticoids is not allowed from 3 months prior to randomization through the completion of the end-of-treatment/early termination procedures. Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n\nSubjects must not take any medications, including over-the-counter products, without first consulting with the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80
