For the open-label part of the study the objective is to estimate the efficacy and safety of BI 10773 when given for 24 weeks in patients with T2DM with very poor glycaemic control.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) After 24 Weeks","timeFrame":"Baseline and day 169","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.06,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Empagliflozin10 mg","deltaMin":-0.66,"sd":0.06},{"arm":"Empagliflozin 25 mg","deltaMin":-0.77,"sd":0.06},{"arm":"Sitagliptin 100 mg","deltaMin":-0.65,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Empagliflozin 25 mg OL","deltaMin":-3.1,"sd":0.22}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":124,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","China","Germany","India","Ireland","Japan","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38770818","35472672","27316632","24622369"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":229},"commonTop":["Hyperglycaemia","Nasopharyngitis","Dyslipidaemia","Urinary tract infection","Diarrhoea"]}}
