No childbearing potential is defined as post-menopausal for at least 1 year, surgical sterilisation at least 3 months before entering the study, or hysterectomy.\n* Have both the time and the ability to complete the study and comply with study instructions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous treatment with any serotype of BTX.\n* Any prior treatment with permanent fillers in the upper face including the glabellar lines area.\n* Any prior treatment with any dermal fillers in the upper face including the glabellar lines area within the past 3 years and/or skin abrasions/resurfacing (whatever the interventional technic used) within the past 5 years, or photo rejuvenation or skin/vascular laser intervention within the past 12 months.\n* Any planned facial cosmetic surgery during the study.\n* A history of eyelid blepharoplasty or brow lifts within the past 5 years.\n* An inability to substantially reduce glabellar lines by physically spreading them apart or lack of capacity to frown.\n* An active infection or other skin problems in the upper face including the glabellar lines area (e.g. acute acne lesions or ulcers).\n* Use of concomitant therapy, which in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with the evaluation of the safety or efficacy of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), including medications affecting bleeding disorders (antiplatelet agents and/or anticoagulants given for treatment or prevention of cardio/cerebro vascular diseases).\n* Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women who are planning a pregnancy during the study, or believe they may be pregnant at the start of the study. Throughout the course of the study, women of childbearing potential must use a reliable form of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptives for more than 12 consecutive weeks, or spermicide and condoms).\n* Treatment with an experimental drug or use of any experimental device within 30 days prior to the start of the study and during the conduct of the study.\n* Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of BTX-A-HAC NG.\n* Clinically diagnosed significant anxiety disorder, or any other significant psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression) that might interfere with the subject's participation in the study.\n* Use of medications that affect neuromuscular transmission, such as curare-like non depolarising agents, lincosamides, polymyxins, anticholinesterases and aminoglycoside antibiotics, within the past 30 days.\n* A history of facial nerve palsy.\n* Marked facial asymmetry, ptosis, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, or thick sebaceous skin.\n* The presence of any other condition (e.g. neuromuscular disorder or other disorder that could interfere with neuromuscular function), laboratory finding or circumstance that, in the judgement of the investigator, might increase the risk to the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Percentage of Responders at Day 29 Cycle 1 as Measured by Investigator's Live Assessment (ILA) of Glabellar Lines at Maximum Frown: DB Period","description":"The appearance of glabellar lines at maximum frown was assessed in the DB period at the Day 29 follow-up visit using the ILA, a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity.
