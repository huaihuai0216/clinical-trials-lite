This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat following a switch from erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) in Japanese HD subjects with renal anemia who are currently treated with ESA. The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of daprodustat to darbepoetin alfa. This study is a 52-week, Phase III, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 58 weeks including screening and follow-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Hemoglobin (Hgb) During the Primary Efficacy Evaluation Period (Weeks 40 to 52)","timeFrame":"Weeks 40 to 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Daprodustat","deltaMin":10.89,"sd":0.062},{"arm":"Darbepoetin Alfa","deltaMin":10.83,"sd":0.06}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32723804","36005278"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":136},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Shunt stenosis","Contusion","Vomiting"]}}
