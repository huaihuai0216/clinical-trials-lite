For lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), a second line treatment option that is increasingly necessary due to infant drug resistance, this dosing is often complicated and impractical in busy clinical settings. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has released a simplified dosing table based on infant weight bands. This study will evaluate the absorption, safety, and tolerance of LPV/r in infants when dosed according to the new WHO guidelines.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Lopinovir/Ritonavir Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC0-24)","timeFrame":"Measured at 4 weeks of treatment prior to the observed dose and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lopinavir/Ritonavir","deltaMin":196,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Weeks","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States","Brazil","South Africa","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":97},"commonTop":["Blood sodium decreased","Blood bicarbonate decreased","Cough","Rhinorrhoea","Pyrexia"]}}
