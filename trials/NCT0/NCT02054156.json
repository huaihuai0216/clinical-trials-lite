Specimens of blood and sputum or throat swabs will be taken during the study along with pulmonary function testing. Participants will receive initial treatment with TIS followed additional treatment with TIS if quarterly respiratory cultures are positive for Pa in addition to either azithromycin or placebo for 18 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to a Protocol-defined Pulmonary Exacerbation","timeFrame":"Over the 18-month study period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Azithromycin","deltaMin":1.35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.758,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0043"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":45,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29890086"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":110},"commonTop":["Cough","Pyrexia","Rhinorrhoea","Nasal congestion","Vomiting"]}}
