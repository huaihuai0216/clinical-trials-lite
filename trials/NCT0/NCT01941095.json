The anticipated time on study treatment is 52 weeks. Those participants who will complete the 60-week study period and have achieved Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) remission or a good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response at 52 weeks will be eligible to enter the extension phase until tocilizumab is commercially available and reimbursed in Greece.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) Remission at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab","deltaMin":40,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["Greece"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30649524","29244149"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":31},"commonTop":["Alanine aminotransferase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Leukopenia","Nasopharyngitis","Neutropenia"]}}
