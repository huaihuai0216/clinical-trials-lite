A minimum of 25 previously treated subjects ≥ 6 to \\< 12 years of age and at least 25 subjects \\< 6 years of age who have undergone \\> 50 exposure days (EDs) with a previous Factor VIII (FVIII) product are planned to be enrolled. Subjects will be assigned to either an on-demand or prophylaxis treatment regimen and will receive rVIII-SingleChain at a dose to be determined by the investigator. Hemostatic efficacy will be assessed by the subject/caregiver and the investigator who will assess overall efficacy by a 4-point scale.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Success","timeFrame":"Up to 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Efficacy Population","deltaMin":96.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","France","Georgia","Germany","Italy","Lebanon","Malaysia","Netherlands","Philippines","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Spain","Switzerland","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":84},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Cough","Headache","Head injury"]}}
