transplant and/or radiation therapy works in treating young patients with extraocular retinoblastoma. Giving chemotherapy before an autologous stem cell transplant stops the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and/or bone marrow and stored. More chemotherapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after combination chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell transplant may kill any remaining tumor cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"At 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Stage 2/3 Patients","deltaMin":88,"sd":null},{"arm":"Stage 4a Patients","deltaMin":83,"sd":null},{"arm":"Stage 4b Patients","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":73,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","Egypt"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35820112"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":18},"commonTop":["Febrile neutropenia","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Hypokalemia","Anorexia","Mucositis oral"]}}
