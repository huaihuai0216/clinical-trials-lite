The study enrolled participants who had received an adequate trial of disease-modifying therapies but experienced at least 1 relapse during prior treatment, and who met a minimum severity of disease as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants had monthly laboratory tests and comprehensive testing every 3 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Accumulation of Disability (SAD)","timeFrame":"Up to 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Interferon Beta-1a","deltaMin":21.13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Alemtuzumab 12 mg","deltaMin":12.71,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0084"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":191,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23122650","39935588","37745914","37272540","36619856","34882037","34035833","33414927","32710396","32539719","31762387","31675266","31654272","31144568","30144037","27590291","25111080"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":44,"n":202},"commonTop":["Headache","Rash","Multiple sclerosis relapse","Nasopharyngitis","Nausea"]}}
