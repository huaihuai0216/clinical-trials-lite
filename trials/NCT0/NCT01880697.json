have posed additional risk to the subjects because of participation in the study;\n* Had the following within the past 6 months:\n\n  * had any laboratory-confirmed seasonal or pandemic influenza disease\n  * received any seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine\n* Had received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or who were planning to receive any vaccine during

any time during the conduct of this study;\n* Was part of study personnel or has close family members conducting this study;\n* Had a body mass index (BMI) \\>35 kg/m2 (BMI is calculated by dividing the subject's weight in kilograms by the subject's height in meters multiplied by the subject's height in meters);\n* Was pregnant (confirmed by positive urine pregnancy test) or nursing (breastfeeding) or was a female of childbearing potential who refused to use an acceptable method of birth control for the whole duration of the
