Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccine or planned use during the study period.\n* Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.\n* Presence of an axillary temperature \\>= 37.5°C (99.5°F), or acute symptoms greater than \"mild\" severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination.\n* Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within 6 months preceding the study start.\n* Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs within 6 months of study enrolment or planned administration during the study period.\n* Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.\n* Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with coumarin derivatives, other vitamin K antagonists or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside of 24 hours prior to vaccination are eligible. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency, are eligible.\n* Any contraindication to intramuscular administration of the influenza vaccines.\n* An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Administration of any vaccines within 30 days before vaccination.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines; a history of anaphylactic-type reaction to any constituent of influenza vaccines; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.\n* Pregnant or lactating female\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.\n* Any conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subjects from participating in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Who Were Seroprotected for Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against the Flu A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) Virus Strain","description":"A seroprotected subject was defined as a vaccinated subject with a serum HI titer greater than or equal to (≥) 1:10, that usually is accepted as indicating protection.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"74","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"64","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"69","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"63","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Titers for Serum Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against 2 Strains of Influenza Disease","description":"Titers are presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs).
