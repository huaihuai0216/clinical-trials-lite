As per protocol, the analysis for this outcome measure used pooled data from 2 studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and PSA3002) because initial power assumptions showed that 900 participants would be required to evaluate the impact of ustekinumab on structural damage (SD) progression. The 2 studies, (which had similar study designs and dosing regimens and differed only with regards to prior exposure to anti-TNFÎ± therapies), were intended to independently measure efficacy in terms of signs, symptoms and physical function, while effects on SD progression would be provided from an integrated analysis.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.97","spread":"3.852"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":"2.110"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.39","spread":"2.403"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.40","spread":"2.260"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 70 Response at Week 24","description":"An ACR 70 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 70 percent improvement from baseline in swollen (66 joints) and tender (68 joints) joint counts and greater than or equal to 70 percent improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) Participant's assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm), 2) Participant's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm), 3) Physician's global assessment of disease activity by VAS (0-10 cm) 4) Participant's assessment of physical function as measured by the \"Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire\" (HAQ-DI) (score of 0-3 in 8 functional areas) and 5) C reactive protein.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"7.7","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":104},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Psoriatic Arthropathy","Bronchitis","Sinusitis"]}}}
