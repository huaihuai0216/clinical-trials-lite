As these areas are sensitive, irritation and other adverse reactions are more common than elsewhere on the body. The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of once daily treatment for up to 8 weeks of an ointment containing calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus hydrocortisone 10 mg/g with calcipotriol 25 mcg/g in the ointment vehicle, hydrocortisone 10 mg/g in the ointment vehicle and the ointment vehicle alone in patients with psoriasis vulgaris on the face and on the intertriginous areas (= double-blind phase). Furthermore, the safety and efficacy will be evaluated for up to 60 weeks treatment as required of calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus hydrocortisone 10 mg/g ointment in psoriasis vulgaris on the face and intertriginous areas (= open-label phase).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With \"Controlled Disease\" According to the Investigator's Global Assessment(IGA) of Disease Severity of the Face at Week 8 (Visit 6) in the Double-blind Phase","timeFrame":"At Week 8 (end of treatment for double-blind phase)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LEO 80190","deltaMin":158,"sd":null},{"arm":"Calcipotriol","deltaMin":135,"sd":null},{"arm":"Hydrocortisone","deltaMin":115,"sd":null},{"arm":"LEO 80190 Vehicle","deltaMin":41,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.11"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["Croatia","Germany","Poland","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":351},"commonTop":["Psoriasis","Nasopharyngitis","Erythema","Headache","Pruritus"]}}
