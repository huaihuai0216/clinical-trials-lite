It is one of the most debilitating variants of psoriasis which very often interferes with daily activities and with the ability to work. This type of psoriasis is very difficult to treat as topicals have difficulty penetrating the thick epidermis of palms and soles and are therefore not very effective. The response to standard agents (methotrexate, cyclosporine and acitretin) is also usually limited. A number of these patients have very severe hand and feet disease with mild to no involvement elsewhere on the body.\n\nGiven the efficacy of infliximab in psoriasis, the purpose of this study is to evaluate if infliximab is safe and if it will improve severity and quality of life in patients with palmoplantar psoriasis, a debilitating variant of psoriasis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"75% Improvement in Modified Palmoplantar Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (m-PPPASI) From Day 0","timeFrame":"14 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Then Infliximab","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Infliximab","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":12},"commonTop":["Common cold","Back pain","Fatigue","Dermatitis","Headache"]}}
