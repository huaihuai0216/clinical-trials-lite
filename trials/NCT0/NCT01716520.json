This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-way crossover study. Eligible subjects will be randomized to a sequence of UMEC 62.5mcg, VI 25mcg, and UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg. All subjects will receive each treatment once-daily for 14 days, and each treatment will be separated by a 10-14 day washout period. There will be a 5-7 day run-in period prior to randomization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Obtained Post-dose at Day 14 of Each Treatment Period (TP) by Response Type","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 14 of each treatment period (up to study day 83)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC 62.5 µg","deltaMin":0.216,"sd":0.0166},{"arm":"VI 25 µg","deltaMin":0.201,"sd":0.0167},{"arm":"UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg","deltaMin":0.337,"sd":0.0166}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.047"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Estonia","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":171},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache"]}}
