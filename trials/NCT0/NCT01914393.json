The first 14 items are the same as the General Activities section of the regular Q-LES-Q form and are used to compute the raw score. The PQ-LES-Q-SF percentage maximum possible score is calculated as follows:\n\n% Max = 100 × (Raw Score - Minimum Score) / (Maximum Score - Minimum Score), where the Minimum Score equals 14 and the Maximum Score equals 70, and the % maximum possible score can range from 0% to 100%. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"59.52","spread":"15.569"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.16","spread":"16.345"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.37","spread":"16.343"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.75","spread":"16.744"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PAR) Total Score","description":"Change from Baseline in PAR Total Score for subjects continued from study D1050326 The PARS is a clinician-rated instrument for assessing over time the severity of anxiety symptoms associated with common DSM-IV anxiety disorders in children ages 6 17 years. The PARS is administered separately to the subject and to the caregiver. The instrument has 2 sections. The first section includes a 50-item symptom checklist, which the clinician rates as present or absent during the past week. The second section is comprised of 7 severity impairment items reflecting the severity/impairment of all symptoms endorsed in Section 1 of the PARS (during the past week). Each question is answered on a 0-5 Likert scale (0 for none, and 1-5 for minimal to extreme) with alternative responses of 8=Not Applicable and 9=Does Not Know. Scores of 8 or 9 are not counted in the summation as per the PARS instructions.
