The study will also investigate whether this intensive approach can help increase the presence of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), stem cells that have been shown to reduce cardiovascular (CV) events in ACS patients. This study has two phases and FDA approval for phase II has been received and all information has been updated to reflect PREMIER Phase II.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in the Total Atheroma Volume From Baseline to 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensive LDL-lowering Therapy (ILLT)","deltaMin":-7.63,"sd":23.78},{"arm":"Standard Statin Monotherapy (SMT)","deltaMin":-3.1,"sd":17.74}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2533"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"31 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37158083","32791950"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":63},"commonTop":["Chest pain","Hypotension","Procedural hypotension","Dyspnea","Epistaxis"]}}
