To evaluate differences in healthcare resource utilization and direct medical costs for patients treated with the Furoscix Infusor outside the hospital versus patients receiving intravenous furosemide for â‰¤ 72 hours in the hospital setting for 30 days post-discharge from the emergency department.\n2. To evaluate the safety of Furoscix administered outside the hospital.\n3. To evaluate and describe quality of life and patient satisfaction for patients who receive the Furoscix Infusor outside the hospital setting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Healthcare Utilization Costs","timeFrame":"Day 0 - Day 30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Furoscix Infusor Prospective Treatment","deltaMin":2920.3,"sd":7073.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":24},"commonTop":["Infusion Site Bruising","Infusion Site Pain","Dizziness","Infusion Site Hemorrhage","Muscle Spasms"]}}
