For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Any administration of a long-acting immune-modifying drug (e.g. rituximab, infliximab etc.) within 6 months before study start, or planned administration during the study period.\n* Administration of any influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the study start or planned use of such vaccines during the study period.\n* Administration of any other vaccine(s) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during the study period.\n* Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within the 6 months preceding the study vaccination.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required):\n\n  * History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,\n  * Cancer or treatment for cancer, within 3 years of study enrollment. Persons with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for 3 years or more are eligible.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.\n\n  * Acute disease is defined as the presence of a short term, moderate or severe illness, with or without fever.\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric or neurological illness. \"Uncontrolled\" is defined as:\n\n  * Requiring institution of new medical or surgical treatment within one month prior to study enrollment, or\n  * Requiring the re-institution of a previously discontinued medication or medical treatment within one month prior to study enrollment, or\n  * Requiring a change in medication dosage in the one month prior to study enrollment due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or\n  * Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a SAE within one month prior to study enrollment.\n* Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.\n* Subjects who participated in the registration trial \\[116664 (FLU Q-TIV-014)\\] for Fluviral™ 2012/2013 conducted in the 2012-2013 season.\n* Presence of blood dyscrasias, including hemoglobinopathies and myelo- or lymphoproliferative disorder.\n* A history of any demyelinating disease including Multiple Sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral™ and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to consumption of eggs, and/or reactions to products containing mercury.\n* A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study or would make the intramuscular injection unsafe.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Humoral Immune Response in Terms of Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titers Against Each of the Three Vaccine Influenza Strains","description":"Antibody titers were expressed as Geometric mean titers (GMTs).
