The 12 functional activities/questions are rated on a scale of 0 to 4 for a total scoring range of 0-48, with 48 representing optimal function.

The scale consists of 59 questions that ask about severity of the symptoms of ALS, mood and affect, intimacy, and social issues. Each question for the ALSQOL is scored from 0-10. With 59 questions, total score ranges from 0-590 with scores simply added, with 590 representing highest quality of life. However since 10 is maximally weighted towards negative values on some questions and positive values on others, the following questions must have results transposed (Simply reverse the scale, for instance 10=0 and 0=10) prior to analysis: 1-10, 11, 16, 19, 24, 26, 28, 32, 35, 36, 38, and 41.
