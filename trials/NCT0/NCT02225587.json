The primary hypotheses in the study are that 1) geometric mean titers (GMTs) to pneumococcal serotypes 22F and 33F (serotypes in Pneumovax™ 23 but not in Prevnar 13™) as measured at Week 12 are superior in participants administered Prevnar 13™ on Day 1 and Pneumovax™ 23 at Week 8, as compared with participants administered Prevnar 13™ on Day 1 and placebo at Week 8 and 2) GMTs to pneumococcal serotypes shared by the two vaccines as measured at Week 12 are non-inferior in participants administered Prevnar 13™ followed by Pneumovax™ 23 as compared with participants administered Prevnar 13™ followed by placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE)","timeFrame":"Up to 14 days after any vaccination (Up to 28 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1: Prevnar 13™ → Pneumovax™ 23 → Placebo","deltaMin":89.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group 2: Prevnar 13™ → Placebo → Pneumovax™ 23","deltaMin":84.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["34019468"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":200},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Myalgia","Fatigue","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema"]}}
