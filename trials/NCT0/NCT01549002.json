The total OSBD-R score is a summation of the OSBD-R score of each individual phase. The score in each phase can range from 0 to 23.5. There were four phases in our study, so the range of scores for the total OSBD-R was 0 to 94, with a higher score indicating a greater degree of pain and distress. The four phases in the study are (1) before analgesia administration, (2) ten minutes after analgesia administration but before beginning I\\&D, (3) immediately post I\\&D procedure (to ascertain the pain perceived during procedure), and (4) ten minutes after procedure completion. The scores documented here are the total OSBD-R scores.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.48","spread":"4.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.92","spread":"14.82"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Score on the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R)","description":"The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) is a self-report measure of pain has strong validity and reliability in children 4 - 17 years of age undergoing painful procedures, and will be used to assess patients' self reported pain.

Therefore, a lower score indicates that a patient is experiencing a lower degree of pain intensity.\n\nPatients will complete the FPS-R at four times during their medical encounter: (1) before analgesia administration, (2) ten minutes after analgesia administration but before beginning I\\&D, (3) immediately post I\\&D procedure (to ascertain the pain perceived during procedure), and (4) ten minutes after procedure completion.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Patients Satisfied With Analgesia Administered","description":"Number of patients satisfied with analgesia administered will be evaluated by determining the number of patients who report a Likert scale response of \"somewhat satisfied\", \"very satisfied\", or \"extremely satisfied\" (i.e. any patient who selects any of these three responses will be considered to have been satisfied with analgesia administered).
