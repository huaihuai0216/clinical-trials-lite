The average WPAI impairment in daily activity score from baseline to Week 72 was calculated for each participant and then the average of those values were calculated to show the average WPAI impairment in daily activity score for each treatment group. The null hypothesis was there is no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in the AUC for the change from baseline to Week 72 (AUC72) in WPAI impairment in daily activity scores. The Table below shows the WPAI Impairment in daily activity scores at Week 72 (as well as at Week 60) and the statistical analysis between treatment groups.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1580.635","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1863.071","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1727.079","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2056.283","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Area Under the Curve From Baseline to Week 60 (AUC60) and Week 72 (AUC72) for Time Missed From Work Due to Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and Its Treatment","description":"Hours missed from work because of HCV infection or its treatment was assessed by measuring the change from baseline in the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Hepatitis C questionnaire Absenteeism score (time missed from work). The possible WPAI WPAI absenteeism score range from baseline to Week 60 was 0-6000 and to Week 72 was 0-7200, with the higher scores indicating more impairment in WPAI absenteeism. The average WPAI absenteeism score from baseline to Week 60/72 was calculated for each participant and then the average of those values calculated for each treatment group. The area under the curve (AUC60/AUC72) over time from baseline to Week 60/72 was derived from a piecewise-linear model allowing the slopes to change at Week 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60.
