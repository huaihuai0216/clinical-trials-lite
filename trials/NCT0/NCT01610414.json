For this study population, non-childbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.\n\nOR Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination with the study vaccine/placebo, and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 12 months after completion of the vaccination series (i.e., until Month 13).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use during the study period. However, the investigational use of a registered or non-registered product to treat the subject's underlying disease for which the HCT was undertaken, or a complication of the underlying disease, is allowed.\n* Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n* Planned administration during the study of a HZ vaccine other than the study vaccine.\n* Occurrence of a varicella or HZ episode by clinical history within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine or study material and equipment.\n* Prophylactic antiviral therapy with activity against Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) expected to last more than 6 months after transplantation.\n* Administration and/or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between HCT and 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo. However, licensed non-replicating vaccines may be administered up to 8 days prior to dose 1and/or 2, and/or at least 14 days after any dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n* HIV infection by clinical history.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 13 (i.e., one year after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Confirmed Herpes Zoster (HZ) Episode","description":"A suspected case of HZ was defined as (1) a new rash characteristic of HZ (e.g., unilateral, dermatomal and accompanied by pain broadly defined to include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations), or a vesicular rash suggestive of VZV infection regardless of the distribution, and no alternative diagnosis; or (2) a clinical presentation (symptoms and/or signs) and specific laboratory findings\\* suggestive of VZV infection in the absence of characteristic HZ or VZV rash.\n\nA suspected case of HZ was confirmed either: by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or by the HZ Ascertainment Committee (HZAC), consisting of physicians with HZ expertise.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"49","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"135","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Duration of 'Worst' HZ-associated Pain","description":"Duration of HZ-associated pain rated as 3 or greater on the 'worst pain' Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) question, following the onset of a confirmed HZ rash over the entire pain reporting period in subjects with confirmed HZ; presented as T (day) \\[=the sum of follow-up period (for subjects without severe worst pain T is 1, for subjects with severe worst pain T is the duration of severe worst pain) expressed in days\\].","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"892.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6275.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Confirmed HZ-associated Complications","description":"This analysis excluded complications that were linked to a confirmed HZ case that occurred after the start of the relapse treatment.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN)","description":"This analysis excluded PHN episodes that were linked to a confirmed HZ case that occurred after the start of the relapse treatment.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Antigen-glycoprotein E (gE) Antibody Concentrations in a Sub-cohort of Subjects","description":"Anti-gE antibody concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL).
