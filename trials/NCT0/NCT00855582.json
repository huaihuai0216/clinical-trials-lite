However, if the investigator judges that a subject's lack of response to as-needed PDE5 inhibitors is the result of inadequate coordination between dosing and sexual activity with a treatment, the subject may be enrolled.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 12 Endpoint (5 mg)","description":"The total IPSS is obtained by combining the scores of the responses to component questions 1 through 7.
