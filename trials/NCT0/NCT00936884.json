This endpoint measures the percentage of patients who had an RFBM within 4 hours after the first dose of test article during the double-blind period; data are expressed as percentages of patients for the MNTX and placebo groups. To qualify as rescue free, the bowel movement could not occur within 6 hours after a rectal intervention (ie, rectal suppository, enema, manual disimpaction).

Therefore, no efficacy results are presented for the open-label period.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"79.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Injections Resulting in RFBM Within 4 Hours After Test Article Administration.","description":"This endpoint measures the percentage of injections resulting in RFBMs within 4 hours after test article administration during the double-blind period.
