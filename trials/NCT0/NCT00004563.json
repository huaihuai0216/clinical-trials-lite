A history of smoking within the preceding six months, other clinically significant pulmonary abnormalities,\n3. Clinically significant pulmonary hypertension requiring drug therapy.\n4. Patients taking prednisone at a dose of more than 10 mg per day, those who had previously been treated for more than four weeks with oral cyclophosphamide or had received two or more intravenous doses,\n5.
