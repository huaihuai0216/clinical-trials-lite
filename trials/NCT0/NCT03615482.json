It also evaluated whether V114 can be administered concomitantly with influenza vaccine without impairing the antibody response to the 15 serotypes contained in V114 and to the 4 influenza viruses contained in the seasonal inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV). The primary hypotheses state that immune responses to V114 and to QIV are non-inferior when administered concomitantly as compared with non-concomitant administration as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 30 days postvaccination. This study will also contribute to the overall safety database and immunogenicity data for V114 to support initial licensure in adults.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event","timeFrame":"Up to Day 5 after vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Concomitant Group","deltaMin":10.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Non-Concomitant Group","deltaMin":11.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.617"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.320"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.310"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":45,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34726574"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":600},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Fatigue","Headache","Myalgia","Injection site swelling"]}}
