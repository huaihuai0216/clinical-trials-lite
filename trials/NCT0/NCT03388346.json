If this works, prostate cancer treatments can be prescribed that match the location of the disease. PSMA is radiolabeled with Gallium-68 (Ga-68). This means a participant receives a small dose of radiation from the drug - less than the annual radiation limit for a medical worker.\n\nTo test this new drug, participants will receive an injection of Ga-68 PSMA and then have a PET scan. This PET scan, and the reported results, will be entered into the medical record and shared with the treating oncologists.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sensitivity of Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) for the Detection of Regional Pelvic Nodal Metastases on a Per Patient Basis","timeFrame":"within 2 weeks of prostatectomy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"68Ga PSMA PET Scan","deltaMin":0.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26682756","27207581","25791990","25411132","28012435"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Surgical and medical procedures - Other, specify"]}}
