PASI score is calculated by evaluating the severity of symptoms in each regions of the subject, and produces a numeric score ranging from 0 to 72.\n\nThe higher the number, the more severe the symptoms. In general, a PASI score of 5 to 10 is considered moderate disease, and a score over 10 is considered severe.\n\nThe primary endpoint of this clinical trial is % change in PASI, which has a value between 0 and 100, with 100 indicating complete disappearance of symptoms and 0 indicating no improvement in symptoms.\n\nIf the patient's Baseline PASI score was 10, and 5 at the measurement period, it means that the patient showed 50% reduction.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"77.5","spread":"2.595"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"77.85","spread":"2.587"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"87.59","spread":"1.886"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"87.89","spread":"1.884"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":299},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","COVID-19","Hypertension","Headache","Rhinitis"]}}}
