Participants will be eligible for enrollment in the study at, or within 28 days after, the Week 24 visit of Studies GA39688/GA39855. After enrollment into this open-label extension (OLE) study, participants will receive 28 weeks of dosing of omalizumab before entering a 24-week off-treatment observation phase of the study. Baseline in this OLE study is defined as the last pre-treatment measurement prior to randomization in Studies GA39688/GA39855 (i.e., baseline of Studies GA39688/GA39855). The data that will be reported from baseline to Week 24 inclusive will come from Studies GA39688/GA39855.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Nasal Polyp Score (NPS)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Received Placebo in GA39688 or GA39855","deltaMin":-0.17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Received Omalizumab in GA39688 or GA39855","deltaMin":-0.85,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":79,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Hungary","Mexico","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Spain","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37951571"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":125},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Sinusitis","Nasal polyps"]}}
