The full range of the HAQ scale is 0-24 with 0 being the best possible outcome. The HAQ score is calculated as the sum of the category scores divided by the number of categories scored, giving a possible range of scores from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best possible outcome (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, or 3=unable to do). The mean change from baseline at Week 24 in HAQ score is provided below for each treatment group. A negative change from baseline is indicative of a lesser degree of difficulty in accomplishing tasks assessed in the HAQ.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1525","spread":"0.69164"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.2623","spread":"0.56767"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":128},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Liver Function Test Abnormal","Anaemia"]}}}
