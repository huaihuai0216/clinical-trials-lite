Although the study started with only 1 population, amendments to the original protocol will now reflect three participant populations. Three age cohorts will be enrolled. The first cohort (age 60-64) will be blinded. Cohort 2 (age 50-59) and cohort 3 (age 18-49) are open label. Subjects in cohorts 1 and 2 will receive 2 vaccinations 3-4 years apart. Subjects in cohort 3 will receive 1 vaccination. All participants should be naïve of 23vPS. Comparisons of immune responses from the different cohorts will be done.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Serotype-specific Opsonophagocytic Activity (OPA) Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) 1 Month After Vaccination 1","timeFrame":"One month after vaccination 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC, Cohort 1","deltaMin":146,"sd":null},{"arm":"23vPS, Cohort 1","deltaMin":104,"sd":null},{"arm":"13vPnC, Cohort 2","deltaMin":200,"sd":null},{"arm":"13vPnC, Cohort 3","deltaMin":353,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=6115A1-004&StudyName=Study%20Comparing%20a%2013-valent%20Pneumococcal%20Conjugate%20Vaccine%20With%2023-valent%20Pneumococcal%20Polysaccharide%20Vaccine%20in%20Adults"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":417},"commonTop":["Pain (Any)","Pain (Mild)","Fatigue","New generalized muscle pain","Headache"]}}
