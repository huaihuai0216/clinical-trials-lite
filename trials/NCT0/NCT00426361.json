Vaccination of pre-teens and adolescents, ideally before sexual debut and thus before exposure to oncogenic HPV, is a rational strategy for prevention of cervical cancer, and so HPV vaccination could complement the existing pre-adolescent/adolescents platform. Therefore, this Phase IIIb study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of co-administering Boostrix polio (dTpa-IPV) with GSK Biologicals' (580299)HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine (Cervarix TM) as compared to the administration of either vaccine alone.\n\nThe Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Seroprotected Against Diphtheria and Tetanus","timeFrame":"One month after vaccination with Boostrix Polio","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix + Boostrix Polio Group","deltaMin":238,"sd":null},{"arm":"Boostrix Polio → Cervarix Group","deltaMin":233,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["France","Germany","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20113920"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":248},"commonTop":["Pain","Redness","Myalgia","Swelling","Headache"]}}
