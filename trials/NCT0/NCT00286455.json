Subjects will qualify if both of the following conditions apply:\n\n  * Subject has failed treatment with diet and exercise for at least one month prior to Screening\n  * Subject has received less than 7 days of any antidiabetic therapy within the 3 months prior to Screening Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes must be based on current American Diabetes Association criteria.\n* Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2\n* Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL (greater than or equal to 0.26 nmol per L). (If this screening criterion is not met, the subject still qualifies if C-peptide greater than or equal to1.5 ng per mL (greater than or equal to 0.50 nmol per L) after a challenge test.\n* Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive\n* If regular use of other, non-excluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at least the 4 weeks prior to Screening. However, as needed use of prescription or over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure less than or equal to 110 mm Hg\n* Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g per dL (greater than or equal to 120 gm per L) for males and greater than or equal to 10 g per dL (greater than or equal to 100 gm per L) for females\n* Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal\n* Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg per dL (less than or equal to 17 micromol per L)\n* Thyroid-stimulating hormone level less than or equal to the upper limit of the normal range and the subject is clinically euthyroid\n* Neither pregnant (confirmed by laboratory testing in females of childbearing potential) nor lactating.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must be practicing adequate contraception.

(Exception: if a subject has received other antidiabetic therapy for less than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)\n  * Treatment with weight-loss drugs, any investigational antidiabetics, or oral or systemically injected glucocorticoids is not allowed from 3 months prior to randomization through the completion of the end-of-treatment/early termination procedures. Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n  * Subjects are not to take any medications, including over-the-counter products, without first consulting with the Study Doctor.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80
