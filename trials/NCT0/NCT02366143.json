The SILC questionnaire comprises three individual symptoms (dyspnea, cough, chest pain) and are scored at the individual symptom level, thus have a dyspnea score, chest pain score, and cough score. Each individual symptom score is calculated as the average of responses for the symptom items \\[e.g. Chest Pain Score=mean (item 1; item 2)\\].
