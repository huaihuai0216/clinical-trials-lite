Therapeutic goals for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 include hastening recovery and preventing progression to critical illness, multiorgan failure, or death. Our objective is to determine whether modulating the host tissue response improves clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19. The primary analysis will include data from NCT05593770.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Oxygen Free Days Through Day 28.","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TXA127 (4/20/2022 Arm Closed to Accrual)","deltaMin":9,"sd":10.9},{"arm":"TXA127 Placebo","deltaMin":11.3,"sd":11.5},{"arm":"TRV027 (4/20/2022 Arm Closed to Accrual)","deltaMin":8.1,"sd":10.8},{"arm":"TRV027 Placebo","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":11.5},{"arm":"Fostamatinib","deltaMin":13.4,"sd":12.4},{"arm":"Fostamatinib Placebo","deltaMin":14.2,"sd":12.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":51,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39625722","37039791"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":176},"commonTop":["Hypertransaminasaemia","Hyperglycaemia","Headache","Diarrhoea","Nausea"]}}
