Patients will be stratified as \\<6 months or 6+ months taxane interval/no prior taxane.\n* Patients will generally have received at least 2 lines of prior chemotherapy, but may enter if they have relapsed within 6 months of first line therapy. Patients may have received prior liposomal doxorubicin, although this is NOT a requirement. The treatment immediately prior to study entry need not be platinum-based.\n* Measurable or evaluable disease (if not measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, patients must be evaluable by Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) CA125 criteria).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-2\n* Adequate haematological and biochemical function.\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* Prior administration of weekly paclitaxel.\n* Tumours of malignant mixed mesodermal (MMMT) or mucinous subtypes, or non-epithelial ovarian cancers (e.g. Brenner tumours, Sex-cord tumours).\n* Unresolved bowel obstruction.\n* Chemotherapy within the preceding 3 weeks.\n* Radiotherapy within the preceding 3 weeks.\n* Treatment with any investigational agent within the preceding 4 weeks or within 5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.\n* Known leptomeningeal involvement or intracranial disease.\n* Evidence of interstitial lung disease (bilateral, diffuse, parenchymal lung disease).\n* Resting ECG with measurable QTc interval of \\>480 msec at 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period.\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Fertile women of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective contraception for the duration of trial treatment and for at least 6 months after the last administration of saracatinib +/- paclitaxel.\n* Inability or unwillingness to give informed consent.\n* Ongoing active infection or a documented history of HIV infection, Hepatitis B or C.\n* Concurrent congestive heart failure or prior history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV cardiac disease.\n* Concurrent autoimmune disorder, e.g. systemic lupus or any demyelinating disease.\n* Use of immunosuppressive therapy or corticosteroids taken within the 4 weeks prior to study entry and during the treatment period.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"6 Month Progression-free Survival Rate (PFS) (Based on Combined Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 +/- Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA125 Criteria)","description":"Where a patient's disease is not measurable by RECIST v1.1, response may be based on GCIG CA125 criteria plus symptoms.\n\nThe 6 month progression-free survival rate will be calculated by the trial statistician during the final analysis.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"90% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival","description":null,"paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Objective Response Rate Based on Investigator Assessment Based on RECIST v1.1 +/- GCIG CA125 Criteria","description":"Where a patient's disease is not measurable by RECIST v1.1, response may be based on GCIG CA125 criteria plus symptoms.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"43","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Median Duration of Response","description":"Where a patient's disease is not measurable by RECIST v1.1, response may be based on GCIG CA125 criteria plus symptoms.\n\nDuration of Response will be calculated by the trial statistician during the final analysis.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Quality of Life: Trial Outcome Index (TOI) Based on FACT-O","description":"The TOI value for each patient is derived at each timepoint by calculating the sum of 3 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB), Functional Well-Being (FWB), Additional Concerns.
