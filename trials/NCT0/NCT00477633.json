To obtain \"mean median duration\" of episodes during a cycle, take the median duration of all episodes in each cycle. If there are no episodes in the cycle, then median duration is undefined/missing for that cycle. 1 episode - median duration = duration of that episode, 2 episodes - median duration = average of 2 durations, more than 2 episodes, calculated in usual way for median of an ordered set of numbers. Once median determined for each cycle/subject, the mean \\& SD of those quantities calculated.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.52","spread":"2.14"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":1677},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Nasopharyngitis","Nausea","Sinusitis","Headache"]}}}
