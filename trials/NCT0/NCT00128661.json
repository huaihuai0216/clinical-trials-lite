Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response against human papillomavirus and may be effective in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer. It is not yet known whether human papillomavirus vaccine is more effective than hepatitis A vaccine in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying human papillomavirus vaccine to see how well it works compared to hepatitis A vaccine in preventing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer in younger healthy participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Histopathologically Confirmed Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)2+ Cases Associated With HPV16 and/or HPV18 Infection Detected in the Preceding Cervical Cytology Specimen.","timeFrame":"From Month 6 up to Month 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix Group","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Havrix Group","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Costa Rica"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21908768","21241731","40796225","39961279","37040086","35842229","35709811","35017496","32214382","29718393","26892991","26467666","26346155","26071347","25796338","25139208","25018097","24958910","24014882","23873171","23834901","22850119","21865087","20197322","18948732","17699008"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":912,"n":3727},"commonTop":["Pain","Menstruation irregular","Influenza","Vaginal infection","Headache"]}}
