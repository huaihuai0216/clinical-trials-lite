Several properties of oteseconazole (VT-1161) suggest it might be a safer and more effective treatment of RVVC than other oral antifungal medications.\n\nThis study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oteseconazole (VT-1161) for the treatment of acute VVC episodes in patients with RVVC and consists of 2 parts. The first part of the study is a 2-week induction phase for the treatment of the patient's current VVC episode when the patient will take either fluconazole or oteseconazole (VT-1161) according to a random assignment. The second part consists of an 11-week maintenance phase, when the patient will take either oteseconazole (VT-1161) or a placebo according to the random assignment from the first part of the study, and then a 37-week follow-up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With 1 or More Culture-verified Acute VVC Episodes During the Maintenance Phase of the Study in the Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population","timeFrame":"48 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oteseconazole (VT-1161)","deltaMin":5.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fluconazole / Placebo","deltaMin":42.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36396498"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":146},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Bacterial vaginosis","Headache","Pyrexia","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
