Although these regimens are not intended to be bioequivalent, they are both expected to achieve therapeutic plasma levels and induce effective diuresis.\n\nThe test formulation in this study is a buffered solution, Furosemide Injection Solution at 8 mg/mL at pH 7.4 (range 7.0 to 7.8) and is intended for SC injection according to the instructions in the protocol. A commercial formulation of Furosemide Injection, USP will serve as the reference drug in this study, which will be administered by IV bolus. It contains furosemide 10 mg/mL in solution at alkaline pH of 8.0 to 9.3 and is marketed for IV and IM injection.\n\nThe objectives of this study are:\n\n* To characterize the pharmacokinetics of furosemide administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion using a biphasic delivery profile.\n* To estimate the absolute bioavailability of furosemide administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion compared with an equivalent dose of furosemide administered by intravenous bolus administration.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cmax","timeFrame":"0, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, 2:05 min, 2:15 min, 2:30 min, 2:45 min, 3 hours, 3:30 min, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 hours post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IV Furosemide","deltaMin":8580,"sd":2540},{"arm":"SC Furosemide","deltaMin":2040,"sd":449}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":16},"commonTop":["Application site erythema","Application site edema","Nodule","BNP elevated","Peripheral pulse decreased"]}}
