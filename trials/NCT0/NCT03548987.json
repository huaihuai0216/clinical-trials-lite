This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new medicine) and people taking \"dummy\" medicine. In addition to taking the medicine, the participant will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more physically active and what a participant can do to lose weight.\n\nThe participant will get semaglutide for the first 20 weeks. Then the participant will get either semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment the participant gets after the 20 weeks is decided by chance. The participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study will last for about 1.5 years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Randomisation to Week 68 in Body Weight (%)","timeFrame":"Randomisation (week 20) to week 68","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-8.3,"sd":8.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.5,"sd":7.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","Denmark","Israel","Netherlands","Portugal","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32441473","33755728","37605636","36200477","35724304","30122305"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":902},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Vomiting","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
