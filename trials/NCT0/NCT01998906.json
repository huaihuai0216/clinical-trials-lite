In non-inflammatory cancer, PD was concluded if either the investigator judged the participant as having progressed at any time prior to surgery, or there was at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesions (TLs), any new lesion, or clear progression of any nontarget lesion (NTLs). Clear progression of any NTL was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of NTLs compared to BL. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease from BL in the sum of the longest diameter of TLs.
