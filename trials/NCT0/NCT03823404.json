Computed Tomography scan can be used only if the subject has an absolute contraindication for MRI.\n* Subject has a Modified Hachinski score ≤4 at screening.\n* Subjects with background symptomatic therapy with acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, and/or memantine, are allowed as long as the dose has been stable for 90 days prior to screening and no changes are planned during the study.\n* Subject has a primary caregiver willing to accept responsibility for supervising the treatment (e.g., administering study drug) and assessing the condition of the subject throughout the study in accordance with all protocol requirements.\n* Subject has body mass index \\<38 kg/m2 at Screening\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject has imaging consistent with a dementia diagnosis other than AD.\n* Subject has had an increase or restoration of cognition based on medical history.\n* Subject with history or current evidence of major psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder that may interfere with the patient's ability to perform the study and all assessments. Note: Mild depression or depressive mood arising in the context of AD are not criteria for exclusion. The use of anti-depressants or the use of anti epileptic medication for non seizure-related treatment is allowed if the dose has remained stable for at least 60 days prior to enrollment.\n* Subject has any of the following laboratory findings at screening:\n\n  1. Alanine aminotransferase \\>3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase \\>3 x ULN, or history of clinically significant liver disease in the Investigator's judgment.\n  2. Hemoglobin ≤10 g/dl.\n  3. Creatinine clearance (CL) of \\<45 ml/min.\n  4. Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) \\>8.\n  5. Positive blood screen for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV 1 and 2), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCV-Ab) at Screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","genderBased":true,"genderDescription":"Male and female.","minimumAge":"55 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog 11)","description":"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog 11) - Total Score The cognitive subscale of the ADAS (ADAS Cog11) was used as a primary efficacy measure and consists of 11 items assessing areas of function most typically impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD): orientation, verbal memory, language, and praxis. he scale ranges from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.7","spread":"8.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23.4","spread":"8.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"23.6","spread":"9.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26.6","spread":"12.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.9","spread":"11.8"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"28.4","spread":"12.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL)","description":"The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Inventory Score is a 23-item inventory.\n\nThe ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities of daily living The total ADCS-ADL score ranges from 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"59.9","spread":"11.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"60.1","spread":"11.3"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"60.4","spread":"11.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"55.4","spread":"13.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"54.4","spread":"13.7"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"55.5","spread":"14.1"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB)","description":"Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - Sum of Boxes CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers.
