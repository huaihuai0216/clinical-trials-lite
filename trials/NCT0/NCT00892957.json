(A definition of eligible suture line bleeding is provided in the study protocol.)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPreoperative exclusion criteria:\n\n* Other vascular procedures during the same surgical session (stenting and/or endarterectomy of the same artery are allowed)\n* Congenital coagulation disorders\n* Prior kidney transplantation\n* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\n* Known hypersensitivity to heparin\n* Known hypersensitivity to aprotinin or other components of the product\n* Known severe congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (eg, HIV infection or long-term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (eg, organ transplantation patients)\n* Prior radiation therapy to the operating field\n* Severe local inflammation at the operating field\n* Subject is pregnant or lactating at the time of enrollment\n* Subject has participated in another clinical study involving an investigational product (IP) or investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during the course of this study\n* Subject has previously participated in this study (Protocol No.: 550801), ie, each subject can only be enrolled once.\n\nIntraoperative Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the planned surgical procedure\n* Intraoperative change in planned surgical procedure, which results in subject no longer meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criteria, (eg, abandonment of ePTFE graft placement)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of
