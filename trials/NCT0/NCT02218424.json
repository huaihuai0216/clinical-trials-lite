Those in Arm 1 will receive magnesium (30 mg/kg bolus followed by a 10mg/kg/hr infusion) while those in Arm 2 will receive an equal volume of normal saline bolus followed by infusion (placebo).\n\nThe primary objective is to determine if systemic magnesium will decrease postoperative pain in patients undergoing tonsillectomy. The secondary objectives will determine if systemic magnesium administration is associated with a decrease in opioid-related side effects, decrease the incidence of emergence delirium, and improve postoperative functional recovery.\n\nThe study hypothesis is that the use of intravenous magnesium will decrease postoperative pain, decrease opioid-related side effects, decrease the incidence of emergence delirium, and improve functional recovery in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postoperative Pain","timeFrame":"90 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Magnesium","deltaMin":30,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Infusion","deltaMin":45,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":[]}}
