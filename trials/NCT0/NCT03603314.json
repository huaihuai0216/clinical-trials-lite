with unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss or unilateral/bilateral acute acoustic trauma leading to sudden sensorineural hearing loss.\n* Patients with sudden hearing loss with onset within 96 hours prior to prior to first study drug intake.\n* Patients under highly effective contraception\n\nThe main criteria for exclusion:\n\n* Bilateral idiopathic hearing loss\n* Fluctuating hearing loss\n* History of asymmetric hearing (\\>20 dB difference between ears) to the best knowledge of the patient\n* Severe hearing loss (\\>90 dB) associated with unilateral (ipsilateral) complete vestibular loss.\n* History of Ménière's disease, autoimmune hearing loss, radiation-induced hearing loss, acoustic neuroma (schwannoma), otosclerosis, suspected perilymph fistula or membrane rupture, suspected retro-cochlear lesion, or barotrauma\n* Previous SSNHL in the affected ear within the past 6 weeks\n* Complete loss of peripheral vestibular function on the affected side\n* Any drug-based therapy for inner ear hearing loss that is ongoing or was performed in the past 6 weeks (except oral corticosteroids)\n* Any ongoing or planned concomitant medication for the treatment of tinnitus until 6 weeks after administration.\n* Any therapy known as ototoxic (e.g. aminoglycosides, cisplatin, loop diuretics, quinine etc.) at the current time or in the past 6 months or planned in the coming 3 months.\n* Acute or chronic otitis media or otitis externa terminated less than 7 days\n* Prior ear surgery of any kind (except ventilating tubes), or cochlear implants\n* Known history of, or concomitant severe hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological (except vertigo or tinnitus), hematological, renal, dermatological or psychiatric disease or substance abuse\n* Neurological disorders including stroke, demyelinating disease, brain stem or cerebellar dysfunction within the last 3 months.\n* Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks or any past treatment with azasetron or with 5-HT3 antagonists, or any prior or planned treatment by antidepressant treatment containing serotoninergic agents.\n* Patients with either a history of significant arrhythmia, or a history of conditions known to increase the proarrhythmic risk (e.g., congestive heart failure, long QT Syndrome, hypokalemia etc...).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
