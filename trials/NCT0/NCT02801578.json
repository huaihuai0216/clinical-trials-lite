However, some researchers think the approved dose may be unnecessarily high.\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to compare 3 different daily doses of ibrutinib to learn how these doses affect the disease and your body. Researchers think that if a lower dose of ibrutinib can be found to be as effective as the currently approved dose this may help to lower the risk of side effects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With >/= 95 % Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Occupancy","timeFrame":"3 cycles, up to 90 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ibrutinib","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30254130"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":11},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Nausea","Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease","Bruising","Rash Acneiform"]}}
