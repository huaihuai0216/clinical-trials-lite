of cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body)\n* Participants with mean 24-hour Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score (11-point NRS used to measure the pain level for the past 24-hours where 0=no pain to 10=pain as bad as you can imagine) during 3 days (Day -4 to Day -2) before randomization (study drug assigned by chance) less than 4.0\n* Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or before entry and throughout the study practicing an effective method of birth control\n* Participants using immediate-release (IR) morphine hydrochloride (HCl) or oxycodone HCl hydrate as rescue medication (rescue medications are medicines that may be administered to the participants when the efficacy of the study drug is not satisfactory, or the effect of the study drug is too great and is likely to cause a hazard to the participant, or to manage an emergency situation) for breakthrough pain\n* Participants treated with around-the-clock opioid (morphine-like medications) therapy for moderate to severe (very serious, life threatening) chronic (lasting a long time), malignant (cancerous) tumor-related (a mass in a specific area) cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body) pain using one of the following opioid analgesics (drug used to control pain) before randomization: morphine SR tablet less than or equal to 120 milligram (mg) per day, oxycodone hydrochloride controlled release (CR) tablet: 15 mg to 80 mg per day, durotep MT (fentanyl transdermal \\[through the skin\\] matrix) patch less than or equal to 8.4 mg per patch, fentos tape less than or equal to 4 mg per tape, or oneduro patch less than or equal to 3.4 mg per patch\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with complicated uncontrolled/clinically significant arrhythmia (uneven heart beat)\n* Participants who had received rescue doses 3 times or more daily within 3 days (Day -4 to Day -2) before the randomization\n* History of surgery intended for the cure of the primary disease or for the treatment of cancer pain within 28 days before screening\n* Participants who had application of radiotherapy (treatment of cancer using x-rays), nerve block, or stimulation analgesia within 7 days before screening\n* Participants with known allergies (over sensitivity to a substance), hypersensitivity, or intolerance to opioid analgesics or its excipients","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20
