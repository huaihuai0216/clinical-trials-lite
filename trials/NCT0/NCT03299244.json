Other investigational procedures while participating in this study are excluded.\n* Subject has received etelcalcetide in a prior clinical trial of etelcalcetide.\n* Subject has received cinacalcet during the 3 months prior to the first screening laboratory assessments.\n* Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products or components of either cinacalcet or etelcalcetide to be administered during dosing.\n* Subject has previously been randomized in this study.\n* Anticipated or scheduled parathyroidectomy during the study period.\n* Subject has received a parathyroidectomy within 6 months prior to dosing.\n* Anticipated or scheduled kidney transplant during the study period.\n* Subject has an unstable medical condition based on medical history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests, or is otherwise unstable in the judgment of the Investigator.\n* Malignancy within the last 5 years of screening (except non-melanoma skin cancers or cervical carcinoma in situ).\n* Grapefruit juice is prohibited.\n* Subject is pregnant or nursing, or planning to become pregnant or nurse during treatment or within 3 months after the last dose of etelcalcetide or 30 days after the last dose of cinacalcet\n* Female subject of childbearing potential who is unwilling to use an acceptable method of effective contraception during treatment with investigational product (IP) through 3 months after the last dose of IP.\n* Subject has a history of symptomatic ventricular dysrhythmias or Torsades de Pointes.\n* Subject has a history of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, or coronary arterial bypass grafting within the past 6 months prior to screening.\n* Subject has clinically significant abnormalities on prestudy clinical examination or abnormalities on the most recent central laboratory tests during the screening period prior to randomization according to the Investigator including but not limited to the following:\n\n  * serum albumin \\< 3.0 g/dL\n  * serum magnesium \\< 1.5 mg/dL\n  * serum transaminase (alanine transaminase \\[ALT\\] or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase \\[SGPT\\], aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\]) \\> 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening.\n* Subject likely not available to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, and/or to comply with all required study procedures to the best of the subject and Investigator's knowledge.\n* History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With > 30% Reduction From Baseline in Mean Predialysis Intact Parathyroid Hormone During the Efficacy Assessment Phase -
