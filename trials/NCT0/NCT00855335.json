This study will examine how these drugs are absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body over time. Any pregnant woman who is currently receiving darunavir with ritonavir, darunavir with cobicistat, etravirine or rilpivirine for HIV-1, and who meets the eligibility criteria for the study, will be allowed to enroll. Patients must be willing to remain on study medication during the course of their pregnancy, and 12 weeks postpartum. The information collected may help answer questions about how to best prescribe these three drugs for pregnant women.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Predose (Trough) Plasma Concentration (C0h)","timeFrame":"Predose on Weeks 24-28 (Visit 4, 2nd trimester), 34-38 (visit 5, 3rd trimester) and 6-12 weeks postpartum (visit 8)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Darunavir 600 mg (Darunavir 600/Ritonavir 100 mg) Twice Daily","deltaMin":3608,"sd":2812},{"arm":"Ritonavir 100 mg (Darunavir 600/Ritonavir 100 mg) Twice Daily","deltaMin":491.4,"sd":472.4},{"arm":"Darunavir 800 mg (Darunavir 800/Ritonavir 100 mg) Once Daily","deltaMin":2481,"sd":2183},{"arm":"Ritonavir 100 mg (Darunavir 800/Ritonavir 100 mg) Once Daily","deltaMin":147,"sd":198},{"arm":"Etravirine 200 mg Twice Daily","deltaMin":281,"sd":193},{"arm":"Rilpivirine 25 mg Once Daily","deltaMin":127,"sd":97},{"arm":"Darunavir 800 mg (Darunavir 800/Cobicistat 150 mg) Once Daily","deltaMin":2811,"sd":2296},{"arm":"Cobicistat 150 mg (Darunavir 800/Cobicistat 150 mg) Once Daily","deltaMin":134,"sd":145}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29335895"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":18},"commonTop":["Nausea","Premature Labour","Anaemia","Vomiting","Vaginitis Bacterial"]}}
