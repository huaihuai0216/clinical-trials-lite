Which treatment participants get is decided by chance. IcoSema and insulin icodec are both new medicines that doctors cannot prescribe.\n\nParticipants will get IcoSema or insulin icodec, which participants must inject once a week with a pen, which has a small needle, in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm, or stomach.\n\nThe study will last for about 1 year and 1 month. Participants will have 21 clinic visits, 31 phone/video calls with the study doctor, and 4 contacts with the site that can either be clinic visits or phone/video calls At 11 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 7 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to get pregnant during the study period.\n\nNot applicable for China: Participants will be asked to wear a sensor that measures their blood sugar level all the time during a 5 week period at the end of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 0), Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IcoSema","deltaMin":-1.6,"sd":0.99},{"arm":"Insulin Icodec","deltaMin":-0.9,"sd":1.01}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":210,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","China","Croatia","Finland","India","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Serbia","South Africa","South Korea","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40482671"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":69,"n":644},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","COVID-19","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
