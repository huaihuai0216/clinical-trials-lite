Speech intelligibility tests, speaker localization tests and preference tests are performed. The results of a diotic (current rendering) and a binaural (suggested rendering) rendering are compared.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Speech Intelligibility","timeFrame":"1 day of the experiment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Normal Hearing","deltaMin":63,"sd":4},{"arm":"Moderate Hearing Impaired","deltaMin":60,"sd":6},{"arm":"Severe Hearing Impaired","deltaMin":59,"sd":6},{"arm":"Profound Hearing Impaired","deltaMin":48,"sd":12}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29457537"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
