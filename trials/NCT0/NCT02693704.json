The SRS correspond to the number of understood words in a sequence of sentences (French HINT database) mixed with several level of masking noise (speech-shaped noise). Some are played diotically, the other are spatialized in various directions. The goal is to ensure that the spatialization processing does not degrade the understanding of the speech.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"63","spread":"4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"60","spread":"6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"59","spread":"6"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"48","spread":"12"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"68","spread":"3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"67","spread":"6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"66","spread":"7"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"47","spread":"9"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Speaker's Localization","description":"Localization error (in number of spatial sectors)\n\nFor each group: average localization error over all subjects in the group.
