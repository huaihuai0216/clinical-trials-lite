Patients currently receiving maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa will be randomized to receive either monthly injections of Mircera with a starting dose (120, 200 or 360 micrograms) derived from the dose of epoetin alfa they were receiving in the week preceding study start, or to continue on epoetin alfa treatment. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Their Mean Hemoglobin Concentration Within Plus or Minus 1 Gram/Deciliter of Their Reference Hemoglobin and Between the Target Range During Efficacy Evaluation Period","timeFrame":"EEP (Week 29 to Week 36)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"C.E.R.A.","deltaMin":50.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Epoetin Alpha","deltaMin":53,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["Brazil"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":112},"commonTop":["Muscle Spasms","Hypotension","Headache","Hypertension","Back Pain"]}}
