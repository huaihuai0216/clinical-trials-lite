The 9 varicose vein symptoms assessed using the e-diary were derived from the first question of the modified Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study-Quality of Life/Symptoms (VEINES-QOL/Sym) instrument. The VVSymQ is a subset of 5 VEINES QOL/Sym items that have been determined in earlier studies to be most important to patients. The daily VVSymQ score is the sum of the duration scores for these 5 symptoms (scores range from 0 to 25). At Visit 2/baseline, Week 8, scores were calculated.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.00","spread":"0.474"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.34","spread":"0.476"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-6.01","spread":"0.454"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-5.06","spread":"0.463"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to 8 Weeks in Appearance as Rated by Patient (PA-V3)","description":"The Patient Self-assessment of Visible Varicose Veins (PA-V3) instrument is a 5-point scale used by patients to evaluate the appearance of their visible varicose veins.
