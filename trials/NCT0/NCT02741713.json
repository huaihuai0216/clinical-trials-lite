The interscalene block is effective in providing analgesia to the majority of the shoulder joint and has been shown to reduce post-operative pain scores after arthroscopic shoulder surgeries. However, there is a subset of arthroscopic shoulder surgery patients who have pain in the axilla even in the setting of a functioning interscalene brachial plexus nerve block. One of our surgeons has reported a high incidence of axillary pain in patients who undergo a sub-pectoral biceps tenodesis as part of their arthroscopic procedure. A newly described nerve block approach to the nerves that supply sensation to the axillary region called the PECS \"Pectoralis\" 1 \\& 2 block may provide additional analgesia to these patients.\n\nThe purpose of this prospective, randomized, observer and patient blinded, single-center, sham block trial is to determine if the addition of PECS blocks to an interscalene block will reduce the severity of axillary pain following arthroscopic shoulder surgery that involves a sub-pectoral biceps tenodesis. Secondarily, the study will assess the duration of PECS 1 \\& 2 and whether the block reduces post-operative opioid usage. We hypothesize that the addition of the PECS 1 \\& 2 block will reduce the severity of axillary pain at 6hrs and reduce postoperative narcotic usage for the first 24 hours.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Post-operative Axillary Pain","timeFrame":"6 hours post-block.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Interscalene Block Plus Sham Block","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Interscalene Plus PECS Blocks","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31136331"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":[]}}
