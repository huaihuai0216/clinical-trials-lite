The investigators aim to examine the use of IV and oral ketorolac as an adjunctive agent to the standard of care pain protocol for postoperative pain control following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.\n2. The investigators hypothesize that the use of IV and oral ketorolac in addition to the standard of care pain protocol will reduce postoperative opioid consumption following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postoperative Visual Analog Scale Scores","timeFrame":"participants were assessed at one single time point up to 8 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":30,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ketorolac","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":["Drowsiness","Nausea/Vomiting","Constipation","Dizziness","Insomnia"]}}
