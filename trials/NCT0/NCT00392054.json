The EQ-5D Index score is a descriptive system comprising five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Self-reported severity for each dimension is given on a 3 level scale: (1) no problems, (2) some problems or (3) major problems. For example a health state: 11223 means: no problems with mobility (1), no problems with self-care (1), some problems with performing usual activity (2), moderate pain/discomfort (2), and major anxiety/depression (3). Thus there are 243 patterns of health state: 11111 to 33333. Scores are converted to a single weighted index score (utility). The index score is derived by applying a formula as developed by Shaw JW, Johnson JA, Coons SJ. US valuation of the EQ-5D health states: development and testing of the D1 valuation model. Med Care 2005; 43(3): 203-220.
