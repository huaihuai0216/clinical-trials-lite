discontinued study ZS-004 during the DBRMP due to hypo- or hyperkalemia and able to start dosing in ZS-004E within two (2) days after the last dose of Investigational product in ZS-004.\n* Subject must have an i-STAT potassium value that is 3.5 to 6.2 mmol/l inclusive at the ZS-004 DBRMP Study Day 29 visit or a mean i-STAT potassium value from two consecutive measurements at 0 and 60 minutes on Acute Phase Day 1/Maintenance Phase Day 1 that is 3.5 to 6.2 mmol/l inclusive if the subject discontinued study ZS-004 during the DBRMP due to hypo- or hyperkalemia .\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pseudohyperkalemia signs and symptoms, such as excessive fist clenching hemolyzed blood specimen, history of severe leukocytosis or thrombocytosis.\n* Subjects who received alternative treatment for hyperkalemia while participating in study ZS-004.\n* Subjects with a life expectancy of less than 3 months.\n* Subjects who are severely physically or mentally incapacitated and who in the opinion of investigator are unable to perform the subjects' tasks associated with the protocol.\n* Women who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant.\n* Subjects with diabetic ketoacidosis.\n* Presence of any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the subject at undue risk or potentially jeopardizes the quality of the data to be generated.\n* Known hypersensitivity or previous anaphylaxis to ZS or to components thereof.\n* Treatment with a drug or device other than ZS within the last 30 days that has not received regulatory approval at the time of study entry.\n* Subjects with cardiac arrhythmias that require immediate treatment.\n* Subjects on dialysis.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
