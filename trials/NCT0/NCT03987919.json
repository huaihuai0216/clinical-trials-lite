The scores from the 6 treatment satisfaction items are summed to a Total Treatment Satisfaction Score, which ranges from -18 to 18 where the higher the score the greater the improvement in satisfaction with treatment. The lower the score the greater the deterioration in satisfaction with treatment. The hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia scores range from -3 to 3 where negative scores indicate fewer problems with blood glucose levels and positive scores indicate more problems than before.
