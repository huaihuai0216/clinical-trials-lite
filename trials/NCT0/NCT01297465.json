After screening, the subjects will start down-regulation treatment on Day 21-22 of the cycle. Down-regulation treatment will start within 2 months following the screening visit. The routine long luteal phase protocol for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist treatment will be followed. Once down-regulation has been confirmed, a pregnancy test will be performed just before randomization and start of recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) treatment to rule out any pre-existing pregnancy. If the result is negative, the subject will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms of the trial:\n\n* GONAL-f®: (Liquid Pen; 300 international unit \\[IU\\] of per day) stimulation Day 1-5 followed by Pergoveris® (vial/powder, 300 IU per day) from stimulation Day 6 and until required recombinant human chorionic hormone (r-hCG) criterion is met. The dose can be adjusted from stimulation Day 6 (increased or decreased) based upon the subject's ovarian response and according to the center's standard practice.\n* Pergoveris®: (vial/powder, 300 IU per day) from stimulation Day 1 and until required r-hCG criterion is met. The dose can be adjusted from stimulation Day 6 (increased or decreased) based upon the subject's ovarian response and according to the center's standard practice.\n\nRandomization across the two treatment arms will be kept balanced in a 1:1 ratio. Follicular development will be monitored according to the center's standard practice by ultrasound (US) and/or estradiol (E2) levels, until the protocol r-hCG requirement is met (i.e., at least one follicle greater than or equal to \\[\\>=\\] 18 millimeter \\[mm\\] and two follicles \\>=16 mm). After this, a single injection of r-hCG will be administered in order to induce final oocyte maturation.\n\nAt a time of 34-38 hours after r-hCG administration, oocytes will be recovered vaginally under US monitoring. Oocytes will then be fertilized in vitro and embryos replaced 2-5 days after oocyte recovery. Ovum pick up (OPU), in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer (ET) and luteal support will be performed as per center's standard practice.\n\nA post-treatment safety visit will be performed for all subjects who received r-hCG (pregnant and non- pregnant) on Day 15-20 post-hCG. For subjects who have withdrawn from treatment (i.e. after starting Pergoveris® or Gonal-f® but before hCG is given) this visit will take place 20-30 days after their first Pergoveris® or Gonal-f® treatment injection (excluding pregnancy testing).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Number of Oocytes Retrieved","timeFrame":"OPU day (34-38 hours post r-hCG day [end of stimulation cycle {approximately 11 days}])","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gonal-f® Plus Pergoveris®","deltaMin":10.9,"sd":6.5},{"arm":"Pergoveris®","deltaMin":9.7,"sd":6.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"36 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Slovakia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26194884"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":99},"commonTop":["Headache","Abdominal pain","Nasopharyngitis","Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","Vaginal haemorrhage"]}}
