Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Current history of SBS as a result of major intestinal resection, (eg, due to necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, intestinal atresia, or gastroschisis) for at least 12 months prior to screening\n* Short bowel syndrome that requires parenteral nutrition/intravenous (PN/IV) support\n* Stable PN/IV support for at least 3 months prior to enrollment based upon the opinion of the investigator\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Serial transverse enteroplasty or any other bowel lengthening procedure performed within the past 3 months\n* Unstable absorption due to cystic fibrosis, untreated Hirschsprung's disease or known DNA abnormalities (ie, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Fanconi syndrome)\n* Evidence of obstruction on upper gastrointestinal (GI) series
