It is hypothesized that the addition of a third active anti- Hepatitis C Virus (anti-HCV) drug may lead to more rapid viral response than therapy with two drugs, and therefore, the addition of boceprevir to PegIntron plus ribavirin therapy after a 4-week lead-in period may allow for both increased rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) and shorter treatment durations (in some populations) than treatment with PegIntron plus ribavirin alone.\n\nThe study includes two separate cohorts, Cohort I (White participants) and Cohort II (Black participants). Participants from each cohort are assigned (randomized) to one of three study arms, all of which have a 4-week lead-in period with (PEG + RBV).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) Rate","timeFrame":"At Follow-up Week (FW) 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort I - 1.
