The study is designed to compare the efficacy of these currently used capsules with the efficacy of the same treatment provided in a cholic acid capsule that is made by a company that will be marketed after FDA approval.\n\nAt baseline, patients receive established doses of cholic acid capsules prepared at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Pharmacy. During the study, patients receive the same treatment provided in the to-be-marketed (TBM) cholic acid capsule. Hence, patients serve as their own controls, with baseline values presenting the reference value (CCHMC cholic acid capsule) and values after 30 days treatment presenting the value for the investigational treatment (TBM cholic acid capsule).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Serum Transaminases","timeFrame":"At baseline and after 30 days of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cholic Acid","deltaMin":31.4,"sd":21.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15383928","19622360","17682975","16819396"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":16},"commonTop":["Decreased/low 250H/Vit D","Decreased Vitamin A","Nosebleed","Diarrhoea","Reflux"]}}
