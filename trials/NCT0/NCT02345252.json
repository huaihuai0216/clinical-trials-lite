After reaching HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL, single values of HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL followed by resuppression, are allowed\n* Have no documented resistance to any of the study agents at any time in the past\n* HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at the screening visit\n* Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL (≤ 26 μmol/L), or normal direct bilirubin\n* Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm\\^3 (1.00 GI/L); platelets ≥ 50,000/mm\\^3 (50 GI/L); hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL (85 g/L))\n* Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN (individuals with serum amylase \\> 5 × ULN will remain eligible if serum lipase is ≤ 5 × ULN)\n* Normal ECG (or if abnormal, determined by the Investigator to be not clinically significant)\n* Adequate renal function: Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 mL/min (1.17 mL/sec) according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive\n* Hepatitis C antibody positive with detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA (individuals who have HCV antibody but no detectable HCV RNA are eligible to enroll)\n* Individuals experiencing or with a medical history of decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy, etc.)\n* Females who are breastfeeding\n* Positive serum pregnancy test\n* Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with individual's study compliance\n* A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma. Individuals with cutaneous KS are eligible, but must not have received any systemic therapy for KS within 30 days of Baseline/Day 1 and must not be anticipated to require systemic therapy during the study\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Baseline/Day 1\n* Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements\n* Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial\n* Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with any of the disallowed medications listed in the protocol, including drugs not to be used with FTC, RPV and/or TAF;
