The marketed name of the drug is Biktarvy. In two phase 3 comparative clinical trials, including one with ABC/3TC/DTG, it was found to be non-inferior to dolutegravir-containing regimens in terms of virologic outcomes. B/F/TAF was also well tolerated, with few discontinuations for adverse events. As a result, B/F/TAF is an ideal non-abacavir containing regimen to assess the effect of removing ABC on coronary flow reserve.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Global CFR","timeFrame":"baseline and week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HIV Patients on Stable Therapy","deltaMin":-0.05,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37947105"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":["Shortness of Breath"]}}
