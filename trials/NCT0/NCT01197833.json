In this study, patients with varicose veins in the legs will be participating. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of two different doses of an investigational drug, Polidocanol Endovenous Microfoam (PEM) compared to vehicle (inactive solution) when used following an approved heat treatment in subjects with varicose veins.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Absolute Change From Baseline in Independent Photography Review (IPR-V3 Score)","timeFrame":"IPR-V3 measured at baseline and then at 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Endovenous Ablation, Vehicle Placebo","deltaMin":-0.8,"sd":0.102},{"arm":"Endovenous Ablation, Polidocanol Injectable Foam, 0.5%","deltaMin":-1.3,"sd":0.1},{"arm":"Endovenous Ablation, Polidocanol Injectable Foam 1.0%","deltaMin":-1.11,"sd":0.097}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26957489"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["pain in extermity","thrombophlebitis superficial","contusion","pruritis","extravasation"]}}
