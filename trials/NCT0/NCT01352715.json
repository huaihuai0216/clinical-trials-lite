The study also looked at how well participants tolerate the drug regimens and how safe they are.\n\nThe study was designed to determine whether taking the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus raltegravir (RAL) works as well as what is usually used for second-line therapy: LPV/r plus the best-available nucleoside (nucleotide) reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) combination. Testing a regimen that does not include any NRTIs was important because NRTIs may no longer work for patients who received them as part of their first treatment regimen.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cumulative Probability of Virologic Failure by Week 48","timeFrame":"From study entry to week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: LPV/r Plus RAL","deltaMin":10.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: LPV/r Plus Best Available NRTIs","deltaMin":12.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["Brazil","India","Kenya","Malawi","Peru","South Africa","Tanzania","Thailand","Zimbabwe"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33487029","27240787"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":258},"commonTop":["Blood sodium decreased","Blood cholesterol increased","Low density lipoprotein increased","Blood phosphorus decreased","Blood bicarbonate decreased"]}}
