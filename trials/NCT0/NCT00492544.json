GSK Biologicals has developed an HPV vaccine (580299) which targets the 2 most common oncogenic HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18), found in approximately 70% of all cervical cancers. In previous trials, the vaccine has been found to be efficacious in the prevention of incident and persistent HPV-16/18 infections and associated cytological abnormalities. HPV vaccination should ideally be performed before onset of sexual activity. Previous studies showed that GSK Biologicals' HPV vaccine 580299 is safe and immunogenic when administered to European, Asian, Latin American and Australian pre-adolescents and adolescents. Here, we aim to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the GSK Biologicals' HPV vaccine 580299 in healthy Japanese pre-adolescent and adolescent female subjects aged 10-15 years. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects Seroconverted for Anti-human Papilloma Virus 16 (Anti-HPV-16) and Anti-human Papilloma Virus 18 (Anti-HPV-18) Antibodies","timeFrame":"One month post Dose 3 (Month 7)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix Group","deltaMin":92,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":100},"commonTop":["Pain","Redness","Swelling","Fatigue","Headache"]}}
