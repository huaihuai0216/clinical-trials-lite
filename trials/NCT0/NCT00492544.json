In addition, a written informed assent must be obtained from the subject prior to enrolment.\n* Healthy subjects as established by medical history and history-directed clinical examination before entering into the study.\n* All subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test.\n* Subjects must be of non-childbearing potential, or, if of childbearing potential, they must be abstinent or have used adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series. Non-abstinent pre-menarche subjects, as well as subjects who reach menarche during study, must follow the same precautions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or planned during study.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before and 30 days after the first dose of vaccine. Administration of vaccines up to 8 days before the first dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period (up to Month 7), in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Previous vaccination against HPV, or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period (Day 0 to Month 7).\n* Previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine .\n* Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory tests.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding subject.\n* Subject planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.\n* Oral temperature ≥ 37.5°C/Axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"10 Years","maximumAge":"15 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Seroconverted for Anti-human Papilloma Virus 16 (Anti-HPV-16) and Anti-human Papilloma Virus 18 (Anti-HPV-18) Antibodies","description":"Seroconversion is defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and/or anti-HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. antibody titer ≥ cut-off value) in the sera of subjects seronegative before vaccination.\n\nCut-off values were 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units per milliliter (EL.U/mL) for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and 7 EL.U/mL for anti-HPV-18 antibodies.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"92","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Anti-HPV-16 and Anti-HPV-18 Antibody Titers","description":"Titers are given as geometric mean titers (GMTs) calculated on all subjects.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19748.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8765.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited Local Symptoms","description":"Solicited local symptoms assessed include pain, redness and swelling.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"85","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"81","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited General Symptoms","description":"Solicited general symptoms assessed include arthralgia, fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgia, rash, and urticaria.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events (AE)","description":"Unsolicited adverse event= Any adverse event (AE) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study.
