However, subjects with a history of LCT but without current aggressive disease and no current evidence of LCT on pathology in skin and lymph nodes would be eligible.\n* Diagnosed with a malignancy in the past two years. However, subjects with non-melanoma skin cancers, melanoma in situ, localized cancer of the prostate with current PSA of \\<0.1 ng/mL, treated thyroid cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ or ductal/lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast within the past two years could enroll as long as there was no current evidence of disease.\n* Clinical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.\n* Psychiatric illness, disability or social situation that would have compromised the subject's safety or ability to provide consent, or limited compliance with study requirements.\n* Significant uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Known or tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1), hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n* Active herpes simplex or herpes zoster. Subjects on prophylaxis for herpes who started taking medication at least 30 days prior to study entry, and had no active signs of active infection, and whose last active infection was more than 6 months ago, could enter the study, and should have continued to take the prescribed medication for the duration of the study.\n* Experienced allergic reactions to monoclonal antibodies or other therapeutic proteins.\n* Known active autoimmune disease were excluded. (For example, Grave's disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; psoriasis).\n* Was pregnant (confirmed by beta human chorionic gonadotrophin \\[β-HCG\\]) or lactating.\n* History of allogeneic transplant.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression Free Survival","description":"Progression was defined as follows, based on Olsen (2011):\n\n* Lymph nodes: ≥ 50% increase in SPD from baseline of lymph nodes, any new node \\> 1.5 cm in the long axis or \\> 1 cm in the short axis if 1-1.5 cm in the long axis that is proven to be N3 histologically, or \\> 50% increase from nadir in SPD of lymph nodes in those with PR\n* Skin: ≥ 25% increase in skin disease from baseline, new tumors (T3) in patients with T1, T2 or T4 only skin disease, or in those with CR or PR, increase of skin score of greater than the sum of nadir plus 50% baseline score\n* Blood: B0 to B2, \\> 50% increase from baseline and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL36, or \\> 50% increase from nadir and at least 5,000 neoplastic cells/μL\n* Viscera: \\> 50% increase in size (SPD) of any organs involved at baseline, new organ involvement, or \\> 50% increase from nadir in the size (SPD) of any previous organ involvement in those with PR","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"55.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"28.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Response Rate","description":"The ORR was defined as the count of subjects who had a confirmed CR or PR, defined as documented CR or PR per Global Composite Response Score that was confirmed by a subsequent observation at least 4 weeks later.
