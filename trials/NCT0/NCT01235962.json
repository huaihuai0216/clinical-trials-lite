The FKSI-19 is a disease-specific instrument that measures disease and treatment-related symptoms specifically in renal cancer patients in 4 domains. The FWB domain assesses well being in the past 7 days. Participants are asked to respond to 3 questions (\"I am able to work,\" \"I am able to enjoy life,\" and \"I am content with the quality of my life now\") by using a 5-point scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much; possible total domain score of 0 to 12). A negative mean indicates a worsening of condition.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.08","spread":"0.134"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.30","spread":"0.136"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.30","spread":"0.147"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.41","spread":"0.147"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.3","spread":"0.151"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.29","spread":"0.153"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.50","spread":"0.179"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.38","spread":"0.183"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.39","spread":"0.206"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.44","spread":"0.208"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) With Pazopanib vs. Placebo for ITT ALL Assessed Using EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) Score","description":"Health outcome and quality of life measured by using EQ-5D thermometer score and EQ-5D utility index (UI) score.
