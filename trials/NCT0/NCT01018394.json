Long-term ST use is known to increase the risk for oropharyngeal cancer. Extant literature on cigarette smokers suggests that smoking reduction increases smoking abstinence among smokers not interested in quitting. The overarching goal of this line of research is to develop a ST reduction intervention among ST users not interested in quitting tobacco. Our first step is to conduct the proposed pilot study designed to assess the efficacy of the nicotine lozenges or tobacco-free snuff for reducing ST use or facilitating ST abstinence among ST users not interested in quitting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tobacco Abstinence at 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nicotine Lozenges","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tobacco Free Snuff","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23454876"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["sore throat","dizziness","insomnia"]}}
