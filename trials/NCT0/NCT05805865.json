Each tooth was divided into six surfaces, three facial and three lingual, as follows: 1) mesio-facial; 2) mid-facial; 3) disto-facial; 4) mesio-lingual; 5) mid-lingual; and 6) disto-lingual. Teeth included in the scoring were: #3, 7, 12, 19, 23, 28. Plaque was disclosed and scored on each tooth surface according to the following criteria:\n\n0: No plaque.\n\n1. Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin.\n2. A thin, continuous band of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cer- vical margin.\n3. A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than 1/3 of the side of the crown of the tooth.\n4. Plaque covering at least 1/3, but less than 2/3 of the side of the crown of the tooth.\n5. Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the side of the crown of the tooth.\n\nSubject-wise scores were determined by averaging the values obtained over all scorable surfaces in the mouth.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.80","spread":"0.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.78","spread":"0.46"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Gingival Index Score at Baseline","description":"Gingivitis was scored according to the LÃ¶e-Silness Gingival Index.
