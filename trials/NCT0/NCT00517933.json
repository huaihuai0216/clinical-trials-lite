Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (eg, \"confined to bed\"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates better health state.\n\nMean raw scores of EuroQOL Utility.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.71","spread":"0.24"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.74","spread":"0.19"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.75","spread":"0.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.71","spread":"0.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.70","spread":"0.26"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.72","spread":"0.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.04","spread":"0.18"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.02","spread":"0.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.01","spread":"0.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.03","spread":"0.19"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Short Form Health Survey (SF36) General Health - Adjusted Value","description":"The SF36 measures functional health and well-being scores on eight scales that correlate with two aggregate scores.\n\nEach score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better function.\n\nValues adjusted for baseline values of age, height, sex, white race, and DLCO.
