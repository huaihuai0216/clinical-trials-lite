It assesses AB/GI symptoms, among others. Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they experienced AB/GI symptoms in the week prior to assessment. Participants responded on a scale of 1-4 (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much) to the following: Did you have abdominal pain? Did you have a bloated feeling in your abdomen/stomach? Did you have problems with your clothes feeling too tight? Did you experience any change in bowel habit as a result of your disease or treatment? Were you troubled by passing wind/gas/flatulence? Have you felt full too quickly after beginning to eat? Have you had indigestion/heartburn? Data are transformed to a scale from 0 to 100. Lower scores represent better health (fewer symptoms).
