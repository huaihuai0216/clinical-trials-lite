All patients will receive standard chemotherapy with either paclitaxel or topotecan or liposomal doxorubicin. Patients randomized to Arm 2 of the study will receive Avastin (10 mg/kg iv 2-weekly or 15 mg/kg iv 3-weekly) concomitantly. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression. Patients will then receive standard of care, those in Arm 1 (chemotherapy only) may opt to receive Avastin (15 mg/kg iv 3-weekly). Target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression or Death (Data Cutoff 14 November 2011)","timeFrame":"Screening Visit, Every 8 weeks (or 9 weeks if receiving topotecan) until progression reported between day of first participant randomized (29 October 2009) until cutoff date of 14 November 2011","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Chemotherapy","deltaMin":92.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy + Bevacizumab","deltaMin":78.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":117,"countries":["Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Netherlands","Norway","Portugal","Spain","Sweden","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37407274","37185961","28595285","28481967","27871723","24687829","24637997"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":49,"n":181},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Fatigue","Anaemia","Leukopenia","Peripheral sensory neuropathy"]}}
