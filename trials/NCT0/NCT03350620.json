Children aged 3 to â‰¤ 17.0 years.\n2. Myopia SER of at least -0.50 D and no worse than -6.00 D myopia in each eye as measured by cycloplegic autorefraction.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. If present, astigmatism more than -1.50 D in either eye.\n2. Current or history of amblyopia or strabismus.\n3. History of any disease or syndrome that predisposes the subject to severe myopia (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Stickler syndrome, retinopathy of prematurity).\n4. History in either eye of abnormal ocular refractive anatomy (e.g., keratoconus, lenticonus, spherophakia).\n5. Serious systemic illness that, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject ineligible.\n6. Chronic use (more than 3 days per week) of any topical ophthalmic medications (prescribed or over the-counter) other than the assigned study medication.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"3 Years","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects' Eyes That Show < 0.50 D Myopia Progression (SER, Spherical Equivalent Refraction) at the Month 36 Visit","description":"Number of subjects' eyes that show \\< 0.50 D myopia progression (SER, spherical equivalent refraction) at the Month 36 visit.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"79","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"106","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"61","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in SER (Spherical Equivalent Refraction)","description":"Change from baseline in SER (spherical equivalent refraction).","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.85","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.02","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.10","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":164},"commonTop":["nasopharyngitis","COVID-19","headache","seasonal allergy","pyrexia"]}}}
