Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. A decrease in MSCS score reflected an improvement in symptoms; clinically meaningful improvement was indicated by a reduction in the score of 0.30 or more.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.04","spread":"0.773"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.06","spread":"0.731"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.07","spread":"0.801"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.15","spread":"0.791"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.16","spread":"0.746"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.07","spread":"0.806"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.24","spread":"0.797"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.31","spread":"0.667"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.20","spread":"0.764"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.27","spread":"1.027"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.22","spread":"0.643"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.36","spread":"0.677"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.10","spread":"0.657"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) at 4 Hrs Post Dosing, Based on the Patient Assessment of Baseline Severity of Symptoms","description":"The Treatment Outcome Score (TOS)is a validated measure of response to therapy. Response assessment for each symptom complex (internal head/neck, stomach/GI, genital/buttocks, external head/neck or cutaneous) was to be weighted based on the severity of symptom complexes at baseline. Severity assessment at baseline was rated on a categorical scale (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) for symptoms at each affected symptom complex. Response assessment of each symptom complex post-dosing relative to baseline used a scale (100=significant improvement, 50=improvement, 0=same). The weighted values were used to calculate the composite TOS. A TOS greater than 0 denotes an improvement in symptoms compared with baseline severity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"69.80","spread":"35.378"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"70.05","spread":"40.639"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"63.08","spread":"42.840"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"62.65","spread":"42.802"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"65.13","spread":"34.858"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"60.42","spread":"40.866"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"56.20","spread":"34.229"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"79.77","spread":"24.663"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"71.06","spread":"37.270"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.30","spread":"23.556"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"60.94","spread":"45.615"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.92","spread":"43.853"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"64.93","spread":"46.854"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Significant Improvement","description":"Time to significant improvement in overall response based on the period from 15 minutes after dosing through 4 hrs post dosing.
