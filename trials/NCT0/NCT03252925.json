N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a small, simple molecule that began as a generic drug almost 40 years ago. It has since been approved by the FDA for many indications. The investigators conducted an prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficiency of NAC in patients with TA-TMA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Incidence of TA-TMA.","timeFrame":"100 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NAC Group","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24819072","28011677","27284100","26245827"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":66},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain or diarrhea","Hemorrhagic cystitis","Fever","Erythra","Cough or expectoration"]}}
