Diagnosis of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in both lower extremities\n6. Lower extremity pain for at least 6 months\n7. Visual analog scale score of ≥ 40 mm at Initial Screening (0 mm = no pain - 100 mm very severe pain)\n8. Symptoms from the Brief Pain Neuropathy Screening is ≤ 5 point difference between legs at Initial Screening\n9. The average daily pain intensity score of the Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary completed after medication wash-out is ≥ 4 with a standard deviation ≤ 2\n10. The physical examination component of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Score is ≥ 3 at Screening\n11. Subjects on gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), duloxetine (Cymbalta) for painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy at study entry must be on stable regimen of these treatments for at least 3 months prior to study entry\n12. If female of childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test at screening and using acceptable method of birth control during the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Peripheral neuropathy caused by condition other than diabetes\n2. Other pain more severe than neuropathic pain that would prevent assessment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy\n3. Progressive or degenerative neurological disorder\n4. Myopathy\n5. Inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels (inflammatory angiopathy, such as Buerger's disease)\n6. Active infection\n7.

Specific laboratory values at Screening including: Hemoglobin \\< 8.0 g/dL, WBC \\< 3,000 cells per microliter, platelet count \\<75,000/mm3, Creatinine \\> 2.0 mg/dL; AST and/or ALT \\> 3 times the upper limit of normal or any other clinically significant lab abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator should be exclusionary\n13. Ophthalmologic conditions pertinent to proliferative retinopathy or conditions that preclude standard ophthalmologic examination\n14. Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained systolic blood pressure \\> 200 mmHg or diastolic BP \\> 110 mmHg at Screening\n15. Subjects with a recent history (\\< 5 years) of or new screening finding of malignant neoplasm except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (if excised and no evidence of recurrence for one year); subjects with family history of colon cancer in any first degree relative are excluded unless they have undergone a colonoscopy in the last 12 months with negative findings\n16. Use of the following drugs / therapeutics is prohibited. Subjects may participate in the study if they are willing to discontinue use of these drugs / therapeutics 7 days prior to starting the 7 Day Daily Pain and Sleep Interference Diary. Subjects must refrain from taking these drugs or undergoing these therapies for the duration of the study\n\n    * skeletal muscle relaxants, opioids, benzodiazepines (except for stable bedtime dose),\n    * capsaicin, local anesthetic creams (except for lidocaine cream prior to intramuscular injection) and patches, isosorbide dinitrate spray,\n    * transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture\n17. If not using gabapentin (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica), subjects must agree not to start these drugs for the first 180 days of the study. Subjects on these medications at study entry must maintain a stable dose until Day 180 of the study;\n18. If not using duloxetine (Cymbalta), any antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline and venlafaxine), any other antiepileptics (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine, vigabatrin), subjects must agree not to start these drugs for the first 6 months of the study.\n\n    Subjects on these medications at study entry must maintain a stable dose until Day 180 of the study\n19. Subjects requiring \\> 81 mg daily of acetylsalicylic acid; subjects may be enrolled if willing/able to switch to ≤ 81 mg daily of acetylsalicylic acid or to another medication\n20. Subjects requiring regular COX-2 inhibitor drug(s) or non-specific COX-1/COX-2 inhibiting drugs, or high dose steroids (except inhaled steroids or ocular steroids) subjects may be enrolled if willing/able to undergo medication wash-out prior to the first dosing and to refrain from taking these drugs until Day 180 of the study\n21.
