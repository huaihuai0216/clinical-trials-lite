Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving methotrexate and tacrolimus or cyclosporine before and after transplant may stop this from happening. It is not yet known whether donor bone marrow transplant is more effective with or without G-CSF in treating hematologic cancer or other diseases.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Estimated Two-year Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"at 2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control BM Arm","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"Experimental G-BM Arm","deltaMin":83,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":13},"commonTop":["Platelet count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Mucositis oral"]}}
