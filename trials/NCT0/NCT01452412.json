Individuals with kidney disease develop a build-up of acid in their blood. This acid can affect their muscles, bones, glucose metabolism and kidneys. The investigators will test alkali treatment, to treat acid build-up, in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate effects on muscles, bones, glucose metabolism and kidney.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sit to Stand to Sit Speed: Time Taken to Sit to Stand to Sit 10 Times","timeFrame":"2 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sodium Bicarbonate","deltaMin":23.8,"sd":5.8},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":22.9,"sd":6.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34784301","31699517"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":74},"commonTop":["Serum potassium >= 5.0 mEq/L","Serum bicarbonate >=30","Serum bicarbonate <=18","Serum potassium <=3.5"]}}
