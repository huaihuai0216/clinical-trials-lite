The study compares 2 medicines for type 1 and type 2 diabetes - faster aspart (a new medicine) and insulin aspart (a medicine doctors can already prescribe). Participants will either get faster aspart or insulin aspart (NovoRapid®) - which treatment is decided by chance. Both medicines will be taken together with insulin degludec. Participants will need to take 1 injection 4 times every day: 3 injections 0-2 minutes before breakfast, lunch and dinner and 1 injection at the same time every day. All study medicines are provided in pens. A pen is a tool to inject insulin under the skin.The study will last for about 7 months (30 weeks). Participants will have 11 clinic visits and 17 phone contacts with the study doctor. At 8 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 3 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (water is allowed) 8 hours before the visits - at 2 of these visits participants will be asked to drink a liquid meal and to stay at the clinic for about 5 hours. Participants will fill in a diary the last 3 days before the visits/phone contacts. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) (Percentage [%])","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Faster Aspart","deltaMin":-0.57,"sd":0.63},{"arm":"NovoRapid","deltaMin":-0.54,"sd":0.73}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.5102"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":36,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":331},"commonTop":["Diabetic retinopathy","Upper respiratory tract infection","Hyperlipidaemia","Dyslipidaemia"]}}
