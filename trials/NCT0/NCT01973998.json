Hence, investigations of new therapies to treat COPD patients who are hospitalized with a severe exacerbation are desperately needed.\n\nObjective: To test the feasibility of roflumilast to decrease all cause readmission and mortality 180 days after hospitalization for acute COPD exacerbation.\n\nMethods: Parallel-group, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of roflumilast 500 ug daily vs. placebo in approximately 100 hospitalized AECOPD patients. Inclusion Criteria. Primary diagnosis of AECOPD; admission to the hospital \\<12 hours; patient age \\>40, \\< 80 years old; cigarette smoking \\> 10 pack-years. Exclusion Criteria. Prior diagnosis or high suspicion for asthma; pulmonary edema, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease or significant bronchiectasis; intubated and mechanically ventilated at the time of evaluation; active liver disease, or transaminase elevations (\\> 3xULN); history of heavy ethanol use; history of suicidal behavior ≤ 2 years or suicidal ideation ≤ 6 months prior to enrollment; pregnant or lactating females.
