The subject must voluntarily give informed consent to participate in the substudy.\n2. No dose changes to study drug are made within 5 days of the pharmacokinetic (PK)substudy visits.\n3. No additions or deletions to concurrent medications are made within 7 days of the pharmacokinetic substudy visit. Note: changes to diuretics and/or anticoagulants are permitted.\n4. The preceding evening dose of study drug should have been taken 9 to 13 hours prior to the BID dose and 6-10 hours prior to the TID morning dose of study drug to ensure a trough level of study drug for PK sampling.\n5. Subject dosing of study drug on the day of PK sampling must be observed in the clinic by study personnel.\n6. Subject has not experienced a significant loss of blood (\\> 450 mL) within the last 6 weeks of the pharmacokinetic substudy visit.\n7. The subject must not be receiving any CYP 2C8 inducers or inhibitors","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"To Assess the Pharmacokinetics (Mean AM Dose) in Subjects During Twice Daily (BID) Dosing (up to 14 Days Prior to Transitioning to Three Times Daily [TID] Dosing Regimen at PK Visit 1) and up to 35 Days After Transitioning to TID Dosing (at PK Visit 2).","description":"The PK sampling occurred over a 12-hour period in subjects during BID dosing (PK Visit 1) and during TID dosing (PK Visit 2).
