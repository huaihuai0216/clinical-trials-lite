Every participant is asked to rate how severe each problem had been on a scale from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be). The total score is the sum of the scores for all 22 items, ranging from 0 to 110, with a lower score indicating better HRQoL. A negative change from baseline in SNOT-22 is considered a favorable outcome.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-36.4","spread":"32.64"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-39.5","spread":"36.68"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-36.7","spread":"33.44"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-39.6","spread":"30.60"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-79.8","spread":"30.90"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-78.6","spread":"31.77"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-79.1","spread":"30.16"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-81.0","spread":"27.10"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Responders and Non-responders to Treatment, Full Analysis Set","description":"Number of responders and non-responders to treatment based on the assessment of overall response to treatment by the investigator were reported.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"148","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"152","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"151","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"150","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"85","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"83","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"79","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"209","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"206","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"212","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"209","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"18","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"225","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"225","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"230","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"219","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"230","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"226","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"230","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"224","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Responders and Non-responders to Treatment, Per-Protocol Set","description":"Number of responders and non-responders to treatment based on the assessment of overall response to treatment by the investigator were reported.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"138","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"140","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"132","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"134","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"75","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"75","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"80","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"73","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"192","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"190","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"191","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"192","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"15","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"207","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"210","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"209","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"202","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"211","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"210","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"206","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"205","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":235},"commonTop":["Headache","Dyspepsia","Abdominal pain upper","Acute sinusitis","Nausea"]}}}
