The HAM-A consists of 14 items. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 scale. For all of these items, 0 is the \"best\" rating and 4 is the \"worst\" rating. If no item scores are missing, then the HAM-A total score is the sum of all 14 item scores. The possible total scores are from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating worse anxiety symptoms.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.79","spread":"0.45"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.70","spread":"0.43"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With MADRS Response at Week 14 Relative to Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) for the Efficacy Sample.","description":"The MADRS response was defined as \\>/=50% reduction in MADRS total score from end of Phase A (Week 8).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With MADRS Response at Week 14 Relative to Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) for the Efficacy Sample Per the Final Protocol.","description":"The MADRS response was defined as \\>/=50% reduction in MADRS total score from end of Phase A (Week 8).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With MADRS Remission at Week 14 Relative to Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) for the Efficacy Sample.","description":"MADRS remission was defined as \\</=10 and \\>/=50% reduction in MADRS total score from end of Phase A (Week 8).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.38","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With MADRS Remission at Week 14 Relative to Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) for the Efficacy Sample Per the Final Protocol.","description":"MADRS remission was defined as \\</=10 and \\>/=50% reduction in MADRS total score from end of Phase A (Week 8).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.99","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With CGI-I Scale Response Rate at Week 14 Relative to Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) for the Efficacy Sample.","description":"CGI-I response was defined as a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"44.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With CGI-I Scale Response Rate at Week 14 Relative to Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) for the Efficacy Sample Per the Final Protocol.","description":"CGI-I response was defined as a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26.4","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":188},"commonTop":["Weight increased","Upper resporatory tract infection","Akathisia","Diarrhoea"]}}}
