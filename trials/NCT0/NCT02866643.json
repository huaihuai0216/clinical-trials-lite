In this trial, the investigators aim to describe the effects of immediate insertion of the contraceptive implant on breastfeeding. The investigators seek to examine the time to lactogenesis with immediate post-delivery insertion in delivery room versus insertion of a contraceptive implant in the postpartum ward prior to medical discharge. For this study, 82 consenting women will be randomized to immediate implant insertion (0-2 hours following delivery) in the delivery room or insertion of the implant following delivery in postpartum room and prior to medical discharge (24-48 hours following delivery).\n\nParticipants complete a questionnaire that asks questions about breastfeeding continuation, supplementation, duration, and exclusivity. This questionnaire also includes questions about contraceptive continuation, patient satisfaction with implant, pregnancy, and postpartum care visits.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Lactogenesis Stage II [Questionnaire]","timeFrame":"Participants will be monitored daily by the research staff, in the first seven days postpartum, or until lactogenesis reported, beginning at 24-hours following delivery, to determine time to lactogenesis stage II.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Delivery Room Insertion","deltaMin":65,"sd":25.1},{"arm":"Postpartum Insertion","deltaMin":67.5,"sd":35.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26962904","15820365","10029642","9460316","26645197","18672108","18097343","26241255","19661855","21734635","26447268","26996737","24591920","21508750","16531169","19913145","26209863","11110856","12743453","11694638"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":48},"commonTop":[]}}
