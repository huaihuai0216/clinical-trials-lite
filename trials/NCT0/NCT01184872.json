However, patients with cellulitis associated with more serious infection (e.g., surgical wound, diabetic ulcer, deep tissue) can be enrolled (proportion of these patients will be limited to 30%).\n\nInfections for which outcome is difficult to assess:\n\n* Perirectal abscess,\n* Hidradenitis suppurativa,\n* Gangrene,\n* Infected human or animal bites,\n* Multiple infected ulcers at distant sites,\n* Infected burns (only third degree burn wound or wound area of more than 10 cm diameter),\n* Conditions requiring emergency surgery including necrotizing fasciitis.\n\nMedical conditions:\n\n* History of significant allergy or intolerance to Vancomycin or Daptomycin. Hypersensitivity to SSPs penicillins is not an exclusion criterion,\n* Concomitant clinically suspected or confirmed other site of infection or disorder at study entry that may interfere with the evaluation in this protocol,\n* Infections associated with a permanent prosthetic device that will not be removed within 24 hours after enrolment,\n* Known or suspected HIV infection with a CD4+ T-cell count \\< 500/Î¼L (HIV testing is not required),\n* Severe hepatic disease (Child-Pugh Class C) or ALT and/or AST \\> 5 times ULN and/ or total bilirubin \\> 2 times ULN at screening,\n* Calculated creatinine clearance by the Cockcroft-Gault equation using actual body weight \\< 30 mL/min or any type of dialysis,\n* Treatment with any investigational agent or device within 30 days of study drug administration.\n\nExclusion criteria related to medications:\n\n* Previous systemic antibacterial therapy for the treatment of Gram-positive complicated skin and soft tissue infections for more than 24 hours within 48 hours prior to the day of first infusion of study drug unless:\n* The previous antibacterial therapy was administered for 3 or more calendar days with either worsening or no improvement in the clinical signs and symptoms of cSSTIs, and was not Vancomycin or SSPs.\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Patients With Clinical Success at the Test-Of-Cure (TOC) Visit","description":"Success: Clinically significant signs and symptoms associated with the skin infection present at the pre-treatment infection site resolved (cure), or improved without need of further antibacterial therapy.
