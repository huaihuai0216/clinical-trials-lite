The two drug regimens are sapacitabine administered in alternating cycles with decitabine or decitabine alone. The purpose of the study is to learn which drug regimen is more likely to keep AML in check as long as possible.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"up to 43 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sapacitabine-decitabine Alternating","deltaMin":5.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Decitabine","deltaMin":5.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0249"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"70 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":118,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Poland","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34424530"],"seeAlso":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34424530/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":21},"commonTop":["THROMBOCYTOPENIA","ANAEMIA","NEUTROPENIA","CONSTIPATION","NAUSEA"]}}
