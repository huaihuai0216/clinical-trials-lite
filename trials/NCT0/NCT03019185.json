The two eGFR values collected at Screen A and Screen B visits used to determine eligibility must have a percent difference ≤ 25%;\n* Albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) ≤ 3500 mg/g at Screen B visit;\n* If receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and/or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), the medications must remain the same for at least 6 weeks prior to the Screen A visit and during Screening. The dosage of ACE inhibitor and/or ARB must also be stable for 2 weeks prior to the Screen A visit and remain the same through Day 1 (i.e., no change in dosage or medication). Patients not taking an ACE inhibitor and/or ARB because of a medical contraindication must have discontinued treatment at least 8 weeks prior to the Screen A visit;\n* Adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function at the Screen A visit\n* Able to swallow capsules;\n* Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, and other study procedures;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior exposure to bardoxolone methyl;\n* Ongoing chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis therapy;\n* Renal transplant recipient;\n* B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level \\> 200 pg/mL at Screen A visit;\n* Uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c \\> 11.0%) at Screen A visit;\n* Acute dialysis or acute kidney injury within 12 weeks prior to Screen A visit or during Screening;\n* Serum albumin \\< 3 g/dL at Screen A visit;\n* History of clinically significant left-sided heart disease and/or clinically significant cardiac disease, including but not limited to any of the following:\n* Uncontrolled systemic hypertension as evidenced by sitting systolic blood pressure (BP) \\> 160 mm Hg or sitting diastolic BP \\> 100 mm Hg at Screen A visit after a period of rest;\n* Systolic BP \\< 90 mm Hg at Screen A visit after a period of rest;\n* History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Screen A visit, with the exception of localized skin or cervical carcinomas;\n* Systemic immunosuppression for more than 2 weeks, cumulatively, within the 12 weeks prior to randomization or anticipated need for immunosuppression during the study;\n* Untreated or uncontrolled active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection;\n* Participation in other interventional clinical studies within 30 days prior to Day 1;\n* Unwilling to practice acceptable methods of birth control (both males who have partners of child-bearing potential and females of childbearing potential) during Screening, while taking study drug, and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug is ingested;\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;\n* Known hypersensitivity to any component of the study drug","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) After 12 Weeks of Treatment (Phase 2)","description":"To assess the change in eGFR from baseline to week 12 (Phase 2).
