Researchers also want to learn how insulin levels will be affected by metformin, diet and/or exercise.\n\nMetformin is designed to treat both diabetes and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a condition in which the body makes insulin but does not use it properly. It is often referred to as \"pre-diabetes\". Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both sugar and insulin in their blood at the same time, which have been reported in patients with endometrial cancer.\n\nIn this study, metformin will be compared to a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.\n\nLifestyle intervention is made up of a series of in-person sessions where you meet with a coach to discuss strategies for losing weight and ways to increase physical activity. It also consists of materials designed to help you lose weight and will offer opportunities for supervised exercise.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"To Evaluate the Participant Body Weight in Pounds (Lbs)","timeFrame":"Visit 2 (1 week), 4 months, and 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin + Lifestyle","deltaMin":108.57,"sd":22.51},{"arm":"Metformin + No Lifestyle","deltaMin":99.3,"sd":15.36},{"arm":"Placebo + Lifestyle","deltaMin":101.64,"sd":13.44},{"arm":"Placebo + No Lifestyle","deltaMin":94.1,"sd":12.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.006"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":7},"commonTop":["Flatulence","Headache","Diarrhea","Abdominal pain","Nausea"]}}
