This stems from the prevalence of trainee operators coupled with the non-specific nature of loss-of-resistance. In the current randomized trial, we will set out to compare conventional and epidural waveform analysis-confirmed loss-of-resistance. The investigators' research hypothesis is that loss-of-resistance combined with epidural waveform analysis will decrease the failure rate of thoracic epidural blocks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With Successful Epidural Blocks","timeFrame":"up to 15 minutes after the procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Conventional Loss-of-resistance","deltaMin":76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Waveform-confirmed Loss-of-resistance","deltaMin":98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Canada","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["Transient self-resolving paresthesia","Vascular breach"]}}
