Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and radiation and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether chemoradiotherapy plus peripheral stem cell transplantation is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemoradiotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation to see how well they work compared to combination chemotherapy in treating patients with stage II, stage III, or stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"2-year Overall Survival Rates","timeFrame":"up to 2 years post registration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CHOP/CHOP-R x 3","deltaMin":71.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"CHOP/CHOP-R x 1 + Autologous Stem Cell Transplant","deltaMin":73.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24625415","24171516"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":123},"commonTop":["Leukopenia","Neutropenia/granulocytopenia","Anemia","Lymphopenia","Fatigue/malaise/lethargy"]}}
