The study will compare budesonide-MMX™ 6 mg and budesonide-MMX™ 9 mg tablets to placebo and to Entocort® 3 x 3 mg capsules, in four parallel groups of patients over an 8 week treatment period.\n\nAfter the screening visit, patients will enter a washout period of 2 days, then they will be randomised to the following four treatment groups: budesonide-MMX™ tablets (6 mg), budesonide-MMX™ tablets (9 mg), Entocort® capsules (3 x 3 mg) and placebo (tablets and capsules), all administered once a day after breakfast. Hence, each patient will receive, in the morning after breakfast, either one budesonide-MMX™ 6 mg or budesonide MMX™ 9 mg tablet and 3 placebo Entocort® matching capsules, or three Entocort® 3 mg capsules and one placebo budesonide-MMX™ matching tablet, or one placebo budesonide-MMX™ matching tablet and three placebo Entocort® matching capsules.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical and Endoscopic Remission.","timeFrame":"8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1: Budesonide-MMX® 6 mg","deltaMin":8.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"2: Budesonide-MMX® 9 mg","deltaMin":17.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"3: Entocort EC® 3 mg","deltaMin":12.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"4: Placebo","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.2876"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0047"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0481"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":71,"countries":["Australia","Belgium","Estonia","France","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Poland","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23436336"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":128},"commonTop":["Colitis ulcerative","Headache","Abdominal pain","Flatulence","Nausea"]}}
