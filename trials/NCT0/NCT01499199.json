The study will be conducted in approximately 14 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na√Øve subjects. Subjects who fulfill eligibility requirements will receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg once daily in combination with the fixed dose dual nucleoside reverse transcripatase inhibitor(NRTI) abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) for 96 weeks. One pair of pharmacokinetic (PK) samples in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (matching time) for determination of DTG concentration will be collected at Week 2 and Week 16. Samples for plasma HIV-1 RNA will be collected at Baseline and various time points throughout the study and samples for HIV-1 RNA levels in the CSF will be collected at Baseline, Week 2 and Week 16. Safety, additional measures of antiviral activity and development of viral resistance will also be evlauated. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 16 weeks on therapy; additional analyses will be conducted after the last subject completes Weeks 2 and 96 (end of study).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Ratio of Total and Unbound DTG Concentrations Between Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) and Plasma at Week 2 and Week 16","timeFrame":"Week 2 and Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dolutegravir 50 mg OD","deltaMin":0.516,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24944232"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":13},"commonTop":["Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Haemorrhoids","Fatigue"]}}
