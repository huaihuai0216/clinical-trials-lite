Moreover, 5,819 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG-only) procedures were performed in the VA in Fiscal Year (FY) 1999. Throughout VA and non-VA cardiac surgery programs nationwide, myocardial revascularization is now being performed using two surgical techniques. One technique is performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) usually with cardioplegic arrest (\"on-pump\") and the other without CPB on a beating heart (\"off-pump\"). The overall purpose of this proposed randomized, controlled, clinical trial is to rigorously evaluate the impact of using an on-pump versus off-pump surgical technique for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG-only) procedures (performed with a traditional median sternotomy incision) upon patient clinical outcomes and resource utilization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Short-term End Point","timeFrame":"30 day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"On Pump","deltaMin":61,"sd":null},{"arm":"Off Pump","deltaMin":77,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19890125","23916805","31001997","29653645","26470910","25442992","22592900","21978872","21130476"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":201,"n":1099},"commonTop":[]}}
