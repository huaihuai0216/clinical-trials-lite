This is to compare the effect on body weight in teenagers taking semaglutide (a new medicine) and teenagers taking \"dummy\" medicine. The teenagers in the study and their parents will also have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more physically active and what they can do to help the teenagers lose weight. The teenagers will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment is decided by chance. The teenagers will take 1 injection every week, on the same day of the week for about 15 months. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The teenagers will have 17 clinic visits, will have blood samples taken and will have to complete questionnaires and keep a diary. All this will be explained before study start.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Mass Index (BMI) (Percentage [%])","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 68","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-16.2,"sd":12.9},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.1,"sd":8.6}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Croatia","Ireland","Mexico","Russia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36322838","37196421","36534451","35797460"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":133},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Diarrhoea","Headache","COVID-19"]}}
