Evaluate zoledronate effect on new bone fractures 5. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid (with calcium and vitamin D) versus standard treatment (calcium and vitamin D alone).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) T-Score From Baseline to 12 Months","timeFrame":"From baseline to 12 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vitamin D + Calcium Carbonate","deltaMin":0.08,"sd":0.34},{"arm":"Vitamin D + Calcium Carbonate + Zoledronic Acid","deltaMin":-0.09,"sd":1.23}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23276888"],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":37},"commonTop":[]}}
