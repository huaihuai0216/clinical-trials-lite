An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects a foreign substance, called an antigen. The mechanism of an antibody is to attack an antigen. In antibody mediated rejection, antibodies will attack the transplanted heart, causing injury to the heart. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if a study drug, called eculizumab (Soliris), is safe to use in heart transplant recipients, and determine if it reduces risk of antibody-mediated rejection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants of Pathologic Antibody-Mediated Rejection and Left Ventricular Dysfunction","timeFrame":"up to 26 weeks post heart transplant","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Eculizumab","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19632573","17614978","19416767","12531414","21942930","17954062","21300295","21555100","18976298","17878341","9171898","7657827","37182818","33251691"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":36},"commonTop":[]}}
