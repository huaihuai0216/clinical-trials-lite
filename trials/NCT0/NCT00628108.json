Subjects having values outside the accepted reference range can be included if in the Investigator's opinion, they are of no clinical significance\n* Personal history of seizure, febrile seizure or sleep apnea\n* Below the lower 5th or above 95th percentile for body weight and/or height based upon CDC Growth Charts for Body Weight and Length\n* Allergy or intolerance to levocetirizine dihydrochloride or its excipients, or to any other piperazine derivatives, such as hydroxyzine, cetirizine, cyclizine, meclozine, buclizine\n* Current or past intake (including exposure through breast milk) of the following medications within the specified wash-out period before the Randomization Visit (V2):\n\n  * Systemic corticosteroids within the past 28 days\n  * Leukotriene-receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast \\[Singulair\\] or zafirlukast \\[Accolate\\] within the past 7 days)\n  * Mast-cell stabilizers (e.g. cromolyn or nedocromil) within the past 7 days\n  * Other antihistamines or cough and cold preparations (with the exception of single ingredient guaifenesin products), or over-the-counter (OTC) sleep aid medications within the past 7 days\n  * Systemic antibiotics within the past 7 days\n  * Other concomitant medications that will interfere with the study, in the opinion of the investigator\n* Previous participation in another clinical/pharmacological trial within the past month prior to V1\n* Have already participated in this study or participated in this study at another site\n* Children of any member of the study site staff\n* Sibling with sleep apnea or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)\n* Exposure to other conditions known to be potential risk factors for SIDS, such as but not limited to (this should be determined on a case by case basis taking into account the subject's entire medical history and environmental living conditions):\n\n  * Mothers who smoked or abused drugs during pregnancy\n  * Extremely young mothers (defined as age 19 or younger when pregnant)\n  * Children currently exposed to a caregiver which is a heavy cigarette smoker (defined as smoking at least a pack of cigarettes per day)\n  * Babies who sleep regularly on their face or are not put to sleep on their backs\n  * Premature birth gestational age â‰¤ 37 weeks) or low birth weight (below 10 percentile for
