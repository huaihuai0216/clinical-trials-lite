Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether cisplatin combined with irinotecan is more effective than cisplatin combined with etoposide in treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of cisplatin combined with either irinotecan or etoposide in treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Weekly while on treatment, then every 3 months for first year, then every 6 months unitl a maximum of 3 years from enrollment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cisplatin + Irinotecan","deltaMin":9.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cisplatin + Etoposide","deltaMin":9.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":408,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19349543","16648503"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":107,"n":321},"commonTop":["Fatigue/malaise/lethargy","Anemia","Nausea","Neutropenia/granulocytopenia","Leukopenia"]}}
