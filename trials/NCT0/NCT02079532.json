MabThera-naive patients will be stratified into 3 arms, according to previous inadequate response to a)etanercept, b)infliximab or c)adalimumab. Patients will be treated with MabThera (1g infusion) on day 1 and day 15, and will continue their basic methotrexate therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is 2+ years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28)","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab + MTX","deltaMin":-1.56,"sd":1.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":69,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":302},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Hypertension"]}}
