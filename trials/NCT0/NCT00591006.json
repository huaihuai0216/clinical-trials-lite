This research also seeks to determine if patients taking phenytoin before corticosteroids show more activity in the area of the brain involved with memory than those receiving placebo.\n\nThis research is being done because increased levels of cortisol (the body's natural corticosteroid) in the body are frequently associated with forgetfulness, and interventions that may prevent or reverse this effect are of great importance.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Difference in RAVLT Total T-Score Between Treatments","timeFrame":"At end of each treatment condition (on average 21 days between treatments)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phenytoin&Hydrocortisone","deltaMin":57.76,"sd":0.51},{"arm":"Placebo&Placebo","deltaMin":56.11,"sd":0.67},{"arm":"Phenytoin&Placebo","deltaMin":53.08,"sd":0.45},{"arm":"Placebo&Hydrocortisone","deltaMin":42.76,"sd":2.6}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.01"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".12"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":".15"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":".10"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":16},"commonTop":[]}}
