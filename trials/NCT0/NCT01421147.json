A hypoglycemic event is defined as any time a participant feels that he/she is experiencing a sign or symptom that is associated with hypoglycemia, or has blood glucose (BG) concentration of â¤ 70 milligrams/deciliter \\[mg/dL (3.9 millimoles/liter (mmol/L)\\], even if it was not associated with signs, symptoms, or treatment consistent with current guidelines (ADA 2005). Severe hypoglycemia is defined as a hypoglycemic event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions (these episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma; also, BG measurements may not be available during such an event). Nocturnal hypoglycemia is defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between bedtime and waking.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.10","spread":"6.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.32","spread":"6.58"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":"0.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.01","spread":"0.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.50","spread":"1.93"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.51","spread":"1.77"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.33","spread":"5.64"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.56","spread":"6.12"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.01","spread":"0.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.01","spread":"0.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.32","spread":"1.66"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.42","spread":"1.60"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":268},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Back pain","Gastroenteritis"]}}}
