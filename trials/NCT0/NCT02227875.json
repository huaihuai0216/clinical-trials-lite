who also fulfill the following:\n\n  * Diagnosis established 1 year prior to screening\n  * Insulin-naïve OR\n  * On Lantus® once daily at stable dose (±15% variation in dose) for at least 3 months prior to screening\n* Body mass index (BMI) of 18.50 to 40.00 kg/m2 at screening (both values inclusive).\n* Stable weight, with no more than 5 kg gain or loss, in the 3 months prior to screening; this information will be collected by patient interview during medical history.\n* Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL at screening\n* Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of \\<10.5% or between 7.5 to 10.5% for insulin naïve patients at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of hypersensitivity to any of the active or inactive ingredients of the insulin/insulin analog preparations used in the trial, OR history of significant allergic drug reactions.\n* History of use of animal insulin within the last 3 years, any insulin other than Lantus® within the last 3 months prior to screening, or use of biosimilar insulin glargine at any time prior to screening.\n* Patients requiring basal-bolus insulin therapy or who in the opinion of the investigator require mealtime insulin in order to achieve glycemic control.\n* Regular use of immune-modulator therapy in the 1 year prior to screening.\n* History of ≥2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia within the 6 months before screening or history of hypoglycemia unawareness (a sample questionnaire is provided in Appendix I) as judged by the investigator.\n* History of ≥1 episode of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma or emergency room visits for uncontrolled diabetes leading to hospitalization within the 6 months prior to screening.\n* Serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HbSAg) or hepatitis C (HCVAb) antibodies at screening.\n* History of drug or alcohol dependence or abuse during the 1 year prior to screening.\n* Receipt of another investigational drug in the 3 months prior to screening (or as per local regulations), or if the screening visit is within 5 half-lives of another investigational drug (whichever is longer), or scheduled to receive another investigational drug during the current trial period.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65
