There are four functional scales (body image, sexual enjoyment, sexual functioning, future perspective \\[FP\\]) and four symptom scales (systemic side effects \\[SE\\], upset by hair loss, arm symptoms, breast symptoms). Questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Scores averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score for functional scale indicated high/better level of functioning/healthy functioning. Higher scores for symptom scales represent higher levels of symptoms/problems. For functional scales, positive change from baseline indicated improvement in quality of life (QOL) while negative change from baseline indicated a deterioration. For symptom scales, positive change from baseline indicated deterioration and negative change indicated improvement.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard
