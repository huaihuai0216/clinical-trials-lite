Suicidal behavior is defined as a \"yes\" answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as treatment-emergent (TE) if not present at baseline. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"66","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Questionnaire up to Week 20 (Open-label Period)","description":"Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Questionnaire is a 5-item rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm.
