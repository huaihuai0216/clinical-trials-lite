The study will also evaluate if sitagliptin treatment, compared to glimepiride results in improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and plasma lipid levels after 30 weeks of treatment. Participants will be randomized to either sitagliptin or glimepiride treatment after eligibility for study participation is determined during screening and washout study phases. Participants and study staff will not know to which treatment group they have been randomized (double-blind design). The duration of study participation will be up to 40 weeks (with 9 clinic visits). This will include a screening phase (Visit 1 to Visit 2) of 2 weeks maximum; a 6-week (Visits 2 to 3) oral antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) wash-out phase (for those who have been taking a AHA prior to the study); a placebo run-in phase (Visits 3 to 4), followed by up to 30 weeks of treatment with study medication.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Least Squares (LS) Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 30","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":-0.32,"sd":0.78},{"arm":"Glimepiride","deltaMin":-0.51,"sd":0.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26041585"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":241},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Hyperglycaemia","Hypoglycaemia"]}}
