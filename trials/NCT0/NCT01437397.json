This study will also assess the effects of the fixed dose combination in terms of COPD symptoms, disease related health status and the long-term safety and tolerability of the fixed dose combination. This study will include a 24 week treatment period, preceding by a run-in period, followed by a two week follow up visit. All patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms or placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in 1-hour Morning Post-dose Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"Week 24 of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aclidinium/Formoterol 400/12 μg","deltaMin":0.247,"sd":0.013},{"arm":"Aclidinium/Formoterol 400/6 μg","deltaMin":0.226,"sd":0.013},{"arm":"Aclidinium 400 μg","deltaMin":0.139,"sd":0.013},{"arm":"Formoterol 12 μg","deltaMin":0.165,"sd":0.013},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.037,"sd":0.014}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":222,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31827323","28558833","27215749","26233481","25756831"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=4060&filename=CSRsynopsis_redacted.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":335},"commonTop":["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Nasopharyngitis","Cough"]}}
