It is estimated that in 2005, about of 20,000 new cases of CL were diagnosed in Colombia.\n\nSo far, pentavalent antimony compounds have been considered the treatment of choice with a percentage of cure of about 85%. However, the high efficacy of these drugs is counteracted by their adverse events and disadvantages. Previous studies have shown that miltefosine could be a potential alternative of treatment for CL.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of miltefosine or thermotherapy for the treatment for CL. In this study the efficacy of oral treatment of miltefosine 150 mg/day for 28 days or a thermotherapy device used for one session at 50 celsius degrees during 30 seconds will be compared with the standard treatment of intramuscular injections of 20 mg/Kg/day of pentavalent antimonials (GlucantimeÒ) for 20 days in CL parasitologically proven patients.\n\nThis trial will be conducted according to the International approved GCP (Good Clinical Practice) guidelines.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Complete Clinical Response","timeFrame":"Until 6 months posttreatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Miltefosine","deltaMin":85,"sd":null},{"arm":"Glucantime®","deltaMin":103,"sd":null},{"arm":"Thermotherapy","deltaMin":86,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Colombia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12219128","11280058","12219126","3606662","13678842","11241940","2405727","9311641","7235124","6837841","6091468","1538157","10513726","12377584","3037735","1974943","1677544","2221221","7886779","8889330","9886195","1311351","2173461","16619185","1329624","7922300","14580961","1659239","15614453","8384011","8304565","8966312","8966308","9747313","17361854","12908038","15741547","11937930","12891748","12668576","15563366","9023651","9851383","1325463","15127339","23740007","22594858"],"seeAlso":["http://pecet-colombia.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":145},"commonTop":["Cephalea (End of treatment)","Nausea (End of treatment )","Anorexia (End of treatment )","Myalgia (End of treatment)","Arthralgia (End of treatment)"]}}
