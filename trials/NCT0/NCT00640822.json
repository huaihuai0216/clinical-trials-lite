the trunk and/or the limbs, or earlier diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk and/or the limbs\n* An extent of psoriatic involvement of the face of at least 10 cm2 (the sum of all facial lesions)\n* Treatment areas (the face and the intertriginous areas) amenable to topical treatment with a maximum of 10 g of ointment per day\n* Disease severity graded as mild, moderate, severe or very severe according to the investigator's global assessment of disease severity of the face\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Systemic treatments with all other therapies than biologicals, with a potential effect on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids, immunosuppressants) within the 4-week period prior to randomisation\n* Systemic use of biological treatments, whether marketed or not, directed against or with a potential effect on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) within 3 months prior to randomisation\n* PUVA therapy or Grenz ray therapy within the 4-week period prior to randomisation\n* UVB therapy within the 2-week period prior to randomisation\n* Topical treatment of the face and the intertriginous areas within the 2-week period prior to randomisation (use of emollients is allowed on treatment areas during this 2-week period, but not during the study)\n* Topical treatment with very potent WHO group IV corticosteroids within the 2-week period prior to randomisation\n* Initiation of or expected changes in concomitant medication that may affect psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., beta blockers, anti-malaria drugs, lithium and ACE inhibitors) during the study\n* Systemic treatment with vitamin D preparations above 500 IU per day\n* Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative, guttate or pustular psoriasis\n* Patients with any of the following conditions present on the treatment area: viral (e.g., herpes or varicella) lesions of the skin, fungal and bacterial skin infections, parasitic infections, skin manifestations in relation to syphilis or tuberculosis, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris, atrophic skin, striae atrophicae, fragility of skin veins, ichthyosis, acne rosacea, ulcers and wounds\n* Other inflammatory skin diseases (e.g., seborrhoeic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and cutaneous mycosis) that may confound the evaluation of psoriasis vulgaris on the face or on the intertriginous areas\n* Planned exposure to sun, UVA or UVB that may affect the psoriasis vulgaris during the study\n* Known or suspected severe renal insufficiency or severe hepatic disorders\n* Known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism associated with hypercalcemia","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
