There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 and Part 2.\n\nPart 1 consists of 2 cohorts, starting with a sentinel cohort, in which participants will be enrolled to receive open-label TAF in addition to their current failing ARV regimen. This cohort will then be followed by a randomized, double-blind, cohort to compare the addition of TAF or placebo in HIV-1 positive adults who are failing their current ARV regimen.\n\nIn Part 2, all participants who complete Part 1 of the study will discontinue their failing ARV regimen and TAF or placebo for a 14-day washout period. Following the washout period, all participants who received TAF in Part 1 and have a \\> 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will receive elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) single-tablet regimen (STR) plus atazanavir (ATV) once daily for 48 weeks. Participants who received TAF who have a ≤ 0.5 log10 decline in HIV-1 RNA will be discontinued from the study and will not be eligible to continue into Part 2 of the study. All participants who received placebo in Part 1 will be eligible to participate in Part 2 regardless of their viral load change. After completion of Part 2, all participants will be eligible to continue to receive E/C/F/TAF plus ATV in the extension phase until E/C/F/TAF becomes commercially available, or until Gilead Sciences terminates development of E/C/F/TAF in the applicable country.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part 1: Percentage of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA Decreases From Baseline Exceeding 0.5 log10 at Day 10","timeFrame":"Day 10","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 1 Sentinel Cohort TAF","deltaMin":58.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 1 Randomized Cohort TAF","deltaMin":60.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 1 Randomized Cohort Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Dominican Republic","Russia","Thailand","Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Malaria","Neuropathy peripheral","Toothache","Hyperbilirubinaemia"]}}
