This was repeated for each foot condition. VO2 at the steady state was recorded in ml/min and were subsequently converted to calories and and then to Watts. The data were then corrected for body weight by dividing by weight in Kg. The gross VO2 in Watts/Kg during walking were then adjusted to net VO2 in Watts/kg by subtracting the resting metabolic rate.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.45","spread":"0.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.13","spread":"0.33"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.97","spread":"0.23"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Prosthetic Foot Push Off Peak Power","description":"The biomechanical measurement of the power generated by the prosthetic foot during the push off component of stance phase.
