There are few effective treatments - compression therapy (tight bandaging or stockings) helps healing, but about half the people with a VLU remain unhealed even after 12 weeks of treatment. Research suggests taking aspirin as well as using compression may speed up healing for VLU, but the current evidence is not enough to change clinical practice. We will conduct a randomised controlled trial to test whether using low dose aspirin (150 mg daily or placebo) really does speed up healing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Complete Healing of Reference Ulcer","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aspirin","deltaMin":77,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":69,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.246"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26708314","29175902"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":125},"commonTop":["Laceration and contusions","Bleeding from any lower leg ulceration","Infection of ulceration, any lower leg ulceration","Developed any new lower leg ulceration","Extension of reference ulceration"]}}
