There are 5 domains of the IIEF: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. The Erectile Function (EF) domain of the IIEF is used to assess specific key components of ED including ability to achieve penetration and ability to maintain erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. A score of 0-5 is awarded to each question of the IIEF. The EF domain pertains to questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 15. Scores are totaled and ranges are assigned to results. In the EF domain, a score of 0-30 is possible. The EF scores can be interpreted as follows: 0-6 severe dysfunction, 7-12 moderate dysfunction, 13-18 mild to moderate dysfunction, 19-24 mild dysfunction, and 25-30 no dysfunction.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.84","spread":"7.492"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.84","spread":"8.704"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes in American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index","description":"The American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index is used to evaluate the severity of the patient's enlarged prostate symptoms.
