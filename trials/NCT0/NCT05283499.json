heavy machinery while taking the study medication will be able to participate.\n* Subjects who are English speaking and are able to provide consent will be considered.\n* Subjects must be in generally good health and able to take ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and hydrocodone.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects who self-report the following history will be excluded from participating:\n\n* Individual under the age of 18\n* History of gastrointestinal bleeding and/or peptic ulcer\n* History of renal disease (excluding kidney stones)\n* History of hepatic disease\n* History of bleeding disorder\n* History of respiratory depression\n* Any prior respiratory effect of an opioid or other anesthetic drug that required respiratory support postoperatively\n* Active or untreated asthma\n* History of known allergic reaction to ibuprofen, acetaminophen, hydrocodone, and/or anesthesia\n* Currently taking any of the following medications:\n\n  * CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), which may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen and prolong opioid adverse reactions, and which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression\n  * CNS depressants.\n* Consumes 3 or more alcoholic drinks every day and/or has a history of alcoholism\n* History of drug or alcohol abuse (excludes marijuana use)\n* Family history of drug or alcohol abuse in a first degree relative\n* Has had one or more opioid prescription
