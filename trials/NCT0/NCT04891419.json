The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug and no more than 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"59","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Participants With at Least a 1-Point Improvement (Decrease) in Temple as Assessed by the Evaluating Investigator (EI) Using the Allergan Temple Hollowing Scale (ATHS)","description":"The Evaluating Investigator will assess the participant's temple hollowing using the ATHS 5-point scale where: 0=convex, rounded temple to 4=severe, deeply recessed, sunken appearance.
