It will provide an answer to a common clinical question, namely, is it better to increase the dose of the current monotherapy or to combine both treatments early on, in patients who do not respond to standard doses of duloxetine or pregabalin.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Week 8 to Week 16 Endpoint in 24 Hour Average Pain Item Score on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Modified Short Form","timeFrame":"Week 8, Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Combination","deltaMin":-2.353,"sd":null},{"arm":"Monotherapy","deltaMin":-2.161,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.370"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":54,"countries":["Australia","Canada","Croatia","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":401},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Somnolence","Nausea","Fatigue","Headache"]}}
