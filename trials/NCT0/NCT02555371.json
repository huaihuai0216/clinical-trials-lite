Continuous treatment with mepolizumab is defined as no more than 2 consecutive missed doses (no treatment gaps of more than 12 weeks \\[84 days\\] between any two doses).\n* Current Anti-Asthma Therapy: Asthma is currently being treated with a controller medication and the subject has been on a controller medication for the past 12 weeks. Subjects will be expected to continue controller therapy for the duration of the study.\n* Male or Eligible Female Subjects: A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Non-child bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Post-menopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, \\> 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy.\n\nOR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to acceptable contraceptive methods approved in their local country, when used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician) for the duration of the study and for 4 months after the last study drug administration.\n\nA urine pregnancy test is required of all females of child-bearing potential at each scheduled study visit prior to the injection of study treatment, and at the Exit Visit, Early Withdrawal (EW) or Discontinuation of IP Visit.\n\n* French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* MEA115666 or 201312 IP Discontinuation: Subjects withdrawn from IP or withdrawn from study participation from either MEA115666 or 201312 for safety reasons.\n* Health Status: Clinically significant deterioration in health status at the completion of participation or EW from either the MEA115666 or 201312 trials which in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject unsuitable for participation in this study.\n* Pregnancy: Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Subjects should not be enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of study participation.\n* Cardiovascular: Subjects who have severe or clinically significant cardiovascular disease uncontrolled with standard treatment. Including but not limited to:\n\nknown ejection fraction of \\<30% OR severe heart failure meeting New York Heart Association Class IV classification OR hospitalised in the 12 months prior to Visit 1 for severe heart failure meeting New York Heart Association Class III OR angina diagnosed less than 3 months prior to Visit 1 or at Visit 1.\n\n* 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): ECG which has a clinically significant abnormality observed at the Screening Visit as determined by the investigator. Subjects with the following abnormalities are excluded from study participation: QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) \\> 450 milliseconds (msec), or QTcF \\>480 msec for subjects with Bundle Branch Block.\n* Malignancy: A current malignancy or previous history of cancer in remission for less than 12 months prior to screening (Subjects that had localized carcinoma of the skin which was resected for cure will not be excluded).\n\nNote for South Korea: Korean subjects with a diagnosis of malignancy within 5 years are excluded.\n\n* Other Monoclonal Antibodies: Subjects who have received any monoclonal antibody (other than XOLAIRÂ®) to treat inflammatory disease within 5 half-lives of Visit 1.\n\nXOLAIR is a registered trademark of Genentech USA, Inc. and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.\n\n* Adherence: Subjects who have known evidence of lack of adherence within studies MEA115666 or 201312 (less than 80%) to controller medications, scheduled study visits and/or ability to follow physician's recommendations.\n* Smoking status: Current smokers\n* Inability to read: In the opinion of the Investigator, any subject who is unable to read and/or would not be able to complete a questionnaire.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With First Clinically Significant Exacerbation in Part C","description":"Clinically significant exacerbation was defined as worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) for at least 3 days or a single intramuscular (IM) corticosteroid dose and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visits.
