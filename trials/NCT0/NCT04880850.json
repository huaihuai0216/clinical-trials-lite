Which treatment participants will get is decided by chance. Participants will also get a mealtime insulin.The insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm or stomach.\n\nThe study will last for about 8 months. participants will have 17 clinic visits and 13 phone calls with the study doctor.At 8 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 4 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit. Participants will be asked to wear a sensor that measures their blood sugar all the time in 3 periods for a total of 13 weeks (about 3 months) during the study.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Icodec","deltaMin":-1.16,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Insulin Glargine","deltaMin":-1.18,"sd":0.05}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":81,"countries":["United States","Belgium","India","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Netherlands","Romania","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36106652","37156252","40465144","40186685","39344833"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":291},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Diabetic retinopathy","Diarrhoea"]}}
