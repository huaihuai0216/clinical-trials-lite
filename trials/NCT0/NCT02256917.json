Because trough FVIII levels are likely to be important predictors of the efficacy of prophylaxis, the focus of this study is on pharmacokinetic (PK) data.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Total Bleeding Rate of Individually Tailored Prophylaxis","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Individualized Prophylaxis in GENA-21b","deltaMin":4.67,"sd":6.46},{"arm":"GENA-01","deltaMin":58.08,"sd":30.78}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":30,"countries":["United States","Canada","Croatia","Finland","France","Japan","Netherlands","North Macedonia","Slovenia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":58},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Arthralgia","Pyrexia","Influenza"]}}
