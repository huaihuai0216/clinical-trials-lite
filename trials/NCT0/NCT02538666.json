The purpose of this study is to show that nivolumab, or nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by nivolumab by itself, will prolong overall survival when administered as consolidation treatment in patients that are stable or responding after chemotherapy. Patients receiving treatment will be compared with patients taking placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) of Nivolumab + Ipilimumab Versus Placebo In The Global Population","timeFrame":"From randomization to 400 deaths across the two treatment groups (Nivo+Ipi vs Placebo) (up to approximately 37 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Global Placebo","deltaMin":9.56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Global Nivolumab 1 mg/kg + Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg","deltaMin":9.17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3693"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":197,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Colombia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Romania","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35383114","33683919"],"seeAlso":["https://www.bms.com/researchers-and-partners/clinical-trials-and-research.html","https://www.BMSStudyConnect.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":117,"n":273},"commonTop":["Decreased appetite","Fatigue","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Cough"]}}
