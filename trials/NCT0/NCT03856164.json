This is the first trial to utilize a prophylactic dose of TXA prior to incision followed by a subsequent prophylactic dose at placental delivery in obstetric patients undergoing scheduled cesareans. The purpose of this study is to quantify blood loss during uncomplicated repeat cesarean deliveries with and without TXA. The central hypothesis is that TXA administration reduces blood loss and fibrinolysis in women undergoing repeat cesarean sections.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Blood Volume Loss","timeFrame":"24 hours postpartum.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tranexamic Acid","deltaMin":2274,"sd":469},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2407,"sd":388}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25545654","23586122","18819848","27733286","28456509","28937571","29490690","10400410","22495893","19459866","16581405","26241269","22397329","29091560","25103301","27512800","30134136","35038612"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":55},"commonTop":[]}}
