Often conventional measures such as warming up or minimizing exposure to cold are not enough and many patients require treatment with a vasodilator therapy. A recent study showed a good efficacy and safety profile of sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in RP.\n\nHere, the investigators aim to examine the efficacy and safety of Udenafil, a newer PDE5 inhibitor, as compared to amlodipine, a well known calcium channel blocker, in the treatment of secondary RP in Korean patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"RP Attacks Per Day","timeFrame":"baselin and 4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Amlodipine","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":1.4},{"arm":"Udenafil","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":0.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24352340"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":26},"commonTop":["Facial flushing","Facial edema","Peripheral edema","Headache","Blurred vision"]}}
