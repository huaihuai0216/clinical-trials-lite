Trough FEV1 is defined as the clinic visit (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 measurement taken at the clinic visit at the end of the dosing interval. Pre-dose and pre-rescue albuterol/salbutamol trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry in the evening at the Baseline through Week 24 clinic visits. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline was the pre-dose value obtained at Visit 2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 24 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.015","spread":"0.0394"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.161","spread":"0.0398"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.159","spread":"0.0406"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour (hr) Periods at the End of the 24-week Treatment Period","description":"The number of inhalations of rescue bronchodilator, albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol, used during the day and night was recorded by the participants in a daily electronic diary (eDiary).

The AQLQ contains 32 items in 4 domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). For the 32 items on the questionnaire, the response format consists of a seven-point scale, where a value of 1 indicates \"total impairment\" and a value of 7 indicates \"no impairment.\" The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates \"total impairment\") to 7 (indicates \"no impairment\").
