In a person with haemophilia A, the clotting process is slowed and the person experiences bleeds that can result in serious problems and potential disability.\n\nThe current standard treatment for severe haemophilia A is regularly scheduled infusion of FVIII to keep levels high enough to prevent bleeding. Due to the short half-life of FVIII, prophylaxis may require treatment as often as every other day.\n\nIn this trial safety and efficacy of a long-acting recombinant factor VIII molecule is evaluated in subjects with severe Hemophilia A.\n\n120-140 patients will receive open label treatment with long-acting rFVIII either on-demand to treat bleeds or prophylactically for 36 weeks in the main trial plus an optional extension to continue treatment for at least 100 total exposure days (ED). Patients on prophylactic treatment will receive study drug at dosing intervals between once and twice a week depending on their observed bleeding. Patients will attend the treatment centre for routine blood samples and be required to keep an electronic diary.\n\nMale patients aged 12-65, with severe hemophilia A, previously treated with FVIII for at least 50 exposure days may be eligible for this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Number of Total Bleeds in On-demand Treatment Arm (Weeks 0 -36) and in Each Prophylaxis Arm (Weeks 10 - 36, Excluding Rescue Bleeds) - Part A, Main Trial","timeFrame":"On-demand: Weeks 0 -36 and Prophylaxis: Weeks 10 - 36 during Part A","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BAY94-9027 On-demand Treatment, Main Trial","deltaMin":23.42,"sd":null},{"arm":"BAY94-9027 Prophylaxis Treatment, 2x/Week Failed, Main Trial","deltaMin":4.11,"sd":null},{"arm":"BAY94-9027 Prophylaxis Treatment, 2x/Week Forced, Main Trial","deltaMin":1.93,"sd":null},{"arm":"BAY94-9027 Prophylaxis Treatment, Every 5 Days, Main Trial","deltaMin":1.93,"sd":null},{"arm":"BAY94-9027 Prophylaxis Treatment, Every 7 Days, Main Trial","deltaMin":3.85,"sd":null},{"arm":"BAY94-9027 Prophylaxis Treatment Total, Main Trial","deltaMin":2.09,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":59,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Colombia","Denmark","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Romania","Singapore","South Korea","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30654111","31621991","27992112","37113811"],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":134},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Headache","Back pain","Procedural pain"]}}
