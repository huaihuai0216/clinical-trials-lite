However, it depends on the depth of the wounds and patient condition. Infection is one of the most common complications causing delay in wound healing which might affect to quality of patient's life. Generally, the standard treatment of partial thickness burn wound is topical 1% silver sulfadiazine cream. Previous studies had been reported the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of silver sulfadiazine cream but it did not demonstrate the accelerating effect of wound healing. Therefore, the combination of substance which can promote wound healing to topical silver sulfadiazine cream might benefit for partial thickness burn wound treatment.\n\nThe objective of this study was to compare the results of partial thickness burn wound treatment at burn unit, Siriraj hospital with topical cream containing 1% silver sulfadiazine plus 6% epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 1% silver zinc sulfadiazine. The demographic data (age, sex, %body surface area burn), time of wound closure, pain and itching, dose and type of pain and itching medication, adverse effect of topical medication, some laboratory results and cost of expenses.\n\nThis is the prospective, double blinded, randomize-controlled study. The sample sizes were partial thickness burn wound patients who were treated at burn unit, Siriraj hospital. Patients were allocated into 2 groups receiving treatment with either topical silver sulfadiazine plus EGF or silver zinc sulfadiazine. All parameter data were analyzed with repeated measure ANOVA and independent t-test.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time of Healing by Monitoring Duration (Days) at the Beginning of Treatment and the Day of Completely Epithelialization (Complete Epithelialization Means no Open Wound Exists as Confirmed by Two Surgeons).","timeFrame":"On 28th day after admission","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Epidermal Growth Factor With Silver Sulfadiazine Cream","deltaMin":23.06,"sd":5.21},{"arm":"Silver Zinc Sulfadiazine Cream","deltaMin":30.94,"sd":7.34}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":[]}}
