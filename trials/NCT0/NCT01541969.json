An a priori hypothesis targeted normalized delta rhythm. Band powers were calculated as percent change in delta brainwave pattern relative to change in total (1-90 Hz) EEG band. Comparison made between 'visit 2' and 'visit 6'.\n\nWe used a Neuroscan system (SynAmps2 model 8050, Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC, USA) and custom cap with 66 equidistant scalp electrodes (Easycap, GmbH, Germany). A central frontal electrode was used as ground and a nose-tip electrode as reference. Electrode impedances were maintained at 5 kÎ© prior to recordings. Recording was done with an offline filter of 0.5 to 200 Hz pass-band and 1 kHz sampling rate. Recording was over a continuous 10-minute period. Participants were seated in a quiet, darkened soundproof booth and were instructed to relax, keep eyes open and fix gaze on a marker point.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.001","spread":"0.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.004","spread":"0.013"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ)","description":"Change in the global score on a 27 item, multi-attribute questionnaire measure of the functional impact of tinnitus (0-100 scale).
