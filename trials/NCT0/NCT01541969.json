It is hypothesised that the particular pattern of sound stimulation delivered by the device acts to break up patterns of synchronous nerve firing in the brain that may be responsible for the sensation of tinnitus. We will also measure brain activity in a subset of participants to determine if the intervention results in changes in brainwave activity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ)","timeFrame":"Baseline (visit 2) and 12 weeks (visit 6)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CR Neuromodulation","deltaMin":3.75,"sd":13.29},{"arm":"Tinnitus Masking","deltaMin":4.02,"sd":9.56}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25478690","23842505","26415998","26584760","27039256","35326273"],"seeAlso":["http://www.hearing.nihr.ac.uk/research/a-systematic-evaluation-of-the-acoustic-cr-neuromodulation-treatment-for-ti"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["Tinnitus worsened"]}}
