use following registration) within the 4-week period prior to randomisation, except for biologics (3 months)\n* Planned exposure to sun during the study that may affect psoriasis vulgaris\n* Previously randomised to this study\n* Subjects known or suspected of not being able to comply with a trial protocol (e.g. due to alcoholism, drug dependency or psychotic state)\n* Females of
