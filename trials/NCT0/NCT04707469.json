Participants will be initiated on the lowest starting dose of 3 mg and gradually increased until they reach the final trial dose of 14 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg once daily semaglutide tablets. The final three doses will be randomized (i.e., decided by chance). Participants will be administered one tablet per day for 68 weeks. Women cannot take part if they are pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become pregnant during the study period. Women who can get pregnant will be checked for pregnancy via urine tests. Once daily semaglutide tablets (3 mg, 7 mg and 14 mg) are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the US, in the EU and in some other countries, under the brand name RybelsusÂ®.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) (Week 52)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 14 mg","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":1.3},{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 25 mg","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":1.3},{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 50 mg","deltaMin":-2.1,"sd":1.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0006"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":181,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bulgaria","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","Germany","Hungary","India","Poland","Puerto Rico","Slovakia","Slovenia","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37385279"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":534},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Diarrhoea","COVID-19","Decreased appetite"]}}
