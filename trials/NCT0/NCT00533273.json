Before treatment, eligible subjects were stratified by the primary joint type (30 metacarpophalangeal \\[MP\\] joints and 30 proximal interphalangeal \\[PIP\\] joints) and by severity of the primary joint contracture (ie, up to 50° or \\>50° for MP joints and up to 40° or \\>40° for PIP joints) and then randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo. Upon completion of the double-blind phase (ie, 90-day evaluation after the first injection), all subjects were eligible to enter the open-label extension phase of the study in which they were followed for an additional nine months. Subjects who required further treatment because they either did not achieve reduction in contracture to 5° or less, the cord affecting the primary joint received placebo, another cord received less than three injections of AA4500, or they had untreated cords that were affecting other joints had the option to receive up to five additional injections of AA4500 0.58 mg in the open-label extension phase, with individual cords receiving up to three injections of AA4500.\n\nThis study was designed to be part of the larger clinical program, for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture with a palpable cord, where the data from 2 pivotal Placebo-Controlled studies (AUX-CC-857 \\[NCT00528606\\] and AUX-CC-859 \\[NCT00533273\\]) and 7 non-pivotal studies were evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Reduction in Primary Joint Contracture to 5° or Less","timeFrame":"Within 30 days after last injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AA4500 0.58 mg","deltaMin":44.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["Australia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/125338lbl.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":63},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Contusion","Pain in extremity","Injection site pain","Injection site haemorrhage"]}}
