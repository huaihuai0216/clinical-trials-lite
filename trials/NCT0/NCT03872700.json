Examples of chronic pain syndromes include sickle cell anemia, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and peripheral neuropathies.\n* Medical condition that might affect metabolism or opioid analgesics such as cirrhosis (Child Pugh A or worse) or kidney impairment (CKD 3 or worse)\n* Chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (dehydration of blood loss) or hepatic disease\n* Alcohol intoxication: history of alcoholism or the presence of alcohol intoxication as judged by the treating physician may alter pain perception and has previously increased adverse events.\n* SBP \\<100 mmHg: Opioids can produce peripheral vasodilation causing orthostasis.\n* HR \\< 60/min: Opioids can cause bradycardia.\n* Oxygen saturation \\< 95% on room air: For this study, oxygen saturation must be 95% or above on room air in order to be enrolled.\n* Use of MAO inhibitors in past 30 days: MAO inhibitors have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant respiratory depression or coma.\n* Patients using transdermal pain patches or oral opioid use \\> 10 days in the prior month: frequent opioid use may influence both the amount of pain patients report as well as the level of relief they obtain from other treatments.\n* Patients with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizures or hallucinations\n* Patients with anatomical anomalies or medical conditions precluding intranasal administration","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"64 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Pain Score at Baseline","description":"Patient reported pain scores at baseline.
