To determine eligibility for randomization, all participants will undergo multimodal CT or MRI at baseline. Only participants with a vessel occlusion (ICA or MCA M1/M2) and penumbral tissue will be randomized. The primary analysis is to compare the efficacy of tenecteplase versus placebo in all participants at Day 90.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Ordinal Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) Score at Day 90","timeFrame":"Day 90","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tenecteplase","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":31,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":97,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38329148","35369714","35262424"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":91,"n":218},"commonTop":["Haemorrhagic transformation stroke","Urinary tract infection","Hypokalaemia","Haemorrhagic infarction","Headache"]}}
