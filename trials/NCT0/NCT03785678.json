If both a CT perfusion and a multimodal MRI scan are performed prior to enrollment, the later of the 2 scans is assessed to determine eligibility. Only an intracranial MRA is required for patients screened with MRA; cervical MRA is not required. Cervical and intracranial CTA are typically obtained simultaneously in patients screened with CTA, but only the intracranial CTA is required for enrollment.\n\nAlternative neuroimaging:\n\n* If CTA (or MRA) is technically inadequate: Tmax\\>6s perfusion deficit consistent with an ICA or M1, M2 occlusion AND target mismatch profile (ischemic core volume \\<70 mL, mismatch ratio \\>= 1.8 and mismatch volume \\>= 15 mL as determined by RAPID software)\n* If magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) is technically inadequate: ICA or M1, M2 occlusion (carotid occlusions can be cervical or intracranial; with or without tandem MCA lesions) by MRA (or CTA, if MRA is technically inadequate and a CTA was performed within 60 minutes prior to the MRI) AND diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volume \\<=25 mL for an M1 or ICA occlusion and =\\<15 mL for an M2 occlusion\n* If CTP is technically inadequate: patient can be screened with MRI and randomized if neuroimaging criteria are met.\n* Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nGeneral\n\n* Current participation in another investigational drug or device study\n* Active internal bleeding\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to any ingredients of tenecteplase\n* Known bleeding diathesis\n* Known hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency;
