The investigators hypothesize that treatment with Nitazoxanide will reduce the duration of symptoms in patients with confirmed influenza infection. Secondarily, the investigators hypothesize that treatment with nitazoxanide will reduce the complications of influenza, severity of symptoms, time lost from work, time to return to normal daily activities.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Resolution of All Clinical Symptoms of Influenza as Reported by the Subjects","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nitazoxanide 300mg","deltaMin":109.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":116.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nitazoxanide 600mg","deltaMin":95.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24852376"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":201},"commonTop":["Mild Diarrhea","Chromaturia"]}}
