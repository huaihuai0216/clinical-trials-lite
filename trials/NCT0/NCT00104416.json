LAMICTAL extended-release is an investigational drug. Placebo tablets look like LAMICTAL extended-release tablets but do not contain active medication. In this study, LAMICTAL extended-release or placebo tablets will be added to current seizure treatments.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Primary Generalized Tonic-clonic (PGTC) Seizure Frequency During the Entire Double-Blind Treatment Phase","timeFrame":"Baseline through end of Double-Blind Treatment Phase (up to Week 19)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double-Blind Phase: Placebo","deltaMin":32.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-Blind Phase: LTG XR","deltaMin":75.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":146,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Chile","Germany","India","Malaysia","Puerto Rico","Russia","South Korea","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20937567"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":74},"commonTop":["Headache","Dizziness","Pyrexia","Vomiting","Nausea"]}}
