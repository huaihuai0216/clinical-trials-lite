In the vast majority of smoking cessation studies and in clinical practice, when smokers are provided a medication to help them quit, they are expected to continue that medication regardless of how well it is working. This study will assess whether African Americans smokers respond better if they continue with a single treatment or if their treatment is changed when that treatment is not working.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Biochemically Verified Smoking Abstinence at Week 12","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care (UC)","deltaMin":23,"sd":null},{"arm":"Optimized Care (OPT)","deltaMin":34,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39976595","37338906","36387983"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":196},"commonTop":["Redness/swelling/rash on the skin","Nausea or Vomiting","Sleeping Problems"]}}
