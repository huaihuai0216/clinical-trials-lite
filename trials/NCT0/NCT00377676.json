Prescription sympathomimetic drugs were not allowed for any period greater than ten (10) consecutive days during the course of the study. Other ergot alkaloid derivatives or anti-migraine medications such as zolmitriptan (Zomig) and sumatriptan (Imitrex) were not permitted during the study.\n* Subject who had a history of alcoholism or drug abuse in the three (3) years prior to the first screening visit.\n* Subject who had a known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation components of the study drug.\n* Subject who had received any experimental drug or used an experimental device in the 30 days prior to the first screening visit or would do so during the study.\n* Subject who was pregnant or lactating women or women planning to become pregnant during the study. Women of childbearing potential had to have a negative pregnancy test at screening. Women who became pregnant were discontinued from the study.\n* Subject who had given donations of blood during the 30 days prior to the screening visit. Donation of blood also was prohibited during the study and for 30 days after completion of the study.\n* Subjects with clinically significant major organ system disease, such as\n\n  * seizure disorder\n  * significant gastroparesis or orthostatic hypotension (autonomic neuropathy)\n  * cerebrovascular accident in the previous 6 months\n  * uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP \\>160 or diastolic BP \\> 100 at screening)\n  * coronary artery bypass graft or coronary angioplasty in the previous 3 months, myocardial infarction in the previous 6 months, or unstable angina pectoris (chest pain at rest, worsening chest pain, or admission to the ER or hospital for chest pain) within the previous 3 months\n  * congestive heart failure defined by NYHA as Class III or IV\n  * clinical nephrotic syndrome, or renal impairment with a serum creatinine \\> 1.4 mg/dl if female receiving treatment with metformin, \\> 1.5 mg/dl if male receiving treatment with metformin, and \\> 1.6 mg/dl in not on metformin\n  * impaired liver function, including having AST or ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal\n  * active infection (e.g., HIV, hepatitis), or a history of severe infection during the 30 days prior to screening\n  * major surgical operation during the 30 days prior to screening\n  * cancer, other than non-melanoma skin or non metastatic prostate cancer within the past 5 years\n  * Any concurrent illness, other than diabetes mellitus, not controlled by a stable therapeutic regimen\n* Working rotating, varying or night shifts\n* Patients taking unapproved herbal supplements that may be associated with a risk of cardiovascular events (such as ephedra, yohimbe etc)\n* Patients who had started therapy with an erectile dysfunction drug within 2 weeks prior to screening; patients could not begin treatment with an erectile dysfunction drug during the study period; patients previously taking erectile dysfunction drugs could do so only under medical supervision.\n* Subjects with circumstances or abnormalities (e.g., blindness or a history of non-compliance) that would interfere with the interpretation of safety or efficacy data or completion of the study.\n* Clinically significant abnormalities (values outside the normal range) on screening central laboratory evaluation unless discussed with and approved by the study principal investigator or Sponsor medical monitor.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Subjects Experiencing Serious Adverse Events","description":"Number of subjects reporting all-cause Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) for usual drug therapy plus Cycloset vs. that for usual drug therapy (UDT) plus placebo from baseline to week 52.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"176","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Subjects Experiencing Serious Cardiovascular Adverse Events","description":"The secondary safety endpoint is number subjects with occurrences of first cardiovascular SAE (myocardial infarction, stroke, in-patient hospitalization for heart failure, angina or revascularization surgery).","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in HbA1c From Baseline to Week 24 in Subjects Failing Treatment With Metformin Plus a Sulfonylurea","description":"Change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 in subjects failing treatment with metformin plus a sulfonylurea with failure defined as having a baseline HbA1c value of ≥ 7.5%.
