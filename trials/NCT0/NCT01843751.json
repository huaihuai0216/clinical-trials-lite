The results will provide justification for the expanded involvement of primary care in the treatment of substance-related disorders (opioid dependence in particular) and the prevention of their complications. As such, the project answers to federal calls for the expansion of substance abuse treatment into primary care settings and to objectives within the Alcohol and Drug Focus Area of Healthiest Wisconsin 2020.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With New Crime","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Physician Office","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Specialist Center","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":[]}}
