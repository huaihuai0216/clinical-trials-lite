PC20 less than 16 mg/ml during Visit 1\n* If FEV1 less than 70% and greater than or equal to 50% predicted normal pre-bronchodilator: demonstrate 12% reversibility during Visit 1 or within past 12 months\n* Currently on stable dose of daily inhaled steroids for asthma control, i.e., inhaled corticosteroid equivalent to 400 ug/day of fluticasone44 or greater for 8 weeks or longer\n* Poor asthma control: Either of the following; a score of 1.5 or greater on the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire; two or more episodes of asthma symptoms in the past 12 months with each episode requiring at least one of the following: an emergency department visit, unscheduled physician visit, prednisone course, hospitalization\n* Non-smoker for 6 months or longer\n* Less than 10 pack/year smoking history\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Surgery: Previous anti-reflux or peptic ulcer surgery\n* Pulmonary function: FEV1 less than 50% predicted normal pre-bronchodilator\n* GERD Symptoms: Severe reflux constituting a clinical indication for treatment with a PPI or H2 blocker, typically two or more episodes per week of heartburn requiring antacids\n* Other major chronic illnesses; conditions which in the judgment of the Study Physician would interfere with participation in the study, e.g., non-skin cancer, endocrine disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, severe hypertension, Type 1 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, renal failure, liver disorders, immunodeficiency states, major neuropsychiatric disorder\n* Medication use: Anti-reflux medication (proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers) within 1 month Theophylline, azoles, iron, anti-coagulants, insulin (for Type I diabetes), digitalis, any investigative drugs within 1 month\n* Drug allergy: Previous adverse effects from proton pump inhibitors or methacholine challenge\n* Females of childbearing potential: Pregnant or lactating, unwilling to practice an adequate birth control method (abstinence, combination barrier and spermicide, or hormonal)\n* Inability or unwillingness to provide consent\n* Inability to perform baseline measurements\n* Completion of less than 10 of the last 14 days of screening period diary entry\n* Inability to be contacted by telephone\n* Intention to move out of the area within 6 months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Exacerbation Components: >=30% Drop in Peak Expiratory Flow on 2 Consecutive Days","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Exacerbation Components: Urgent Care Visit","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Episodes of Poor Asthma Control (EPAC) From Diary Cards, According to Definition That Did Not Include Use of Beta-agonists as a Criterion","description":"Episodes of poor asthma control was defined as any one of the following: 2 consecutive days with a drop in peak flow \\>=30% of baseline;
