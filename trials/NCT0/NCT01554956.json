The concomitant presence of other ligneous pseudomembranes at different sites will not constitute an exclusion criterion.\n* Subjects should have documented historical records of disease course available for a period of at least 6 months surrounding an episode of LC, even if asymptomatic in the past for a newly diagnosed subject , including but not limited to age of LC onset, diagnosis of Plasminogen 1 deficiency, history of pseudomembrane lesions, disease duration, past treatment for LC, response to treatment and/or surgery (including regression and recurrence), before study entrance. If more history than 6 months surrounding an LC episode is available it will be included.\n* Subjects, or their legally authorized representative, in the case of study participants \\< 18 years of age, should have been informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provision, signed and dated the informed consent approved by the investigational review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC).\n* Subjects available for the duration of the study will be included. The Investigator will make sure that there is no plan for the subject to leave the area of the study site before the end of the study period. If they come from another center, they must agree to be compliant with the protocol mandated study visits and return for follow-up.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects presenting ligneous conjunctivitis not associated with Type 1 plasminogen deficiency.\n* Subjects with no history of LC lesions for Group 2, for Group 1 the entry lesions could be the first and included as history.\n* Subject presenting antibodies against plasminogen at screening.\n* Subjects with any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives, or participation in this trial.\n* Subjects unwilling to give written informed consent or assent to participation.\n* Subjects who have participated in another clinical trial within 1 month before study initiation, i.e. they have received any test drug within 30 days prior the study.\n* Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant or not using an adequate method of birth control\n* Females who are breastfeeding.\n* Subjects being treated with FFP or Laboratory Grade Plasminogen will undergo a washout period of at least 15 days before being considered for this study. This information will be disseminated to subjects ahead of their Screening Visit and will only occur following signing of the Informed Consent","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Success to Prevent Pseudomembranes Relapse","description":"The primary endpoint (prevention of pseudomembrane relapse) was presented descriptively based on the predefined success levels: complete success (defined as no relapse by the end of Segment 2), partial success(defined as relapse appearing 2 weeks or longer after the start of Segment 2, or if following the 3 rd cycle of Segment 2 for Group 1A no relapse occurred while maintaining the higher dose) or failure (defined as relapse within 2 weeks of the start of Segment 2 or if at repeat cycles of Segment 1 for Group 1A, the pseudomembranes did not regress after Segment 1).
