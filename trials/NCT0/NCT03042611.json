Failure or intolerance to at least 2 prior lines of standard chemotherapies with each containing one or more of the following agents:\n\n   * fluoropyrimidine (intravenous \\[IV\\] 5-fluorouracil \\[5-FU\\] capecitabine, or S-1),\n   * platinum (cisplatin or oxaliplatin),\n   * taxanes (paclitaxel or docetaxel) or epirubicin,\n   * irinotecan,\n   * trastuzumab in case of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive,\n   * ramucirumab\n   * nivolumab\n   * pembrolizumab\n5.

Expected survival of ≥12 weeks, in the opinion of the investigator.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of another malignancy within 2 years prior to randomization except for the following: Bladder tumors considered superficial such as noninvasive (T1a) and carcinoma in situ (CIS); Curatively treated cervical CIS; Thyroid papillary cancer with prior treatment; Carcinoma of the skin without melanomatous features; Prostate cancer which had been surgically or medically treated and not likely to recur within 2 years.\n2. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases as shown by radiology records or clinical evidence of symptomatic CNS involvement in the last 3 months prior to randomization.\n3. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or other targeted therapies within 3 weeks (4 weeks in cases of ramucirumab, mitomycin C, nitrosourea, lomustine; 1 week in case of biopsy) prior to randomization (Adjuvant radiotherapy given to local area for non-curative symptom relief is allowed until 2 weeks before randomization.).\n4. Therapy with clinically significant systemic anticoagulant or antithrombotic agents within 7 days prior to randomization that may prevent blood clotting and, in the investigator's opinion, could place the participant at risk.\n5. Participants who had therapeutic paracentesis of ascites (\\>1 Liter \\[L\\]) within the 3 months prior to starting study treatment or who, in the opinion of the investigator, will likely need therapeutic paracentesis of ascites (\\>1L) within 3 months of starting study treatment.\n6. Previous treatment with rivoceranib.\n7. Known hypersensitivity to rivoceranib or components of the formulation.\n8.
