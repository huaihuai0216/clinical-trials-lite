Vascular filling may also have an impact on tolerability of enteral nutrition. The earliness and quantity of calories provided by enteral nutrition may have an impact on morbidity and mortality. This study will asses the effects of volume expansion on hemodynamics and tolerability of enteral nutrition in patients with severe sepsis. A Data Monitoring Committee will review regularly safety data of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Amount of Study Drug Required to Achieve Initial Hemodynamic Stabilization","timeFrame":"until hemodynamic stabilization (up to 48 hours)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Voluven速 Arm","deltaMin":1379,"sd":886},{"arm":"NaCl 0.9 % Arm","deltaMin":1709,"sd":1164}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0185"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["France","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22624531"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":100},"commonTop":["Hypotension","Hypoxia","Hyperchloraemia","Hypokalaemia","Hypoproteinaemia"]}}
