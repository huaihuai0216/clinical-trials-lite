Using probiotics as an adjunct to medical therapy might be useful in the treatment of UC and improving the symptoms of the disease. The result of studies that investigate the role of Probiotics supplementation in improving the inflammatory response, immune response and life quality of patients with the UC is not conclusive. So, this study aimed to study the effect of probiotics on the response of inflammatory markers, immune response, and quality of life in patients with UC.\n\nAn interventional double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) design will be used in this study. Forty patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to the placebo group (n=20) to receive 3 times a day placebo capsules; and probiotics group (n=20), to receive 3 times a day probiotic supplement. The demographic data, anthropometric measurements, IBD Quality of Life Questionnaire and blood samples will be collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of follow up. Interleukin-6, interleukin-1,interleukin-10 IL-10, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and complete blood count (CBC) will be measured.\n\nThe results will approve or disapprove the beneficial effect of using probiotics as adjuvant therapy for UC patients to raise the immune system as well as improving their quality of life.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Level of Immunoglobulin (Ig) A","timeFrame":"at the end of 6 weeks of follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":270.42,"sd":71.79},{"arm":"Probiotic Group","deltaMin":208.63,"sd":85.84}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Jordan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29173520","22795953","27150635","27525288","30502748","21991534","31272578","30837080","30632114","22196482","28404201","27507542","37498369","36184252"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
