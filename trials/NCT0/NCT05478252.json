However, short term insulin treatment for a maximum of 14 days and prior insulin treatment for gestational diabetes are allowed.\n* Uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. Verified by a fundus examination performed within 90 days before screening or in the period between screening and randomisation. Pharmacological pupil-dilation is a requirement unless using a digital fundus photography camera specified for nondilated examination.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"64 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","description":"Change in HbA1c from baseline (week 0) to end of treatment (week 28) is presented.
