Since this medication has independently shown promise in helping with ADHD and cocaine abuse, we are proposing that it may be successful in the treatment of comorbid ADHD and cocaine abuse. We plan to enroll 75 subjects in a 14-week trial. The primary objectives of the study are to determine the efficacy of ER-MAS in promoting cocaine abstinence and improvement in ADHD symptomology among cocaine-dependent patients with comorbid ADHD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Last Three Weeks of Cocaine Abstinence Based on Urine Toxicology Results and Self Reported Use","timeFrame":"weekly for 14 weeks of trial or for length of participation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adderall-XR 60 mg","deltaMin":18,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adderall-XR 80 mg","deltaMin":30,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25887096"],"seeAlso":["http://www.stars.columbia.edu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":43},"commonTop":["Anxiety","Insomnia","Dry Mouth","Decreased Appetite","Fidgety/Jittery"]}}
