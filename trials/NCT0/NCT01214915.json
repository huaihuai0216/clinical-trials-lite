The study will aim to show that platelet counts can be safely reduced in treated patients to below 600 x 10\\^9/L after a minimum of three months treatment. To demonstrate an positive effect platelet levels will need to remain below 600 x 10\\^9/L for at least 4 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects Who Responded in Platelet Count","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Anagrelide Hydrochloride","deltaMin":67.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25160063"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":53},"commonTop":["ANAEMIA","HEADACHE","PALPITATIONS","DIARRHOEA","OEDEMA PERIPHERAL"]}}
