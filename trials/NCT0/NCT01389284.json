surgical removal of up to two impacted third molars, one of which must be mandibular full or partial bony impaction and the other a maxillary impaction\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least 1 month prior to screening (3 months on oral contraceptives), e.g., oral or patch contraceptives, intrauterine device, NuvaRing, Depo-Provera, or double-barrier and have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and prior to surgery\n* Have not taken any form of medication or herbal supplements (ie, St. Johns Wort) within 5 days of admission (except for oral contraceptives, prophylactic antibiotics, or other routine medications to treat benign conditions, such as antibiotics to treat acne) and agree not to take any medication (other than that provided to them) throughout the study\n* Have not consumed alcoholic beverages, or foods and beverages containing xanthines (examples, coffee, tea, chocolate, and colas) after midnight prior to surgery and agree not to consume any of these foods or beverages throughout the evaluation period\n* Use of only short-acting local anesthetic (e.g., mepivacaine or lidocaine) preoperatively, with or without vasoconstrictor and nitrous oxide\n* Have moderate to severe postoperative pain on the Categorical Pain Intensity Scale (a score of at least 2 on a 4 point scale) and a score of â‰¥ 50 mm on the 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) within 4 hours postsurgery, but no later than 1330 hours +/- 15 minutes\n* Understand the pain rating scales (as judged by the study coordinator)\n* Be willing and able to participate in all scheduled visits, treatment plan, tests and other trial procedures according to the protocol\n* Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent form (ICF) indicating that the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial, (subjects \\< 18 years of age must sign a written assent and have parental or guardian consent)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of hypersensitivity to naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS), aspirin, hydrocodone, similar pharmacological agents

cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic diseases, or malignancies within the last 5 years\n* Relevant concomitant disease such as asthma (exercise induced asthma is permitted), chronic sinusitis or nasal structural abnormalities causing greater than 50 percent obstruction (polyposis nasi, marked septal deviation) that can interfere with the conduct of the study in the judgment of the investigator\n* Current or past history of gastrointestinal bleeding or other bleeding disorder(s)\n* Acute illness or local infection prior to surgery that can interfere with the conduct of the study in the judgment of the investigator\n* Use of any Over-the-Counter (OTC) or prescription medications with which the administration of naproxen, acetaminophen, ibuprofen or any other NSAIDs, Lortab, is contraindicated or use of any medications within 5 days of surgery (except oral contraceptives, prophylactic antibiotics or medications to treat benign conditions such as antibiotics to treat acne)\n* Females who are pregnant or lactating\n* Habituation to analgesic drugs (i.e., routine use of oral analgesics 5 or more times per week for greater than 3 weeks)\n* Alcoholism or drug abuse within 2 years prior to the Screening Visit or routine consumption of 3 or more alcohol containing beverages per day\n* Positive urine, alcohol or nicotine test on day of surgery\n* Smokers or
