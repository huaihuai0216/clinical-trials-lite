People with DM and JDM can develop calcium deposits in places they should not, known as calcinosis. Calcinosis can be painful and cause disabilities and other problems. Researchers want to learn more about calcinosis to find treatments for it.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo test if sodium thiosulfate (STS) can treat people with DM with calcinosis.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople ages 7 and older who have moderate or severe calcinosis. They must have stable DM and calcium deposits in the torso or at least 2 limbs.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Muscle strength and function tests\n* Blood and urine tests\n\nParticipants will have several visits:\n\n* 7-day pre-treatment visit about 10 weeks before starting STS\n* Treatment visits over 10 weeks. They will get STS 3 times a week through IV infusion. They may be hospitalized the whole time. If they tolerate the drug, they may be discharged at certain times. During these times, they will return for the infusions.\n* 3- to 5-day post-treatment visits 24 weeks and 62 weeks after starting STS.\n\nVisits may include repeats of screening tests and:\n\n* Questionnaires\n* Scans: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may be injected with a radioactive agent.\n* Durometry: A small instrument applies pressure on the skin or exposed calcinosis.\n* Measurements of blood flow in the arms and fingernail blood vessels\n* Photographs of the skin\n* Kidney ultrasound\n* Tests of kidney function\n* Calcinosis aspiration: A needle placed into areas of calcinosis removes liquid.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Calcinosis Activity Visual Analogue Scale Score","timeFrame":"Week 10 minus week 0 (on therapy) and week 0 minus week -10 (baseline)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment","deltaMin":-3.45,"sd":0.89}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?B_2017-E-0161.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":14},"commonTop":["Flow cytometry","Venous oxygen saturation decreased","Venous oxygen saturation increased","Hypertension","Systolic hypertension"]}}
