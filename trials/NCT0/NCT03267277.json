Is taking any concomitant medications that are thought to alter sodium thiosulfate s effects or pharmacokinetics. Once patients have met all other inclusion criteria and no other exclusion criteria this criteria will be checked. A PharmD will evaluate the patient's current medication list for medications with the potential for interaction with sodium thiosulfate. Methodology is as follows: He or she will perform a search in two individual validated medication interaction software programs. He or she will also perform a literature search via PubMed for case reports of interactions with sodium thiosulfate. As an additional safeguard, the PharmD will evaluate the medication list utilizing principles of pharmacology and pharmacokinetics to attempt to identify any potential interactions not yet documented in the literature.\n19.

Weighs less than 26 kilograms.\\*\\*\n21. Has a regimen of pulse steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) that is at an interval besides every 1, 2, or 5 weeks.\n22.

Has had a severe complication of diabetes in the past year prior to enrollment.\n24. Anemia with a hemoglobin (HgB) less than 10 at time of screening or deemed to be too low to safely complete study by hematology consult team.\n25. We will attempt to enroll patients at a weight greater than 28 kg as these patients will be able to obtain all lab work for the study. Patients weighing 26 to 28 kg will only be able to obtain some of the research blood work. Patients less than 26 kg of body weight will be unable to obtain all safety labs, so will not be able to enroll.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"7 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Calcinosis Activity Visual Analogue Scale Score","description":"Calcinosis activity is defined by the metabolic activity and the inflammation associated with calcinosis. In evaluating calcinosis activity, the study physicians take into account the change in extent of calcinosis and the location of calcinosis lesions, the consistency and texture of calcinosis lesions, the presence of erythema surrounding calcinosis lesion, and any pain associated with the calcinosis lesions. A 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) was scored by a physician with a vertical line on the scale marking calcinosis activity where 0 cm indicates no evidence of calcinosis, and 10 cm mark indicates severe calcinosis activity. The change in calcinosis activity VAS score from week 0 to week 10 on therapy was compared to the change in calcinosis activity VAS score from week -10 to week 0 on baseline therapy. The baseline score was calculated by taking the week 0 score minus the week -10 score. The on therapy score was calculated by taking the week 10 score minus the week 0 score.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.45","spread":"0.89"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Quality of Life Measured by the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50): Physical Function Domain","description":"The Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50) is a 50-item survey with 14 domains that parents complete to assess their child's physical and mental well-being.
