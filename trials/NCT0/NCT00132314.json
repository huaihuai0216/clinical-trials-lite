Recruitment would take 27 months to complete, and the study would continue for a third year to allow 9 months of follow-up for the last patient recruited. All patients would be treated from the time of entry up to the end of the three-year study period. Follow-up assessments would continue quarterly. Treatments would not be blinded since giving placebo injections to the comparison group would interfere with the goal of comparing the acceptability of two different methods of medication administration. However, end points will be blindly rated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hospitalization-free Survival - Time to Event","timeFrame":"From randomization until date of first re-hospitalization, assessed up to 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Injectable Risperidone","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oral Antipsychotic","deltaMin":1.97,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.39"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21270143","21366475","21514794","22697193","23473656","23143523"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":96,"n":187},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Headache","Vomiting","Fatigue","Vertigo"]}}
