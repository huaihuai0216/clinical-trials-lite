Scarce information is available regarding the use of shoulder taping in preventing shoulder injuries in stroke patients. Aims:\n\nTo find out the effectiveness of taping technique with conventional treatment versus sham taping and conventional treatment in prevention of shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nTaping technique with conventional treatment will be superior to conventional treatment alone in preventing shoulder injuries in patients with acute stroke.\n\nMethods Research setting: Stroke unit, department of Neurology, Christian Medical College (CMC) Ludhiana, Punjab, India and College of Physiotherapy, CMC Ludhiana.\n\nStudy design: prospective, randomized, outcome blinded trial (PROBE design). Study period: Prospective for 18 months from May 2009 All stroke patients with upper limb weakness within 48 hours after the ictus and with Brunnstrom's stage of recovery 1 and 2 will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups using lottery method. The treatment arm group(Group I) include shoulder taping with conventional techniques that is(positioning, handling technique and passive range of motion exercises) and the control arm (Group II) include sham taping with conventional techniques with sham taping. A total of 80 patients in each group will be included. The plastic micropore and elastic adhesive tape will be used for taping the affected shoulder. The sham taping will be done using the same tapes but without stretching the concerned muscles and joints. The tapes will be changed every 3 days and will remain for 14 days. The outcome measures are as follows; Primary: Pain: Visual Analog Scale and Activities of daily living: Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI); Secondary: Range of motion: using a Goniometer. The outcome will be assessed by an independent physiotherapist who will be blinded to the clinical details. Patients will be followed-up at 14 days and 30 days. Statistical analyses will be done using SPSS software version 16.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain: Visual Analog Scale","timeFrame":"14 days and 30 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Taping","deltaMin":-2.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sham Taping","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.03"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23345636"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":65},"commonTop":[]}}
