The primary objective is to evaluate the initial response to GSK1278863 measured by hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in HD patients not using ESAs enrolled in this study. The study is designed to evaluate the appropriateness of the starting dose of GSK1278863 and of the GSK1278863 dose adjustment regimen to achieve or maintain the target Hgb levels. This study will consist of a 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period (4-week fixed-dose period and a 20-week dose adjustment period), and a 2- to 4-week follow-up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hgb at Week 4","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All Participants","deltaMin":0.79,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31306555"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":28},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Infected dermal cyst","Shunt stenosis"]}}
