Participants in the platinum-based chemotherapy arms with non-squamous tumor histologies may receive pemetrexed maintenance therapy after the 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival (OS) compared to SOC chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With a Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50%","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 44 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy (SOC Treatment)","deltaMin":12.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["36306479","35073727","33231285","31610828","30955977"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":261,"n":636},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Nausea","Decreased appetite","Fatigue","Constipation"]}}
