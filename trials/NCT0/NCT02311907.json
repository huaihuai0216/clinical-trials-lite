Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoprotective drugs, such as glutathione, may help prevent peripheral neuropathy caused by paclitaxel and carboplatin. It is not yet known whether glutathione is more effective than a placebo in preventing peripheral neuropathy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Paclitaxel/Carboplatin (PC) Induced Peripheral Neuropathy as Assessed by EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), Quality of Life (QLQ), Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy 20 (CIPN20)).","timeFrame":"Every 28 day cycle, up to 6 cycles.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A (Glutathione, Carboplatin)","deltaMin":83.7,"sd":0.89},{"arm":"B (Placebo, Paclitaxel)","deltaMin":82.1,"sd":0.93}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.21"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":390,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":94},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Anemia","Fatigue","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","White blood cell decreased"]}}
