Patients will receive either CR845 or placebo after each dialysis session for eight weeks. The safety and efficacy of CR845 will be monitored throughout the study. A sub-group of patients will also have pharmacokinetic assessments completed. Part B of the study will assess one dose of IVCR845 versus placebo for 12 weeks in patients on hemodialysis who have moderate-to-severe itching. The dose of CR845 used in Part B will be based on safety and efficacy found in Part A.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Weekly Mean of the Daily 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS Score During Week 8","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CR845 0.5mcg/kg","deltaMin":-3.8,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"CR845 1 mcg/kg","deltaMin":-2.8,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"CR845 1.5mcg/kg","deltaMin":-3.2,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":0.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.107"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.019"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33283264"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":44},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Dizziness","Somnolence","Nausea","Fall"]}}
