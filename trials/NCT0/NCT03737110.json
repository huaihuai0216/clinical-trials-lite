Lower scores are considered good, better, or healthy, and increasingly higher scores are considered to indicate greater insomnia.\n\nClinical interpretation of the total score is as follows:\n\n0 to 7 = no clinically significant insomnia; 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia; 15 to 21 = clinical insomnia (moderate severity); 22 to 28 = clinical insomnia (severe).","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Were Off Background Pericarditis Medication on or Before RI Period Weeks 4, 8, 10, and 12","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"79","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"69","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"49","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"71","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Annualized Rate of Pericarditis Recurrence in the Long-Term Extension (LTE) Period Based on Investigator's Assessment (Based on Investigators' Judgement)","description":"Annualized Recurrence Rate is defined as the number of recurrences in LTE periods for all participants/Sum of participant years in LTE periods for all participants.
