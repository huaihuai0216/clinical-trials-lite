Preexisting clinically significant disease or chronic condition that can be ascertained at the time of admission and could affect functional outcome\n10. Severe cardiac or hemodynamic instability prior to randomization\n11. Known treatment with another investigational drug therapy or procedure within 30 days of injury\n12. A history of allergic reaction to progesterone and related drugs or any of the components of the infusion\n13. Any disease, in the opinion of the Investigator, that is unstable or which could jeopardize the safety of the patient and his/her compliance in the study.\n14.

A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment. The 8 scales can also be further summarized to provide a summary score for physical health and a summary score for mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"39.8","spread":"12.16"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.6","spread":"11.37"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"44.6","spread":"11.50"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45.1","spread":"11.30"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48.7","spread":"12.71"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48.5","spread":"12.72"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"47.9","spread":"11.24"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"46.8","spread":"12.36"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Potentially Clinically Important On-Treatment Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) and Summary of Maximum Therapy Therapeutic Intensity Level (TIL)","description":"Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) levels are presented according to clinically significant cut-off values.
