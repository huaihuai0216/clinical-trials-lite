The purpose of the study is to determine if treatment with 4 tablets, 500 milligrams each, of valacyclovir given 3 times daily by mouth for 90 days is both effective and safe after completing intravenous acyclovir treatment and if it can increase survival with or without mild impairment of the brain and mental functions. Participants will be assigned to either drug or placebo (inactive substance) randomly (by chance). Study procedures will include blood samples and lumbar punctures (procedure in which a needle is inserted into the lower back to collect cerebral spinal fluid). Subjects will participate for up to 24 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Survival With no or Mild Neuropsychological Impairment at 12 Months After Initiation of Study Medication as Measured by the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS)","timeFrame":"One year post therapy.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Valacyclovir","deltaMin":28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":34,"sd":null},{"arm":"Total","deltaMin":62,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States","Canada","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25956891"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":40},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Depression","Fatigue","Urinary tract infection"]}}
