The main aim of the second extension study is to explore the bactericidal antibody persistence in 4-year-old children after a fourth dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ or after a two-dose catch-up schedule of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to toddlers as part of their respective vaccination courses in study V72P12E1.\n\nIn addition, this study will characterize the antibody response to a fifth dose boost in all children who received a three-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 3, 4 months of age (in parent study V72P12, NCT00721396), and only in a subset of children who received a three-dose primary series of rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 4, 6 months of age (in parent study V72P12). Antibody response will also be characterized to a third dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered at approximately 4 years of age in all children who received a two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ as toddlers in study V72P12E1.\n\nFinally, the safety and immunogenicity of two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 2 months apart to healthy naïve children at 4 years of age will be assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentages of Subjects With Persisting Serum Bactericidal Titers ≥1:5 and ≥1:8 (at 4 Years of Age), Who Had Previously Received Three Primary Doses and One Booster Dose of rMenB+OMV NZ Vaccine According to Different Schedules","timeFrame":"Day 1 (24-36 months post booster; baseline for naive)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"B+R246_12_48","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R246_18_48","deltaMin":18,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R246_24_48","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"B246_12_48","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"B246_18_48","deltaMin":27,"sd":null},{"arm":"B246_24_48","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R234_12_48","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R234_18_48","deltaMin":25,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R234_24_48","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"B48 50","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"48 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["Czechia","Italy","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29038320"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":["INJECTION SITE PAIN","INJECTION SITE ERYTHEMA","INJECTION SITE INDURATION","IRRITABILITY","SOMNOLENCE"]}}
