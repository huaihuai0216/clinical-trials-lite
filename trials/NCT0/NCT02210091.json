A one-stage clotting assay was used as the primary assay and a chromogenic assay was used to provide supportive data.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8563","spread":"0.76004"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.8696","spread":"0.25856"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.8636","spread":"0.53481"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.7374","spread":"0.29110"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0458","spread":"0.31739"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.9065","spread":"0.33879"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8809","spread":"0.48894"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.9342","spread":"0.47451"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.9101","spread":"0.47371"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8813","spread":"0.27069"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.1710","spread":"0.38472"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.0402","spread":"0.36355"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Pharmacokinetics (PK): Incremental Recovery (IR) of BAX 855 Over Time - One Stage Clotting Assay","description":"Pre- and post-infusion levels of Factor VIII (FVIII) following infusion of BAX 855 were used to determine IR.
