For the time-to-failure analysis, time was defined as the number of days since the second visit where clinical resolution of initial BV was confirmed. The non-parametric maximum likelihood estimate (NPMLE) of the survival curve was estimated using the interval package in R to account for the interval censored data. Results are presented using an Amsel criteria score of as well as for BV diagnosis. All analyses were conducted using R 4.2.2 (R Core Team, 2020) in RStudio (RStudio Team 2021).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7051","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Number of Subjects That Failed Treatment in the Supressive Phase","description":"The probability of recurrence or treatment failure was calculated as time from the second visit in days.
