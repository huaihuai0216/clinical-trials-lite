The maximum dose will be 600mg/day. Subjects may participate in this trial until October 2007. This time may be extended to allow them to participate until lacosamide is commercially available.\n\nIf a subject meet the requirements for the study at Visit 1 and after a two weeks phase without trial medication, s/he enters a Titration Phase to determine the personal optimal dose of lacosamide. When this dose is reached s/he will enter the Maintenance Phase and will be asked to return for visits every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Adverse Events (AE) Reported Spontaneously by the Subject or Observed by the Investigator","timeFrame":"From Screening until Safety Follow up Visit (up to 140 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lacosamide","deltaMin":80.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.metadatecd.com/prescribing-information.aspx"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":83,"n":371},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Nausea","Vertigo","Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
