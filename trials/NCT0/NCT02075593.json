Continuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is key to both mother and the unborn fetus in order to maintain virologic suppression in the mother (thereby decreasing the risk for maternal disease progression), but also to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to her unborn child. This study also offers the first opportunity to investigate the impact of pregnancy on DTG pharmacokinetics (PK). This is an open-label, single arm interventional study. The number of women that will be enrolled into this study cannot be established a priori, as unintended pregnancies cannot be determined in advance. The maximum number of women would include all of those women randomized to DTG/ABC/3TC FDC (approximately 237), though unintended pregnancies in all of these women would not be anticipated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time Curve at Steady State During a Dosing Interval (AUC [0-tau]) for Dolutegravir","timeFrame":"Pre-dose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hours post-dose at Trimester 2 (Weeks 18-26 of pregnancy), Trimester 3 (Weeks 30-36 of pregnancy) and at 8-12 Weeks postpartum","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG/ABC/3TC - Mother","deltaMin":55.045,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":4},"commonTop":["Respiratory tract infection","Asthenia","Headache","Nephropathy","Cystitis"]}}
