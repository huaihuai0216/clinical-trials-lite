must provide written informed consent, with Subject assent where appropriate, prior to the Subject's participation in the Study.\n* Be less than 17 years of age and older than 37 weeks post conception\n* Anticipated by the Investigator to require multi-day (minimum of one day) use of intravenous (IV) treatment either because of a having a status of nothing by mouth (NPO) or a medical condition that makes oral intake difficult or be willing to undergo at least 5 days of treatment with IV acetaminophen for the treatment of pain or fever\n* Have the ability to read and understand the Study procedures and have the ability to communicate meaningfully with the Study Investigator and staff (if the Subject is of preverbal age or cannot read or communicate meaningfully, then the Subject's Parent or Guardian must meet this criterion)\n* If a female of child bearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has significant medical disease(s), laboratory abnormalities or condition(s) that in the Investigator's judgment could compromise the Subject's welfare, ability to communicate with the Study staff, complete Study activities, or would otherwise contraindicate Study participation\n* Has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to receiving IV acetaminophen or the inactive ingredients (excipients) of IV acetaminophen\n* Has impaired liver function, e.g. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin greater than or equal to 3 times ULN, known active hepatic disease (e.g., hepatitis), evidence of clinically significant chronic liver disease or other condition affecting the liver (e.g., alcoholism as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), cirrhosis, or chronic hepatitis) that may suggest the potential for an increased susceptibility to hepatic toxicity with IV acetaminophen exposure\n* Has participated in an interventional clinical Study (investigational or marketed product) within 30 days of Study entry","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"37 Weeks","maximumAge":"16
