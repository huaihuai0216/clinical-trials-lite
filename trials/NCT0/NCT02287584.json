An anchored Likert scale from 1 - 7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then summed to determine scores for the 3 subscales, as well as a total score. The PANSS total score is the sum of all 30 items and ranges from 30 through 210.
