In the case of Simple Partial Seizures, only those with motor signs will be counted towards meeting the inclusion criterion\n* Subjects must be on a stable dose regimen of at least 1, but no more than 3 AEDs (concurrent stable Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is not counted as an AED). The VNS must have been in place for at least 6 months prior to study entry. The dosage of concomitant AED therapy and the settings of the VNS must be kept constant for a period of at least 4 weeks prior to entry into the Baseline Period\n* Minimum Body Weight of 40 kg\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject has a lifetime history of suicide attempt (including an active attempt, interrupted attempt, or aborted attempt) or has a suicidal ideation in the past 6 months as indicated by a positive response (\"Yes\") to either Question 4 or Question 5 of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Screening\n* Subject has a current or previous diagnosis of Pseudo-Seizures, Conversion Disorders, or other non-epileptical events that could be confused with Seizures\n* Subject has Seizures that are uncountable due to Clustering (ie, an episode lasting less than 30 minutes in which several Seizures occur with such frequency that the initiation and completion of each individual Seizure cannot be distinguished) during the 8-Week Period prior to Visit 1\n* Subject has a history of Primary Generalized Seizures\n* Subject with a history of Status Epilepticus within the 12-Months Period prior to Visit 1\n* Subject who underwent surgery for Epilepsy within the 2 Years Period prior to Visit 1\n* Subjects with cardiac, renal, hepatic, endocrinological dysfunction or psychiatric illness that may impair reliable participation in the study or necessitate the use of medication not allowed by the protocol","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Partial-Onset Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days From Baseline to the Maintenance Period","description":"Partial-onset seizure (POS) frequency per 28 days was calculated as:\n\nPOS frequency = (Number of POS over the specified time interval) / (Number of days in the interval with available diary data) x 28.\n\nA negative value in Change in Partial-onset seizure frequency indicates a reduction of Partial-onset seizure frequency from Baseline to the Maintenance Period.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.33","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.50","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"The Proportion of Individual Patients Who Experience a 50 % or Greater Reduction in Seizure Frequency From Baseline to the Maintenance Period (50 % Responder Rate)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"70","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"88","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent Change in Partial-Onset Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days From Baseline to the Maintenance Period","description":"Calculates as 28-day seizure frequency during the Maintenance Period - 28-day seizure frequency during the Baseline Period, divided by the 28-day seizure frequency during the Baseline Period with this quantity multiplied by 100.
