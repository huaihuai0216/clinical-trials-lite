Exceptions: Subjects with a history of lymphoproliferative disorder at any time in their life will be excluded, while subjects with a history of localized nonmelanotic skin cancer that has been completely removed during the past 5 years may be eligible.\n* Long-term use of oral steroids, parenteral steroids, or high-dose inhaled steroids (\\>800 mcg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within the preceding 6 months (Nasal and topical steroids are allowed).\n* Diagnosis of or treatment for bipolar disorder, severe major depression, schizophrenia or other major psychotic disorder in the past 3 months that is associated with severely impaired judgment or cognition.\n* History of receiving immunoglobulin or other blood product within the 3 months prior to enrollment in this study.\n* Receipt of any other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study.\n* Use of experimental vaccines or any influenza vaccine other than FluBlOk after May 31st 2007 for the 2008 Southern Hemisphere or 2007 to 2008 Northern hemisphere epidemic seasons.\n* History of severe reactions following immunization with influenza virus vaccines.\n* Moderate to severe acute illness or febrile illness (oral temperature greater than 100degreesF) within 1 week prior to vaccination.\n* Receipt of an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product or medication) within 1 month prior to enrollment in this study, or expects to receive an experimental agent during study period.\n* Known active human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.\n* History of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 5 years.\n* History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome.\n* Subject is not available for three (3) or more consecutive weeks during active influenza season.\n* Any acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, interfere with the evaluation of responses, or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. These conditions include, but are not limited to: history of significant renal impairment (dialysis and treatment for kidney disease, including diabetic and hypertensive kidney disease); subjects with diabetes mellitus, well-controlled with oral agents may enroll as long there has been no dosage increase within the past 6 months; insulin-dependent diabetes is excluded; cardiac insufficiency, if heart failure is present (New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV); an arteriosclerotic event during the 6 months prior to enrollment (e.g., history of myocardial infarction, stroke, recanalization of femoral arteries, or transient ischemic attack)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","maximumAge":"64 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Evaluation and Comparison of Immunogenicity of FluBlok and TIV in Healthy Adults 50-64 Years of Age.","description":"Immunogenicity was assessed by measuring the difference in values in Hemagglutination-Inhibition Assay (HAI) titers in participants from Day 0 to Day 28, using Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs).
