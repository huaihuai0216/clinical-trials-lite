Headache attacks lasting at least 2 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)\n\nC. Headache has at least two of the following four characteristics:\n\n* unilateral location\n* pulsating quality\n* moderate or severe pain intensity\n* aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (eg, walking or climbing stairs)\n\nD. Also has least one of the following:\n\n* nausea and/or vomiting\n* photophobia and phonophobia\n\nE. Not better accounted for by another diagnosis in the opinion of the treating physician\n\nCriterion A (at least 5 attacks) is not being used in this study because prior research has shown that removing criterion A increases the sensitivity of these criteria in the ED. The patient and their caregiver will also be required to understand spoken and written English. In addition, potential participants will be required to have an upper arm circumference of at least 20 cm to ensure optimal device fit and safety.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nExclusion criteria include the following: allergy or contraindication to metoclopramide, ketorolac, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories; implanted electrical device, congestive heart failure, severe cardiac or cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled epilepsy (2 or more unprovoked seizures per year), abnormal skin on both upper arms (e.g., cancerous lesion on both upper arms, metallic implants on both upper arms, or abnormal physical sensation in both upper arms), febrile at triage, head trauma in the past 7 days, current secondary headache, previously enrolled in the study, pregnant or lactating.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"8 Years","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Assessment of Recruitment Rate","description":"The primary outcome for this pilot study involves assessment of the feasibility of using the REN device to treat children and adolescents suffering from acute migraine attacks in the ED. The primary feasibility outcome will be determined based on the recruitment rate, defined as the number of participants enrolled per month. Our target is to have an average recruitment rate of 1.5 participants per month. Feasibility will be used as the primary outcome, along with the secondary outcomes, to provide preliminary data to help design and optimize a fully powered, phase III RCT.\n\nRecruitment rate for both phases of the study are reported to understand if changing to crossover design improved recruitment. We switched to a crossover design strictly to address participant and recruitment concerns around not receiving standard of care migraine treatment if initially randomized to receive REN treatment and such treatment was unsuccessful.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.1","spread":"1.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":"1.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Reduction in Pain Severity","description":"Reduction in pain severity between baseline and 1-hour, 2 hours, and 48 hours post-interventions.
