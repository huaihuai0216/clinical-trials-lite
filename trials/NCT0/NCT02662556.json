Male or female patients who are 40 years of age or older.\n2. Patients who have undergone a surgical procedure with general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia that does not include intrathecal opioids during the operation.\n3. Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class IIII (Appendix I).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who have taken an opioid for more than 30 consecutive days, at a daily dose of more than 15 mg of morphine (or equivalent), within the past 3 months prior to surgery (e.g. more than 3 doses per day of Vicodin®, Norco®, Lortab® with 5 mg hydrocodone per tablet).\n2. Patients with a positive drug of abuse screen unless the positive test result is consistent with a prescribed medication.\n3. Patients with a history of opioid dependence within 2 years before the start of the study, defined as meeting the DSM-IV-TR™ Criteria for Substance Dependence specified in Appendix II.\n4. Patients who have used any illicit drugs of abuse within five years before the start of the study.\n5. Patients who have abused any prescription medication or alcohol within one year before the start of the study.\n6. Patients with an allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids.\n7. Patients who are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or have taken MAOIs within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n8. Patients with current sleep apnea that has been documented by a sleep laboratory study or are on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time-weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) Over the 12-hour Study Period (SPID12).","description":"The pain intensity difference (PID) at each evaluation time point after the dose of study drug is the difference in pain intensity at the specific evaluation time point and baseline pain intensity \\[PID(evaluation time after the first dose) = PI(baseline) - PI(evaluation time after the first dose)\\].
