Subjects were to have completed Study CLAR-09007.\n2. Subjects were to have adequate venous access in the left or right arm to allow collection of a number of blood samples via a venous cannula.\n3. Subjects were required to remain off all forms of T except for study medication throughout the entire study.\n4. Subjects voluntarily gave written informed consent to participate in this study.\n\nSubjects meeting any of the following criteria were not eligible for participation in this study:\n\n1. Significant intercurrent disease of any type, in particular liver, kidney, uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart disease, or psychiatric illness developed during the Phase III study that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, require exclusion from this study.\n2. Untreated, severe obstructive sleep apnea (diagnosed during previous Phase III study).\n3. Serum transaminases \\>2 times upper limit of normal (ULN), serum bilirubin \\>2.0 mg/dL and serum creatinine \\>2.0 mg/dL at the final visit for Study CLAR 09007.\n4. Abnormal prostate digital rectal examination (palpable nodule\\[s\\]) or elevated PSA (serum PSA \\>4 ng/mL) at the final visit for Study CLAR-09007.\n5. Use of dietary supplement saw palmetto or phytoestrogens and use of any dietary supplements that may increase serum T, such as androstenedione or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).\n6. Known malabsorption syndrome and/or current treatment with oral lipase inhibitors (e.g., orlistat \\[Xenical\\]) and bile acid-binding resins (e.g., cholestyramine \\[Questran\\], colestipol \\[Colestid\\]).\n7. Poor compliers with study medication, study procedures, or study visits in Study CLAR 09007.\n8. Concomitant use of antiandrogens, estrogens, potent oral CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., barbiturates, glucocorticoids \\[pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids for replacement therapy were not exclusionary\\]) and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\] antivirals \\[indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, delaviridine\\], amiodarone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ketoconazole). (Note: Short-term ciprofloxacin administration completed more than 7 days prior to study visits was not exclusionary during the study.)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change From Baseline in T Cholesterol","description":"Long-term safety profile of oral TU product compared with AndroGel based on absolute change from primary baseline based on Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit and prostate volume.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change From Baseline in HDL","description":"Long-term safety profile of oral TU product compared with AndroGel based on absolute change from primary baseline based on Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit and prostate volume.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change From Baseline in LDL","description":"Long-term safety profile of oral TU product compared with AndroGel based on absolute change from primary baseline based on Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit and prostate volume.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change From Baseline in Hgb","description":"Long-term safety profile of oral TU product compared with AndroGel based on absolute change from primary baseline based on Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit and prostate volume.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.36","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.36","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change From Baseline in Hct","description":"Long-term safety profile of oral TU product compared with AndroGel based on absolute change from primary baseline based on Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit and prostate volume.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.37","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change From Baseline in Prostate Volume","description":"Long-term safety profile of oral TU product compared with AndroGel based on absolute change from primary baseline based on Total Cholesterol, HDL, LDL, hemoglobin, hematocrit and prostate volume.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.09","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":88},"commonTop":["Polycythemia","Bronchitis","Hematocrit Increased","Rash","Hypertension"]}}}
