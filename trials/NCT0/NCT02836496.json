In conditions where eosinophilia is considered to play an important part in the pathology, including eosinophilic asthma, HES, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, a consistent reduction in blood eosinophil counts is observed in association with mepolizumab administration, with concomitant clinical improvement. This is a 32-week treatment period, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre study of mepolizumab in adolescent and adult subjects with severe HES receiving standard of care (SoC) therapy. This study will demonstrate the efficacy of mepolizumab compared with placebo based on maintenance of control of HES symptoms during the treatment period. The study will comprise of a screening period of up to approximately 4 weeks followed by a 32-Week study treatment period (subjects will be randomized 1:1 to placebo or mepolizumab) and up to 8-week additional follow-up period (12 weeks after the last dose of study treatment).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Experienced an HES Flare or Who Withdrew From the Study During the 32-Week Study Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Up to Week 32","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mepolizumab 300 mg SC","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.002"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":43,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Russia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37064032","36091012","35568330","35493455","34389506","32956756"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":54},"commonTop":["Bronchitis","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Diarrhoea","Rhinitis"]}}
