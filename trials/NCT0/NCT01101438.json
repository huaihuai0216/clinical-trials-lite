Health Canada has not approved the sale or use of Metformin to treat breast cancer, although they have approved its use in this clinical trial. Although Metformin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of diabetes, its use in breast cancer is considered investigational.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Invasive Disease-free Survival in Hormone Receptor (ER and PgR) Positive Sub-groups","timeFrame":"5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin","deltaMin":86.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":85.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.93"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":344,"countries":["United States","Canada","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25740979","35608580","37695982"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":1816},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Hot flashes","Diarrhea","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Nausea"]}}
