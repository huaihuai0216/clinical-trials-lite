The study will also evaluate secondary outcomes, including: post-operative pain rating, length of hospital stay, postoperative antiemetic use, bladder catheterization at discharge, number of post-operative phone calls, and rate of reported side effects of opioid use (nausea/constipation). Study participants will be asked to utilize the validated Brief Pain Inventory (appendix A) scale to assess post-operative pain levels. Based on inpatient post-operative opioid use and number of opioid pills prescribed at discharge, an attempt will be made to develop an algorithm for recommended opioid prescribing patterns.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Morphine Milligram Equivalents Used During Inpatient Stay","timeFrame":"from immediately postoperative through discharge or 4 weeks, whichever comes first","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control Arm","deltaMin":10.8,"sd":5.6},{"arm":"Treatment Arm","deltaMin":8.8,"sd":7.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28551445"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":[]}}
