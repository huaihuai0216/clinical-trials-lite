It is composed of 24 items that are grouped into three dimensions, including pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and function (17 items). The response can be in a form of visual analog or five-point Likert scale \\[11, 23\\]. In this study, the response is on a 10-cm horizontal line with numeric description from 0 to 10. The score of each dimension is an average of the component item scores. The WOMAC total score is determined by averaging the scores of all dimensions. The total score ranges from 0 (best outcome possible) to 10 (worst outcome possible).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.71","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.65","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Gait Speed (Calculated From the Time Spending for 100-meter Walk)","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Global Improvement","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Patient's Satisfaction to the Treatment","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Adverse Events","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["pain","flushing","swelling"]}}}
