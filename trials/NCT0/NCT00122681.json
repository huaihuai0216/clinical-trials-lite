Administration of some routine vaccines up to 8 days before each dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window.\n* Previous vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV).\n* History of vaccination against Hepatitis A or a known clinical history of Hepatitis A disease.\n* History of having had colposcopy or has planned a colposcopy to evaluate an abnormal cervical cytology (Pap smear) test.\n* Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of allergic disease, suspected allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccines.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* Known acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by previous physical examination or laboratory tests.\n* History of chronic condition(s) requiring treatment.\n* Received immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 90 days preceding enrollment.
