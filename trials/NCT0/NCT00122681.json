Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This study will evaluate the efficacy of GSK Biologicals HPV 16/18 VLP/AS04 vaccine to prevent infection associated cervical pre-cancer and vaccine with HPV 16 or 18 and the vaccine safety, over 48 months, in young adolescents and women of 15/25 years of age at study start. Approximately 18.000 study subjects will either receive the HPV vaccine or a control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine) administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule.\n\nThe Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Histopathologically-confirmed Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)2+ Associated With HPV-16 and/or -18 Cervical Infection in Subjects HPV DNA Negative and Seronegative at Baseline or Overall (Any Serostatus at Baseline)","timeFrame":"Up to the moment when 36 cases of CIN2+ lesions associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection had been detected, including at least 15 cases of CIN2+ associated with HPV-18 infection.
