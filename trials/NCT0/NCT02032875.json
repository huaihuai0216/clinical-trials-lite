All subjects were treated with daclatasvir+sofosbuvir+ribavirin and were followed for 24 weeks post treatment. Under certain conditions, the treatment duration could have been extended for cirrhotic participants. The study tested the efficacy and safety of this combination for treatment of HCV in cirrhotic and post transplant patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of HCV Genotype-1 Infected Post-liver Transplanted Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at Post-treatment Week 12 (SVR12)","timeFrame":"Post-treatment follow-up Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Post-liver Transplant Cohort: Daclatasvir+Sofosbuvir+Ribavirin","deltaMin":95.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.bms.com/studyconnect/Pages/home.aspx","http://www.bms.com/clinical_trials/Pages/Investigator_Inquiry_form.aspx"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":53},"commonTop":["Headache","Fatigue","Anaemia","Diarrhoea","Nausea"]}}
