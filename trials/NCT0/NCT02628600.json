After assessments were performed for heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO2), dyspnea, and overall fatigue using the Borg scale, participants were instructed to walk on a prescribed course as far as they could in 6 minutes. Pre-test assessment parameters were repeated after exertion. The maximum distance achieved and post exertion heart rate and SpO2 were compared to pre-test values. The maximum distance achieved was recorded in the electronic case report form.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"435.9","spread":"132.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"449.0","spread":"122.64"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.4","spread":"69.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-20.8","spread":"51.57"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.1","spread":"79.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-42.2","spread":"72.66"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":73},"commonTop":["Dysphonia","Cough","Dyspnoea","Haemoptysis","Nasopharyngitis"]}}}
