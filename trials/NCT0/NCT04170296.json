A Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (CSS) Subsection D \"Grade of Laxity, Flaccidity, or Sagging Skin\" score of 0 (absence of laxity, flaccidity, or sagging skin), or 1 (slightly draped appearance) at the Screening Visit only.\n2. Be willing to apply sunscreen to the treatment areas before each exposure to the sun for the duration of the study.\n3. Be judged to be in good health.\n4. Have a negative pregnancy test.\n5. Be willing and able to cooperate with the requirements of the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Is from a vulnerable population, as defined by the United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 45, Part 46, Section 46.111(b) and other local and national regulations, including but not limited to, employees (temporary, part-time, full-time, etc.) or a family member of the research staff conducting the study, or of the sponsor, or of the contract research organization, or of the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).\n2. Has a history of sensitivity or allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of CCH.\n3. Has systemic conditions (coagulation disorders, malignancy, keloidal scarring, abnormal wound healing) that restricts study participation.\n4. Has local (in areas to be treated) conditions (thrombosis, vascular disorder, active infection/inflammation, active cutaneous alteration, tattoo/mole) that restricts study participation.\n5. Has skin laxity or linear undulations on the treatment region (both buttocks or both thighs) that can be effaced by lifting skin.\n6. Has a Hexsel CSS Subsection D \"Grade of laxity, flaccidity, or sagging skin\" of 2 (moderate draped appearance) or 3 (severe draped appearance).\n7. Requires anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication during the study.\n8. Has used or intends to use any of the local applications/therapies/injections/procedures that restricts study participation.\n9. Has received any collagenase treatments at any time prior to treatment in this study and/or has received previous treatment with EN3835 or CCH for cellulite.\n10. Has received treatment with an investigational product within 30 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) of the Screening Visit.\n11. Is pregnant and/or is providing breast milk in any manner, or plans to become pregnant and/or to provide breast milk during the course of the study.\n12. Has any other condition(s) that, in the investigator's opinion, might indicate the subject to be unsuitable for the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","genderBased":true,"minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Proportion of Participants With Improved (+1 or Better) Score on I-GAIS for Either Posterolateral Thigh","description":"Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I-GAIS) is a 7-point scale rating global aesthetic improvement in appearance, compared to pretreatment, as judged by the investigator.
