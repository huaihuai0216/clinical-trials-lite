the local pathology department policy regarding release of tumor samples must be considered in the screening process; patients whose tumor samples are located in a pathology department that by policy will not submit any samples for research purposes should not be approached for participation in the B-52 trial\n* The patient must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines\n* The patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* Clinical staging for the primary tumor can be cT1c (must be 2.0 cm) or T2-T4 if clinically node negative; if the regional lymph nodes are cN1 and cytologically or histologically positive or if cN2-N3 with or without a biopsy, the primary breast tumor can be cT0-T4\n* The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy\n* Ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes must be evaluated by imaging (mammogram, ultrasound, and/or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\]) within 6 weeks prior to randomization; if suspicious or abnormal, fine needle aspirate (FNA) or core biopsy is recommended, also within 6 weeks prior to randomization; findings of these evaluations will be used to determine the nodal status prior to randomization:\n\n  * Nodal status - negative\n\n    * Imaging of the axilla is negative\n    * Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but the FNA or core biopsy of the questionable node(s) on imaging is negative\n  * Nodal status - positive\n\n    * FNA or core biopsy of the node(s) is cytologically or histologically suspicious or positive\n    * Imaging is suspicious or abnormal but FNA or core biopsy was not performed\n* Patients may be premenopausal or postmenopausal at the time of randomization; for study purposes, postmenopausal is defined as:\n\n  * Age 56 or older with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months prior to study entry; or\n  * Age 55 or younger with no spontaneous menses for at least 12 months prior to study entry (e.g., spontaneous or secondary to hysterectomy) and with a documented estradiol level in the postmenopausal range according to local institutional/laboratory standard; or\n  * Documented bilateral oophorectomy\n* The tumor must have been determined to be HER2-postive as follows:\n\n  * Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or\n  * In situ hybridization (ISH)-positive (defined by ratio of HER2 to circulating endothelial progenitors \\[CEP\\]17 \\>= 2.0 or HER2 gene copy number \\>= 6 per nucleus)\n* The tumor must have been determined to be estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone (PgR) positive assessed by current American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologist (CAP) guideline recommendations for hormone receptor testing; patients with \\>= 1% ER or PgR staining by IHC are considered positive\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be \\>= 1200/mm\\^3\n* Platelet count must be \\>= 100,000/mm\\^3\n* Hemoglobin must be \\>= 10 g/dL\n* Total bilirubin must be =\\< upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation \\> ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin\n* Alkaline phosphatase must be =\\< 2.5 x ULN for the lab\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be =\\< 1.5 x ULN for the lab\n* Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be \\> the ULN; for example, if the alkaline phosphatase is \\> the ULN but =\\< 2.5 x ULN, the AST must be =\\< the ULN; if the AST is \\> the ULN but =\\< 1.5 x ULN, the alkaline phosphatase must be =\\< ULN; Note: If alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is performed instead of AST (per institution's standard practice), the ALT value must be =\\< 1.5 x ULN; if both were performed, the AST must be =\\< 1.5 x ULN\n* Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase \\> ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (computed tomography \\[CT\\], MRI, positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]-CT, or PET scan) performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements are met\n* Patients with alkaline phosphatase that is \\> ULN but =\\< 2.5 x ULN or unexplained bone pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan performed within 6 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease\n* Within 6 weeks prior to randomization, the most recent serum creatinine must be =\\< ULN or measured or calculated creatinine clearance must be \\> 60 mL/min\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment must be performed within 90 days prior to randomization; (LVEF assessment performed by 2-dimensional \\[2-D\\] echocardiogram is preferred; however, multi gated acquisition scan \\[MUGA\\] scan may be substituted based on institutional preferences); the LVEF must be \\>= 50% regardless of the cardiac imaging facility's lower limit of normal; note: since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment; if the baseline LVEF is \\> 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and repeat the test if the accuracy is uncertain\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* FNA alone to diagnose the breast cancer\n* Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to randomization\n* Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to randomization;
