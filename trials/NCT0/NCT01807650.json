Also the participant needed to agree to return to site for 3 and 12 months follow-up visits.\n* Women of childbearing potential who were in the period between menarche and menopause needed to apply a highly effective method of birth control (failure rate less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine contraceptive devices \\[IUDs\\], sexual abstinence, or a vasectomized partner). Birth control method needed to have been applied for at least 1 monthly cycle prior to first administration of study drug, be maintained during the study treatment phase and continued for at least 30 days after the last administration of study drug. Sexually active, non-vasectomized men needed to use a barrier method (condoms) during the treatment phase of this clinical trial.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diseases or conditions that could, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with the assessment of safety or efficacy.\n* A skin disorder that was chronic or currently active and which the Investigator considered would adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or involved the areas to be examined in this trial.\n* A history of clinically significant hypersensitivity to any of the drugs, surgical dressings or excipients to be used in this trial.\n* Known multiple allergic disorders.\n* Taking, or have taken, any investigational drugs within 3 months prior to the screening visit.\n* Pregnant or breast feeding women were not allowed to participate in the study.\n* Inappropriate to participate in the study, for any reason, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Mental incapacity or language barriers precluding adequate understanding the ICF or co-operation or willingness to follow study procedures.\n* Previous participation in this study.\n* Employee at the investigational site, relative or spouse of the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Intra-individual Difference in Time to Wound Closure","description":"Intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between wound halves, either treated with Oleogel-S10 and non-adhesive wound dressing or treated with non-adhesive wound dressing only.
