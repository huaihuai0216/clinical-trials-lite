The purpose of this study is to find out whether starting to take a medicine called empagliflozin soon after first being treated in hospital helps people with acute heart failure.\n\nParticipants are in the study for about 3 months. At the beginning, participants are still in hospital. Later, they visit the hospital about 3 times and get 1 phone call. Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group takes 1 empagliflozin tablet a day. The other group takes\n\n1 placebo tablet a day. Placebo tablets look like empagliflozin tablets but do not contain any medicine. Empagliflozin belongs to a class of medicines known as SGLT-2 inhibitors. It is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nDuring the study, the doctors check whether participants have additional heart failure events like needing to go to the hospital again because of heart failure. The participants answer questions about how their heart failure affects their life. We then compare the results between the empagliflozin and placebo groups. The doctors also regularly check the general health of the participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Pairwise Comparisons With Wins of Clinical Benefit, a Composite of Death, Number of Heart Failure Events (HFEs), Time to the First HFE and â‰¥5-point Difference in CfB in KCCQ-TSS After 90 Days of Treatment","timeFrame":"Up to 90 days.
