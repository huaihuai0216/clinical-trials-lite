This can lead to several serious problems, including reduced blood flow throughout the body, congestion of blood in the veins and lungs, and fluid accumulation in various organs and limbs. Diuretics are often used to address the problem of fluid accumulation, but the optimal dose and the amount of time over which to administer each dose are unclear. This study will compare high and low doses of diuretics administered over longer and shorter periods of time to determine the safest and most effective combination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patient Well Being, as Determined by a Visual Analog Scale","timeFrame":"Measured at 72 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Q 12 Hour Bolus","deltaMin":4236,"sd":1440.4},{"arm":"Continuous Infusion","deltaMin":4372.7,"sd":1404.4},{"arm":"Low Intensification","deltaMin":4170.8,"sd":1436.3},{"arm":"High Intensification","deltaMin":4429.6,"sd":1401.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21366472","38775253","27514750","26927285","26041600","25543972","23250981","23194486"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":69,"n":156},"commonTop":[]}}
