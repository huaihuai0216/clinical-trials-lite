Male or female participants 18 years of age or older.\n2. Multiple myeloma diagnosed according to standard criteria either currently or at the time of initial diagnosis.\n\n   NOTE: The initial diagnosis must have been symptomatic multiple myeloma, although the relapsed disease did not need to be symptomatic.\n3. Must have had measurable disease, defined by at least 1 of the following 3 measurements:\n\n   * Serum M-protein ≥ 1 g/dL (≥ 10 g/L).\n   * Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours.\n   * Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level ≥ 10 mg/dL (≥ 100 mg/L), provided that the serum FLC ratio was abnormal.\n4. Participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had received 1 to 3 prior therapies.\n\n   NOTE: population included the following 3 categories of participants:\n   * Participants who relapsed from their previous treatment(s) but were not refractory to any previous treatment.\n   * Participants who were refractory to all lines of previous treatment(s) (ie, participants who had never responded to any therapies received).\n   * Participants who relapsed from at least 1 previous treatment AND additionally were refractory to at least 1 previous treatment. For the purposes of this study, refractory disease was defined as disease progression on treatment or progression within 60 days after the last dose of a given therapy.\n\n   A line of therapy was defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment program. This may have consisted of 1 or more planned cycles of single-agent therapy or combination therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, followed by maintenance was considered 1 line of therapy. Autologous and allogenic transplants were permitted.\n5. Must have met the following clinical laboratory criteria:\n\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm\\^3 and platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm\\^3.

(Periodic abstinence \\[eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods\\] and withdrawal were not acceptable methods of contraception.) OR\n   * Agreed to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and 90 days after the last dose of study treatment if their partner was of childbearing potential, even if they had a successful vasectomy, AND\n   * Must have also adhered to the guidelines of the RevAssist program (US participants), RevAid program (Canadian participants), iAccess program (Australian participants), RevMate program (Japanese participants) or The Lenalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan as outlined in the study Manual (all other participants who were not using commercial supplies)\n9. Must have been able to take concurrent aspirin 81 to 325 mg daily (or enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily \\[or its equivalent\\] if allergic to aspirin), per published standard or institutional standard of care, as prophylactic anticoagulation.\n\n   NOTE: For participants with prior history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was mandatory.\n10.
