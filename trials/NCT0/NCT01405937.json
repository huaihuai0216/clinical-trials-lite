The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks after completion of all study therapy (SVR24) in at least one of the vaniprevir 300 mg twice daily treatment regimens is greater than 20% (historical data of standard of care treatment).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks After Completion of All Study Therapy (SVR24)","timeFrame":"24 weeks after 24 weeks of study therapy (up to 48 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vaniprevir 12 Week Arm","deltaMin":92,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vaniprevir 24 Week Arm","deltaMin":96.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26936417","26947564"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":25},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Haemoglobin decreased","Headache","Nausea","White blood cell count decreased"]}}
