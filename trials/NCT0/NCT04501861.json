It quantifies how much the myocardium in the free wall of the right ventricle shortens along its longitudinal axis (base to apex) during systole (contraction). It is expressed as a negative percentage (%), where more negative values indicate better contractility (e.g., -20% is better than -10%). In this study, it was measured by transesophageal echocardiography in the 2D mid-esophageal four-chamber view during a steady state period after chest closure","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-18.2","spread":"8.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-19.4","spread":"7.2"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-17.5","spread":"8.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-18.9","spread":"8.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-19.2","spread":"8.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-20.0","spread":"5.7"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}}
