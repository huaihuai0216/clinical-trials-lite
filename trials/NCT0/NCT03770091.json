Treatment modalities are both conservative and surgical with surgical options including osteotomy, bone excision, ligament reconstruction, and various prosthetic implants. The conservative treatment options, however, are limited to NSAIDs and bracing or steroid injections.\n\nAdvances in topical therapies have the potential to deliver focused treatment to the CMC joint. Novel treatment of inflammation can potentially reduce inflammation and pain associated with progressing osteoarthritis. Theraworx Relief is an FDA registered foam that has theoretical impact on inflammation reduction in human subjects treated with the topical foam.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Numeric Pain Rating Scale","timeFrame":"2 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Foam and Compression Wrap","deltaMin":1.7,"sd":1.3},{"arm":"Placebo Foam and Compression Wrap","deltaMin":2.4,"sd":1.5},{"arm":"Foam Alone","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":2.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.6"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
