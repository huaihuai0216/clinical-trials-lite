In the preceding 6 months prior to screening, one episode of \"blip\" (HIV-1 RNA \\> 50 and \\< 400 copies/mL) is acceptable, only if HIV-1 RNA is \\< 50 copies/mL immediately before and after the \"blip\".\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA level \\< 50 copies/mL at screening visit\n* Adequate renal function\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (eGFRCG) and are on ARVs that are appropriately dose adjusted for renal function per package insert\n* All documented historical plasma genotype(s) must not show resistance to TDF or FTC, including, but not limited to the presence of reverse transcriptase resistance mutations K65R, K70E, M184V/I, or thymidine analog-associated mutations (TAMs) that include M41L, L210W, D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, K219Q/E/N/R.
