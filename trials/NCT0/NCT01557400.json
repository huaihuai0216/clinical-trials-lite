Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the participant (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial. Note: If the study candidate is considered a child under local regulation, a parent or legal guardian must provide written consent prior to initiation of study screening procedures and the study candidate may be required to provide written assent. The rules of the responsible Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) regarding whether 1 or both parents must provide consent and the appropriate ages for obtaining consent and assent from the participant should be followed.\n2. History of exposure to ataluren in a prior PTC study in nmDBMD. Note: Participants are considered eligible only if they received ataluren during their participation in 1 or more prior PTC-sponsored studies of ataluren in nmDBMD. Note: Participants who have participated in a prior or ongoing PTC study with ataluren in nmDBMD at a trial site in the US or Canada, but reside outside of the US and Canada, may be eligible for this study (with the approval of the PTC Therapeutics Medical Monitor).\n3. Male sex.\n4. In participants who are sexually active, willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during ataluren administration and the 6-week follow-up period.\n5. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, study procedures, laboratory tests, and study restrictions. Note: Psychological, social, familial, or geographical factors that might preclude adequate study participation should be considered.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Exposure to another investigational drug within 1 month prior to start of study treatment.\n2. Eligibility for another ataluren clinical trial that is actively enrolling study participants.\n3. Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients or excipients of ataluren (Litesse速 UltraTM \\[refined polydextrose\\], polyethylene glycol 3350, Lutrol速 micro F127 \\[poloxamer 407\\], mannitol 25C, crospovidone XL10, hydroxyethyl cellulose, vanilla, Cab-O-Sil速 M5P \\[colloidal silica\\], magnesium stearate).\n4. Ongoing use of the following medications:\n\n   1. Coumarin-based anticoagulants (for example, warfarin), phenytoin, tolbutamide, or paclitaxel.\n   2. Systemic aminoglycoside therapy\n5. Ongoing uncontrolled medical/surgical condition, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of the participant or make it unlikely that follow-up would be completed.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","genderBased":true,"genderDescription":"Male participants only are being studied.","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","description":"A TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence or undesirable event(s) experienced in a participant that begins or worsens following administration of the study drug or study treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment by the Investigator.

AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs.

The sum of these 17 scores was used to form a total score. If fewer than 13 of the 17 activities were performed, the total score was considered missing. If 13 to 16 activities were performed, the total score was calculated by multiplying the sum of the scores in the x activities that were performed by 17/x. If an activity could not be performed due to disease progression/loss of ambulation, a score of 0 was assigned. The linear score was the linear transformation of the NSAA score to a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.9","spread":"3.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-7.4","spread":"5.61"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-8.8","spread":"6.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-13.4","spread":"7.03"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Time to Stand From Supine Position","description":"Time to stand from the supine position to a standing position was assessed in ambulatory participants.
