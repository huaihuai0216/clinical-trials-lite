Written informed consent prior to the performance of any study-related activity.\n2. Patients 18 years and older with an average of ≥ 2 nocturnal voids per night as determined by a 3 day frequency-volume chart during the screening period.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nMales:\n\n1. Clinical suspicion of bladder outlet obstruction and/or urine flow \\< 5 ml/s.
