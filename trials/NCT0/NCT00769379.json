Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy is more effective with or without trastuzumab in treating ductal carcinoma in situ.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Ipsilateral Invasive Breast Cancer, Ipsilateral Skin Cancer Recurrence, or Ipsilateral DCIS-Free Survival","timeFrame":"5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Standard WBI)","deltaMin":95.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (WBI, Trastuzumab)","deltaMin":96.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1260,"countries":["United States","Canada","Puerto Rico","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33739848","23984897"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":998},"commonTop":["Dermatitis radiation","Fatigue"]}}
