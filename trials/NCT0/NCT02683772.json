The aim of this study is to now compare the Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (AutoEPAP) algorithm with a fixed manual EPAP in iVAPS mode on an Astral mixed mode ventilator. It is proposed that the automatic settings of AutoEPAP will be as effective at managing respiratory failure and upper airway obstruction (UAO) as manual EPAP on the Astral device. Specifically demonstrating that the AutoEPAP function is as effective at treating UAO as manual EPAP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Oxygen Desaturation Index 4% (ODI4%)","timeFrame":"Overnight, up to 8 hrs on nights 1 and 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"iVAPS With AutoEPAP","deltaMin":3.16,"sd":5.67},{"arm":"iVAPS With Manual EPAP","deltaMin":7.61,"sd":18.87}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0134"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17565016","11296176","670014","16299118","12826594","31120585","31012225"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":42},"commonTop":["Asthma exacerbation"]}}
