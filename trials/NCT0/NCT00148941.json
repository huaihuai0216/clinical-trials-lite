Vaccines will be co-administered with the second dose of M-M-RII, which is recommended at this age. Concomitant administration of a US-licensed influenza vaccine will be allowed according to seasonal availability of vaccine and at the discretion of the investigator.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) for Anti-diphtheria (Anti-D) and Anti-tetanus (Anti-T) Antibodies in a Subset of Subjects","timeFrame":"At Month 1 (i.e. one month after vaccination)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SB213503 Lot 1 + M-M-R Group","deltaMin":16.704,"sd":null},{"arm":"SB213503 Lot 2 + M-M-R Group","deltaMin":18.658,"sd":null},{"arm":"SB213503 Lot 3 + M-M-R Group","deltaMin":18.437,"sd":null},{"arm":"Infanrix + IPOL + M-M-R Group","deltaMin":18.112,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18316985","18980534"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":1053},"commonTop":["Pain","Erythema","Swelling","Pyrexia","Somnolence"]}}
