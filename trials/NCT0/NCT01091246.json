study\n* Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might compromise the safety of the subject in the study or would interfere with evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the investigational products\n* Subject, legal representative, or immediate family member of subject who is an employee of the clinical study site or who is otherwise involved with the conduct of the study\n* A history of epilepsy, seizure, or an evolving neurological condition except that of a single febrile seizure that occurred 3 or more years prior to enrollment would not disqualify a subject\n\nNote: an individual who initially is excluded from study participation based on one or more of the above time-limited criteria may be reconsidered for enrollment once the condition has
