Tiotropium inhalation solution delivered by the Respimat® inhaler will be examined as add-on controller therapy on top of usual care in patients with severe persistent asthma. The primary objective of each trial is to evaluate the long term efficacy of tiotropium over placebo on top of usual care in patients with severe persistent asthma as determined by pulmonary function testing, effects on asthma exacerbations, effects on quality of life, on asthma control and health care resource utilisation. The secondary objective of each trial is to compare the long term safety of tiotropium with placebo in this patient population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Response Within 3 Hours Post Dosing (0-3h) After a Treatment Period of 24 Weeks.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.248,"sd":0.024},{"arm":"Tio R5","deltaMin":0.401,"sd":0.025}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":75,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Denmark","Germany","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Russia","Serbia","South Africa","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36472162","31319851","29174062","22938706"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":234},"commonTop":["Asthma","Peak expiratory flow rate decreased","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Sinusitis"]}}
