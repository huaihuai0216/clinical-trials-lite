The PANSS items are divided into positive, negative, and general psychopathology factors. Items are rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extremely severe). The PANSS-T score is the sum of scores for all 30 PANSS items (i.e., the sum of the three subscales), with a minimum score of 30 and a maximum score of 210. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-12.0","spread":"1.03"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-12.3","spread":"1.44"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-7.1","spread":"1.48"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":300},"commonTop":["Headache","Sedation","Dizziness","Nausea","Dyspepsia"]}}}
