When people undergo surgery or certain procedures, they must stop using warfarin to prevent too much bleeding during and after the surgery or procedure. Some doctors prescribe a different blood thinner, one that works more quickly and wears off more quickly, to bridge the gap between starting and stopping warfarin. However, this short-term treatment is expensive, may increase the risk of bleeding, and has not been proven effective. This study will determine whether a bridging blood thinner called dalteparin is helpful or harmful for people with atrial fibrillation who stop taking warfarin in preparation for surgery or a procedure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Arterial Thromboembolic Events","timeFrame":"from subject signing of the consent until completed the study (Day -30 to Day +37)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dalteparin","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27280017","26095867","22244711"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":66,"n":950},"commonTop":[]}}
