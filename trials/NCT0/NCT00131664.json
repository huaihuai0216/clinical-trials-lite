According to recent Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines glucose control, based on the A1C measurement, needs to be achieved within a 6-12 month period of time after the initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The guidelines on the use of antihyperglycemic agents identify the potential benefits of sub-maximal oral combination therapy in order to achieve more rapid and improved glycemic control compared with higher dose monotherapy. Furthermore, many patients on prolonged oral antihyperglycemic monotherapy who then start on combination therapy may not achieve the required target glycemic control. Indeed early initiation of combination therapies may be necessary to achieve and maintain glycemic targets because of the progressive deterioration of pancreatic β cell function and glycemic control.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in A1C at Month 6","timeFrame":"Baseline and Month 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Avandia and Amaryl","deltaMin":8.14,"sd":0.095},{"arm":"Avandamet","deltaMin":7.96,"sd":0.076},{"arm":"Metformin","deltaMin":7.9,"sd":0.085}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.chrc.net"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":136},"commonTop":["Fracture"]}}
