The consequences of CN include ulcerations of the foot and ankle, osteomyelitis, and severe musculoskeletal deformity. These consequences frequently lead to below-knee amputation of the affected limb.\n\nCurrently treatment options are limited, and no pharmaceutical treatment has been efficacious in the medical literature. The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the potential of the medication denosumab for acute stage Charcot neuroarthropathy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]","timeFrame":"1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention Group, Receiving Medication","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":7},"commonTop":["Muscle pain, upper extremity","Cellulitis"]}}
