After two weeks of applications, patients had to answer DMQ 1 again as well as an additional questionnaire (DMQ 2) about the efficacy of the sprays. Increased DMQ scores indicate improvement of xerostomia. DMQ 1 was used to assess the initial severity of oral dryness and in particular its impact on oral function: problems when chewing, swallowing, speaking and general impact on daily life.\n\nDMQ 1 used a 0-to-4 rating scale where 0 = \"very dry\" and 4 = \"not dry at all.\" After two weeks of treatment, DMQ 1 was repeated and it was included DMQ 2.\n\nAt the end values of DMQ 1 and DMQ 2 were summed","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.4","spread":"0.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.4","spread":"0.5"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Sialometries","description":"Unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow rates were assessed in all patients.
