Chemotherapy combinations may include, but are not limited to: CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), FCM (Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone), R-FCM (Rituximab,Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone), ICE(Ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), DHAP (Dexamethasone, cisplatin, cytarabine) and hyper-CVAD (Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects who are less than or equal to six month from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and who are on immunosuppressive therapy or have evidence of graft versus host disease\n* Prior investigational therapy within 3 weeks of first dose. Investigational therapy is defined as treatment that is not approved for any indication.\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema, requirement for corticosteroids and/or progressive growth.
