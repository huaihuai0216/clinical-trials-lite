The primary objective of this extension study was to collect long-term safety and clinical outcome data in Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), also known as Hunter Syndrome, from the Phase 2/Phase 3 Study TKT024. All patients enrolling into this study received weekly active treatment with idursulfase, the primary dosing regimen investigated in Study TKT024.\n\nHunter Syndrome is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of iduronate-2-sulfatase, an enzyme required to catabolize glycosaminoglycans (GAGS) in cells. As a result, GAGs accumulate in the lysosomes leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, tissue destruction, and organ system dysfunction. Hunter Syndrome is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1 in 162,000 live births.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Mean Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Week 105","timeFrame":"Baseline and at Week 105","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Idursulfase (0.5 mg/kg, IV, Once-weekly)","deltaMin":-0.056,"sd":1.059}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Romania","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17185020","16912578","21150784","22929184"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":94},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Cough","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection nos","Pharyngitis"]}}
