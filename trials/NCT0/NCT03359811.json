Both are types of anesthetics but are given in different ways. A 4Q-TAP block is when anesthetic injections are given in 4 different parts of the abdomen. A TEA is when an anesthetic injection is given in the space surrounding the spinal cord through your back.\n\nThis is an investigational study. The surgery and the levels of anesthetic participant is receiving are standard-of-care. It is investigational to compare 4Q-TAP block with TEA.\n\nUp to 140 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy of TEA vs 4Q-TAP in QoR at Postoperative Day (POD)2","timeFrame":"48 hours after CRS-HIPEC surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard-of-Care Thoracic Epidural Analgesia (TEA)","deltaMin":-45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Four Quadrant Transverse Abdominus Plane (4Q-TAP) Block","deltaMin":-50,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":33},"commonTop":["Nausea","Hypotension","Dry mouth","Pruritus","Low urinary input"]}}
