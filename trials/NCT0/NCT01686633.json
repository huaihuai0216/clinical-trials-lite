The study consists of a run-in period of 4 weeks, followed by a treatment period of 12 weeks, and a follow up contact period of one week. The total duration of the study is 17 weeks. 990 subjects will be randomized to one of three treatments (FF/VI Inhalation Powder 200/25 mcg once daily in the evening; FF/VI Inhalation Powder 100/25 mcg once daily in the evening; FF 100 Inhalation Powder once daily in the evening) for 12 weeks. In addition, all subjects will be supplied albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol at Visit 1 to use as needed for acute asthma symptoms throughout the entire study. Subjects will attend four on-treatment visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (Visits 4 through 7).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Over 0 to 24 Hours Post-dose at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FF 100 µg OD","deltaMin":0.366,"sd":0.0231},{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 µg OD","deltaMin":0.474,"sd":0.0221},{"arm":"FF/VI 200/25 µg OD","deltaMin":0.499,"sd":0.0222}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":136,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Chile","Germany","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","Sweden","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36472162","26291137"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":347},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
