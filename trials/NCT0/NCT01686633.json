A stable mid-dose or high-dose of ICS alone (e.g., \\>=FP 250 mcg twice daily) or b.) A stable dose of a mid-dose ICS/LABA combination (e.g., FP/Salmeterol \\[SALM\\] 250/50 mcg twice daily) or an equivalent combination via separate inhalers.\n* Use of ICS/LABA are not permitted with LABA on the day of Visit 1.\n* Must be able to replace current SABA treatment with albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler at Visit 1 for use as needed, during the study. Subjects must be able to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 6 hours prior to study visits\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of life-threatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures within the last 5 years.\n* Upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is: not resolved within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the investigator, expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n* Any asthma exacerbation that required oral corticosteroids within the 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 or, resulted in an overnight hospitalization requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n* A subject must not have current evidence of atelectasis (segmental or larger), bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Or any evidence of concurrent respiratory disease other than asthma\n* A subject must not have any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study\n* Chronic stable hepatitis B or C are acceptable provided their screening alanine transaminase (ALT) is \\<2x upper limit of normal (ULN) and the y otherwise meet the entry criteria.

A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products within the past 3 months (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco).\n* If subject is an immediate family member of the participating investigator, sub-investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating investigator.\n* Subject previously randomized to treatment with FF/VI or FF in another Phase III study\n* Subjects working on night shift a week prior to Visit 1 or during the study period.\n* Adolescents who are wards of the state or government","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Over 0 to 24 Hours Post-dose at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period","description":"Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second.
