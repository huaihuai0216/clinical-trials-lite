Medications that become standard of care for COVID-19 and/or receive emergency use authorization may be allowed after discussion with the medical monitor.\n* If subject is receiving or has received hydroxychloroquine within 3 months prior to screening visit, a corrected QT interval by Federicia method (QTcF) on Screening electrocardiogram (ECG) ≥500ms is exclusionary. If subject has a pacemaker, this criterion does not apply.\n* Enrolled in another investigational study of a medical intervention within 30 days prior to randomization. Participation in open label trials involving investigational treatments for COVID-19 may be allowed upon approval by the Sponsor.\n* Life expectancy less than 48 hours, in the opinion of the Investigator\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus infection (regardless of immunological status), known hepatitis B virus surface antigen positivity and/or anti-hepatitis C virus positivity","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Cohort 1, Phase 2: Percentage of Participants Alive and Free of Mechanical Ventilation at Day 29","description":"Mechanical ventilation is defined as invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
