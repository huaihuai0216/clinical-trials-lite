Male or female at least 9 years of age and older;\n2. Written and verbal informed consent must be obtained. Subjects less than age of consent must sign an assent for the study and a parent or a legal guardian must sign the informed consent (if subject reaches age of consent during the study they should be re-consented at the next study visit);\n3. Subject must have a score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) on the Evaluator's Global Severity Score (EGSS) assessment at the baseline visit;\n4. Subjects with facial acne inflammatory lesion (papules, pustules, and nodules) count no less than 20 but no more than 50;\n5. Subjects with facial acne non-inflammatory lesion (open and closed comedones) count no less than 25 but no more than 100;\n6. Subjects with two or fewer facial nodules\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Use of an investigational drug or device within 30 days of enrollment or participation in a research study concurrent with this study;\n2. Any dermatological conditions on the face that could interfere with clinical evaluations such as acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne, perioral dermatitis, clinically significant rosacea, gram-negative folliculitis, dermatitis, eczema;\n3. Any underlying disease(s) or some other dermatological condition of the face that requires the use of interfering topical or systemic therapy or makes evaluations and lesion count inconclusive;\n4. Subjects with a facial beard or mustache that could interfere with the study assessments;\n5. Subjects with more than two (2) facial nodules;\n6.
