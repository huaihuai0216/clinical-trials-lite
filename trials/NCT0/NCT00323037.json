NOTE: Female subjects must be post-menopausal (i.e., no menstrual period for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening), surgically sterilized, using a double barrier method contraceptive, or using Depo-Provera or implanted contraceptives for at least one month prior to screening and agree to continue to use the same contraceptive method throughout the study.\n* Use of an investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment\n* Participation in an investigational device trial within 30 days of enrollment\n* Known drug or alcohol abuse 1 year prior to enrollment\n* In the opinion of the investigator the subject is known to be noncompliant with prescribed medication regimen\n* Has any systemic disease, including cancer, with reduced life expectancy (\\<12 months)\n* Has a history of psychological illness/condition that interferes with ability to understand or complete requirements of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume Index (LVESVI) Characterized by 2-D Echocardiography","description":"Maintenance Visit 3 minus Baseline.
