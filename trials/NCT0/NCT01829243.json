The minimum score = 9 and maximum score possible = 63. Higher scores = greater fatigue severity.\n\nSample questions include \"I am easily fatigued\" and \"Exercise brings on my fatigue.\" In the initial validation study, internal consistency for the Fatigue Severity Scale was high for specific illness groups (MS and lupus) and healthy controls. The scale clearly distinguished patients from controls and it was moderately correlated with a single-item visual analogue scale of fatigue intensity. In all patients, clinical improvement in fatigue was associated with reductions in scores on the Fatigue Severity Scale. The Fatigue Severity Scale is also a practical measure due to its brevity and ease of administration and scoring.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"56.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"49.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"53.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"52.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"52.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"53.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Composite Brief Assessment of Cognition (BAC) Score","description":"The composite BAC score is calculated by scoring each of the 6 individual tests (Verbal Memory Recall, Digit Sequencing, Token Motor Task, Verbal Fluency, Symbol Coding, and Tower of London), comparing each score to a healthy control sample to create z-scores, summing the z-scores, and rescaling the sum.
