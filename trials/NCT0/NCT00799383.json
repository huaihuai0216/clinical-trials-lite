We hypothesize that, by the end of the stuy, children in the supplementation group will have higher bone mineral density compared to those in the placebo group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Trabecular Bone Mineral Density in the Ultradistal Radius","timeFrame":"36 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Calcium+VitD","deltaMin":192.9,"sd":31.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":197.2,"sd":43.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29112461"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["Stomach ache","Constipation","Nausea/Vomiting","Diarrhea","Urinary calcium/Creatinine Ratio"]}}
