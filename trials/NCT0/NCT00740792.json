Sleep disturbance\n  2. Impairment of daily activities, leisure and/or sport\n  3. Impairment of school or work\n  4. Troublesome symptoms\n* Screening Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS of at least 8 of 12 and a congestion score of 2 or 3 on Visit 1\n* Randomization Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS (AM or PM) of at least 8 on 3 separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of Day 1, and can include the morning of Day 1) during the Lead-in Period.\n* Randomization Visit: Have an AM or PM 12-hour reflective nasal congestion score of 2 or 3 must have been recorded on 3 separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of Day 1, and can include the morning of Day 1) Randomization Visit: Have an instantaneous TNSS score of 8 or more at time point zero, just prior to beginning the onset of action assessment\n* Have taken at least 10 doses of the lead-in medication\n* Willing and able to comply with the study requirementsAt least a 2-year history of SAR during Fall allergy season\n* The presence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a local Fall pollen, confirmed by a positive response to skin prick within the last year. A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the negative control.\n* General good health and free of disease or concomitant treatment that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results\n* Subjects receiving immunotherapy injections (antigen desensitization) must be on a stable maintenance regimen for at least 30 days before the first study visit\n* Subjects currently receiving sublingual immunotherapy are excluded.
