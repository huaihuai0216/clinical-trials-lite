Men or women \\> 18 years having IDA caused by different aetiologies such as abnormal uterine bleeding, gastrointestinal diseases, cancer, bariatric procedures (gastric bypass operations), and other conditions leading to significant blood loss and with a documented history of intolerance or unresponsiveness to oral iron therapy for at least one month prior to study enrollment or where there at investigators judgment is a clinical need to deliver iron rapidly\n2. Hb \\< 11 g/dL\n3. TSAT \\< 20 %\n4. S-ferritin \\< 100 ng/mL\n5. Willingness to participate and signing the informed consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Anaemia predominantly caused by factors other than IDA (e.g. anaemia with untreated vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, haemolytic anaemia)\n2. Iron overload or disturbances in utilisation of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis and haemosiderosis)\n3. Decompensated liver cirrhosis or active hepatitis (ALAT \\> 3 times upper limit of normal)\n4. Active acute or chronic infections (assessed by clinical judgement supplied with white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP))\n5. Body weight \\< 50 kg\n6. Rheumatoid arthritis with symptoms or signs of active inflammation\n7. Pregnant or nursing women. In order to avoid pregnancy, women have to be surgically sterile or use adequate contraception (e.g. intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives, or double barrier method) during the whole study period and after the study has ended for at least 5 times plasma biological half-life of the investigational medicinal product\n8. History of multiple allergies\n9. Known hypersensitivity to parenteral iron or any excipients in the investigational drug products\n10. Erythropoietin treatment within 8 weeks prior to the screening visit\n11. Other iron treatment or blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit\n12. Planned elective surgery during the study\n13. Participation in any other clinical study within 3 months prior to the screening\n14.
