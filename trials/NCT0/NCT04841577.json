Participants with chronic stable medical conditions with or without specific treatment are allowed to participate in this study if considered by the investigator as medically stable.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nMedical conditions\n\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* History of GBS, anaphylaxis, febrile seizures, Bell's palsy and narcolepsy.\n* Serious or unstable chronic illness.\n* Any history of dementia or any medical condition that moderately or severely impairs cognition.\n* Recurrent or un-controlled neurological disorders or seizures. Participants with medically-controlled active or chronic neurological diseases can be enrolled in the study as per investigator assessment, provided that their condition will allow them to comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of diary cards, attend regular phone calls/study site visits).\n* Significant underlying illness that in the opinion of the investigator would be expected to prevent completion of the study\n* Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n\nPrior/Concomitant therapy\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug, vaccine or medical device) other than the study interventions during the period beginning 30 days before the first dose of study vaccines and ending 30 days after the last vaccine administration, or planned use during the study period.\n* Administration of an influenza vaccine during the 6 months preceding the study FLU-QIV administration.\n* Planned or actual administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first study intervention administration and ending 30 days after the last study intervention administration.\n\nNote: In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat is recommended and/or organized by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunization program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that vaccine provided it is used according to the local governmental recommendations and that the Sponsor is notified accordingly.\n\n* Previous vaccination with an RSV vaccine.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs or planned administration at any time during the study period).\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives during the period starting 90 days before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 90 days prior to the first study vaccination or planned administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n\nPrior/Concurrent clinical study experience\n\n• Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the participant has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational intervention (drug/invasive medical device).\n\nOther exclusions\n\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential participant unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports or comply with study procedures.\n* Planned move during the study conduct that prohibits participation until 1 month post-last vaccine administration.\n* Bedridden participants.\n* Participation of any study personnel or their immediate dependents, family, or household members.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"RSV-A Neutralization Antibody Titers Expressed as Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs)","description":"The serum neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum antibodies to neutralize RSV-A entry and replication in a host cell line.
