Participants with negative test results were to be considered treatment successes. Patients who tested positive for H. pylori infection, and those with indeterminate, not assessable, or missing results were to be considered treatment failures. The statistical hypothesis that the active treatment is superior to 70% was to be tested against the alternative hypothesis that the active treatment is statistically indistinguishable or less than 70% effective using a one-sample Z-test.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"59","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"H.
