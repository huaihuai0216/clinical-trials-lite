Patients must meet criteria for acute lung injury\n\n   * Intubated, mechanically ventilated, with respiratory failure secondary to diffuse, bilateral parenchymal lung disease (as judged by chest x-ray).\n   * Oxygenation index (OI) \\> 13, but \\< 37, for two consecutive blood gases which should be separated by at least one hour within 48 hours of the initiation of mechanical ventilation.\n   * Arterial catheter placement\n   * Parental informed consent\n2. Patients must have a diagnosis of leukemia/lymphoma undergoing active treatment or following HSCT for any indication. Leukemia/lymphoma will be defined according to the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Collaborative Staging Manual including those conditions defined as borderline such as myelodysplastic syndromes. All forms of HSCT will be eligible, allogeneic as well as autologous.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure and/or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure \\>15 mmHg, or uncorrected congenital heart disease.\n2. Glasgow Coma Score \\< 8 (prior to respiratory failure).\n3. Pre-existing limitations on care options, (Do Not Attempt Resuscitation Orders, etc).\n4. Patients with impending death from another disease.\n5. Patients moribund or with other organ failure at possible randomization:\n\n   * hypotension unresponsive to treatment (mean BP \\< 60 or \\< 5th % for age),\n   * persistent cardiac tachyarrhythmia \\>150/minute, or persistent bradyarrythmia \\< 50/minute, or age appropriate criteria for younger children,\n   * metabolic acidosis \\> - 10 milliequivalent (mEq)/L for more than 2 hours,\n   * persistent arterial oxygen desaturation, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) \\< 50 or oxygen saturation (SaO2) saturation \\< 80%,\n   * hyperkalemia, serum K+ \\> 6.5 plus widening of QRS complex on EKG (QRS complex corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of the heart).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Months","maximumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"All-cause Mortality at the Time of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) Discharge","description":"Overall mortality rate from admission to PICU discharge","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Ventilator Free Days (VFDs)","description":"Number of days the patient is alive and off of the ventilator","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.40","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Total Duration of Stay Required","description":"Length of stay (LOS) ,measured in days, from admission to PICU discharge and admission to hospital discharge.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"65","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Oxygenation: First Intervention","description":"The Oxygenation Index after the first intervention is calculated as the fraction of inspired oxygen, in percent, times the mean airway pressure, in mmHg, divided by the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, in mmHg.
