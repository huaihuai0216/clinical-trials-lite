Improvement From Baseline in PASI Through Week 56","description":"The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas is assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90%-100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that could range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.30","spread":"20.743"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24.72","spread":"20.711"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37.85","spread":"23.567"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.56","spread":"23.600"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.76","spread":"24.186"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"60.57","spread":"21.871"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"64.63","spread":"22.862"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"72.80","spread":"19.478"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"84.36","spread":"17.278"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"89.40","spread":"13.579"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"90.85","spread":"14.484"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"92.60","spread":"13.703"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"93.65","spread":"12.849"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"93.94","spread":"12.123"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.35","spread":"11.525"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"94.41","spread":"12.152"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.27","spread":"9.848"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"93.75","spread":"14.314"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.58","spread":"9.663"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"92.96","spread":"16.835"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.74","spread":"9.336"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"92.95","spread":"16.641"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.45","spread":"11.119"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"92.40","spread":"17.125"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.78","spread":"10.456"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.77","spread":"17.733"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.45","spread":"12.293"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.34","spread":"18.246"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.76","spread":"11.629"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"90.87","spread":"19.181"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"93.35","spread":"16.116"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"81.67","spread":"27.627"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":534},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Headache","Arthralgia","Diarrhoea"]}}}
