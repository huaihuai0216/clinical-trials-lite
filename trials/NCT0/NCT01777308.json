For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the study vaccine dose, with the exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine which can be administered at any time during the study according to the local recommendations.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product.\n* Previous vaccination with meningococcal vaccine except the meningococcal vaccination received in the Hib-MenC-TT-016 study.\n* History of meningococcal disease.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital or secondary), including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)infection, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).\n* Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, and history of serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) following the administration of vaccine(s).\n* Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.\n* History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GBS. History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the study vaccination or planned administration during the booster vaccination phase of the study (i.e. between Visit 1 and Visit 2) and within 3 months preceding the blood sampling at Visit 3.\n\nThe following criteria should be checked for the long-term persistence phase at two years after booster vaccination (Visit 3):\n\nIn case an exclusion criterion becomes applicable, the subject will not enter the long-term follow-up and the reason will be documented.\n\n* Previous administration of a meningococcal vaccine with the exception of the meningococcal vaccination given in the primary study and the booster vaccination in this particular study.\n* History of meningococcal disease.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"84 Months","maximumAge":"95
