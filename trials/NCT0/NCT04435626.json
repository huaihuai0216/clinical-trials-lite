Researchers will also collect information on how much the heart disease has impact on patient's lives, change of kidney function, and how well finerenone treatment is tolerated. The study plans to enroll 6000 male and female patients of the age of 40 years and above suffering from heart failure with ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40%. Participants will take the study product as oral tablet with a dose between 0 (Placebo) 40 mg once daily. Study duration will be up to 43 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Occurrence of the Composite Endpoint of Cardiovascular Death and Total (First and Recurrent) Heart Failure Events","timeFrame":"From randomization up until the end of study, with an average study duration of 32 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Finerenone (BAY94-8862)","deltaMin":1083,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1283,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0072"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":661,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Colombia","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Lithuania","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38944793","39232490","39217560","38740173","38744407","39225278","38733212","38742248","39218030","39217561","40916719","40857999","40802267","40531488","40397470","40377184","40377177","40300840","40232214","40222820","40208137","40159247","40156827","40042880","40009358","39818225","39665701","39550721","39550716","39490700","39342512","39340828","39332395"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/study/20103"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1157,"n":2993},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Hyperkalaemia","Hypotension","Anaemia","Dizziness"]}}
