A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) could have been performed for patients with a borderline skin prick test result after consultation with Novartis clinical personnel.\n* Patients with ≥ 12% increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over starting value within 30 minutes of taking up to 4 puffs (4x100 µg) salbutamol (albuterol) or nebulized salbutamol up to 5 mg (or equivalent of alternative B2-agonist) documented within the past year, at screening, during the run-in period, or prior to randomization. Patients were not to take their long acting B2-agonist (LABA) medication within 12 hours of reversibility testing.\n* Clinical features of moderate or severe persistent asthma (at least step 3) despite therapy at step 3 or 4 (at least medium dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) - fluticasone dry-powder inhaler (DPI) ≥ 200 mg/day or equivalent with or without other controller medications).\n* Documented history of experiencing asthma exacerbations and demonstrated inadequate symptom control during the last 4 weeks of run-in despite receiving an equivalent dose of fluticasone DPI ≥ 200 mg/day total daily ex-valve dose.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Patients who received systemic corticosteroids for reasons other than asthma, beta-adrenergic antagonists by any route, anticholinergics within 24 hours of Screening, methotrexate, gold salts, cyclosporin or troleandomycin, or had received desensitization therapy with less than 3 months of stable maintenance doses prior to Screening.\n* Patients with a history of food or drug related severe anaphylactoid or anaphylactic reaction, a history of allergy to antibiotics, with aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)-related asthma (unless the NSAID could be avoided), with active lung disease or acute sinusitis/chest infection, elevated serum IgE levels for other reasons, presence/history of a clinically significant uncontrolled systemic disease, cancer, abnormal, electrocardiogram (ECG) in the previous month, or platelets ≤ 100 x 109/L or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at Screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Years","maximumAge":"11 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Mean Nocturnal Asthma Symptom Score From Baseline to the End (Last 4 Weeks) of the 24-week Fixed-dose Steroid Treatment Period","description":"Nocturnal asthma symptom was measured daily on a scale of 0 to 4 in response to the question \"How did you sleep last night?\", with 0 as the best response and 4 as the worst response.
