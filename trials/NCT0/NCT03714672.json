Participants requiring immediate dental procedures other than third and fourth molars extraction,\n\n    Exclusion Criteria at the Allocation Visit:\n11. Participant received a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug within 24 hours or 5 times the elimination half-life of that drug prior to surgery, whatever the longer.\n12. Participant received any analgesic medication other than short-acting pre-operative or intra-operative anesthetic agents within 24 hours before taking IMPs.\n13. Participant received more than 300 mg of lidocaine in total.\n14. Participant received any analgesic medication other than the IMPs immediately after the oral surgical procedure was completed.\n15.
