Tramadol and diclofenac each relieve pain, but they do so by different mechanisms. They were used alone as comparator drug in this study. Both are marketed drugs and are standard treatment for acute pain, including wisdom tooth removal.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Relief Expressed as Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Over the 4 Hours Post-dose Period (TOTPAR4)","timeFrame":"Up to 4 hours after first dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tramadol/Diclofenac 50/50","deltaMin":9.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tramadol/Diclofenac 25/25","deltaMin":8.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tramadol 50","deltaMin":5.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Diclofenac 50","deltaMin":5.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":208},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Procedural pain","Dizziness","Headache"]}}
