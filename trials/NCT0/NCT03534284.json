Chronic insomnia is disrupted sleep that occurs at least three nights per week and lasts at least three months.\n\nThe SLEEP-HD study is a randomized open-label clinical trial to compare two types of treatment for insomnia in participants who have end-stage renal disease on HD, and who have been diagnosed with chronic insomnia. The two types of treatment involved in the study are Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) or treatment with a drug (trazodone vs placebo).\n\n126 participants will be enrolled who are undergoing HD in two study locations (Seattle, Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Short-term","timeFrame":"Week 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CBT-I","deltaMin":12.47,"sd":null},{"arm":"Medication- Trazodone","deltaMin":11.97,"sd":null},{"arm":"Medication- Placebo","deltaMin":13.05,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.6761"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38224591","33081705"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":43},"commonTop":["Hospitalization / Death","Hospitalization / Death","Hospitalization / Death","Hospitalization / Death","Hospitalization / Death"]}}
