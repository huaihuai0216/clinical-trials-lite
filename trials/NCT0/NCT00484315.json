Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\n* Documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian Cardiovascular Society \\[CCS\\] Classification 1, 2, 3, or 4) or unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Class IB-C, IIB-C, or IIIB-C), or documented silent ischemia\n* Acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is ≥ 30%\n* Subject (or legal guardian) understands the study requirements and the treatment procedures and provides written Informed Consent before any study-specific tests or procedures are performed\n* Subject willing to comply with all specified follow-up evaluations\n\nClinical Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Contraindication to aspirin (ASA), or to both clopidogrel and ticlopidine\n* Known hypersensitivity to paclitaxel\n* Known allergy to stainless steel\n* Known allergy to platinum\n* Previous treatment of the target vessel with any anti-restenotic drug-coated or drug-eluting coronary stent\n* Previous treatment of the target vessel with a bare metal stent (BMS) within 9 months of the index procedure\n* Previous treatment of any non-target vessel with any anti-restenotic drug-coated or drug-eluting coronary stent within 9 months of the index procedure\n* Previous treatment with intravascular brachytherapy in the target vessel\n* Planned PCI or CABG post-index procedure\n* Planned or actual target vessel treatment with an unapproved device, directional or rotational coronary atherectomy, laser, cutting balloon or transluminal extraction catheter immediately prior to stent placement\n* Myocardial infarction (MI) within 72 hours prior to index procedure\n* Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within the past 6 months\n* Cardiogenic shock\n* Acute or chronic renal dysfunction\n* Prior anaphylactic reaction to contrast agents\n* Leukopenia\n* Thrombocytopenia\n* Thrombocytosis\n* Active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding\n* Current treatment, or past-treatment within 12-months of the index procedure, with paclitaxel or other chemotherapeutic agents\n* Anticipated treatment with paclitaxel or oral rapamycin during any period in the 9-months after the index procedure\n* Known intention to procreate within 9 months after the index procedure\n* Positive pregnancy test within 7 days before the index procedure, or lactating\n* Life expectancy of less than 24 months due to other medical conditions\n* Co-morbid condition(s) that could limit subject's ability to comply with study follow-up requirements or impact study scientific integrity\n* Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study\n\nAngiographic Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Target Lesion\n\n  * Target lesion located in native coronary artery\n  * Target lesion must be de novo\n  * Target lesion diameter stenosis ≥ 50%\n  * Reference vessel diameter (RVD) ≥ 2.75 mm to ≤ 4.0 mm\n  * Cumulative target lesion length ≤ 28 mm (area to be treated may be composed of multiple lesions but must be completely coverable by one study stent)\n  * Target lesion is successfully pre-dilated\n* One non-target lesion may be treated in a non-target vessel as follows:\n\n  * Non-target lesion in non-target vessel must be treated with commercially available TAXUS stent if use of drug eluting stent required\n  * Treatment must be deemed a clinical angiographic success, without requiring use of unplanned additional stents(s)\n  * Treatment must be completed prior to treatment of target vessel\n\nAngiographic Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Target lesion located in left main artery, whether protected or unprotected\n* Target lesion is a chronic total occlusion (TIMI flow ≤ 1)\n* Target lesion is restenotic\n* Target lesion is located in a saphenous vein graft or mammary artery graft\n* Target lesion is accessed via saphenous vein graft or mammary artery graft\n* Target lesion is \\< 5 mm from bare metal stent (BMS)\n* Target lesion \\< 5 mm from ostium\n* Target lesion \\< 5 mm from side branch vessel ≥ 2.0 mm in diameter (Exceptions: subject may be enrolled if side branch is 100% occluded or if side branch is protected with a patent graft)\n* Untreated lesions with ≥ 50% diameter stenosis or thought to impair flow remaining in target vessel at a location with ≥ 2.0mm RVD\n* Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal to target lesion moderately or severely calcified\n* Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal to target lesion severely tortuous\n* Target lesion located within or distal to a \\> 60° bend in target vessel\n* Target vessel with angiographic presence of probable or definite thrombus\n* Unprotected left main coronary artery disease\n* Protected left main coronary artery disease with target lesion in Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD) or Left Circumflex artery (LCx).
