The goal of PROPPR is to improve the basis on which clinicians make decisions about transfusion protocols for massively bleeding patients.\n\nPROPPR is a Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Protocol. ROC is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the United States' Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defence Research and Development Canada. PROPPR will be conducted as a Phase III trial at Level I Adult Trauma Centers in North America.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"24-hour Mortality","timeFrame":"First 24 hours after ED admission","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1:1:1 Blood Transfusion Ratio","deltaMin":43,"sd":null},{"arm":"1:1:2 Blood Transfusion Ratio","deltaMin":58,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.12"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37058726","33797501","31050809","30447946","30030268","29766088","28930959","28731937","25647203","24996573","24335442"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":338},"commonTop":["Systemic inflammatory response syndrome","Infection","Sepsis","Acute Kidney Injury","Ventilator-associated pneumonia"]}}
