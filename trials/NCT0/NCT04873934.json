Statin intolerant participants are eligible if they had intolerable side effects on at least 2 different statins, including one at the lowest standard dose\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIb or IV heart failure or last known left ventricular ejection fraction \\<25%.\n* Significant cardiac arrhythmia within 3 months prior to randomization that is not controlled by medication or via ablation at the time of screening.\n* Severe concomitant non-cardiovascular disease that carries the risk of reducing life expectancy to less than 2 years.\n* Treatment with other investigational products or devices within 30 days or five half˗lives of the screening visit, whichever is longer.\n* Planned use of other investigational products or devices during the course of the study.\n* Treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed towards PCSK9 within 90 days of screening.\n* Recurrent ACS event within 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n* Coronary angiography and revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery) performed within 2 weeks prior to the randomization visit or planned after randomization.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100
