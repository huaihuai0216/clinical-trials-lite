This results in death or neurologic disabilities including cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment in up to half of affected infants. This clinical trial will determine if the drug erythropoietin (Epo) added to hypothermia (usual therapy) will improve outcomes for infants suffering from HIE.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Death or Neurodevelopmental Impairment","timeFrame":"Prior to final outcome assessment at 22-26 months of age; For extenuating circumstances, for example, COVID-19 restrictions, may be performed up to 36 months of age","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Erythropoietin","deltaMin":126,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":110,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29514165","33888528","34144032","35830641","38984984","38006967","37742617","37698478","37418263","37019334"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":137,"n":257},"commonTop":["Ever intubated","Acute liver injury","Thrombocytopenia","Seizure: clinical or electrographic","Hypotension warranting inotropes"]}}
