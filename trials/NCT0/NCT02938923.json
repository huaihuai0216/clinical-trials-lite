It will compare the effects of six months of supervised exercise training combined with daily topical testosterone gel, to six months of supervised exercise and inactive gel, and to Enhanced Usual Care. The randomization protocol is that for every nine participants randomized, 4 will be assigned to the topical testosterone gel and supervised exercise training group; 4 will be assigned to topical inactive gel and supervised exercise training group; and 1 will be assigned to the enhanced usual care group. All participants will receive nutritional counseling, and calcium and vitamin D supplements.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Six Minute Walk Distance","timeFrame":"Baseline to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Exercise + Testosterone (EX + T)","deltaMin":42.69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Exercise + Placebo (EX + P)","deltaMin":40.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)","deltaMin":37.65,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.853"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.767"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.868"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.960"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.630"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.657"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.627"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.364"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.574"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.557"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.302"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.541"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33716173","40372752","36070134"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":54},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Contusion","Urinary tract infection","Back pain","Pain in extremity"]}}
