The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving co-administration of ketamine and propofol will have a lower rate of adverse events, compared to patients receiving ketamine for procedural sedation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Frequency of Adverse Events","timeFrame":"From enrollment through completion of follow-up, up to 7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ketamine Alone","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ketamine Co-Administered With Propofol","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15930401","11097698","16132313","15936092","15896585","14617116","18091596","17059854","19224786","17142550","19026467","8001210","2367140"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":99},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Respiratory depression","Unpleasant recovery Reaction","Cardiovascular event"]}}
