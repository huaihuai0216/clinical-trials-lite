The study will enroll inadequately controlled patients by high doses (maximal approved) of first-generation somatostatin analogues given for at least 3 months. Patients will receive pasireotide LAR 40 mg or 60 mg during the 36 week core study phase. Patients who have completed all visits of core phase and have completed all the assessments at the core phase completion visit can move into the 32-week extension phase. Patients can continue with study treatment until pasireotide LAR is commercially available and reimbursed in their respective country or until the end of the extension phase whichever occurs first.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Core Phase: Percentage of Participants With Mean GH < 1 g/L and IGF-1 < ULN at Week 36 by Previous Treatment and Overall","timeFrame":"Week 36","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lanreotide 120 mg","deltaMin":14.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Octreotide 30 mg","deltaMin":13.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Octreotide 40 mg","deltaMin":15.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pasireotide LAR Overall","deltaMin":14.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","China","Colombia","France","Hungary","Italy","Malaysia","Mexico","Portugal","Romania","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32117045"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":92},"commonTop":["Hyperglycaemia","Diabetes mellitus","Diarrhoea","Headache","Anaemia"]}}
