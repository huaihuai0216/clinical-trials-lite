While there is a large body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of tiotropium in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), relatively little is known about its efficacy and safety in patients with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Therefore, Boehringer Ingelheim proposed to profile the long acting anticholinergic tiotropium and to generate adequate clinical data for use as a bronchodilator in paediatric and adult CF. The phase III trial (205.438) is a part of the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed for Spiriva® Respimat® in Cystic Fibrosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Area Under the Curve 0-4 Hours (AUC0-4h) Response","timeFrame":"30 minutes (min) before first dosing of study drug (defined as baseline), at 1 hour (h), 2 h , 3 h, and 4 h post dosing at day 1 and at 30 min before dosing, at 1 hour, 2 h , 3 h, and 4 h post dosing after 12 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.87,"sd":0.8},{"arm":"Tio R5 qd","deltaMin":2.51,"sd":0.57}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.092"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":99,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Slovakia","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25819269"],"seeAlso":["http://trials.boehringer-ingelheim.com/content/dam/internet/opu/clinicaltrial/com_EN/results/205/205.438_Literature.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":155},"commonTop":["Cough","Pyrexia","Nasopharyngitis","Bronchitis","Headache"]}}
