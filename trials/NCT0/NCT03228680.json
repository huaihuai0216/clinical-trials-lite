This also includes women who have been diagnosed with any of the above medical conditions but have had them surgically corrected within 1 year prior to screening.\n* Transvaginal ultrasound documenting presence and adequate visualization of both ovaries, without evidence of significant abnormality (e.g. no endometrioma greater than 3 cm or enlarged ovaries which would contraindicate the use of gonadotropins) and fallopian tubes and surrounding tissue without evidence of significant abnormality (e.g. no hydrosalpinx) within 1 year prior to screening. Both ovaries must be accessible for oocyte retrieval.\n* Early follicular phase (cycle day 2-4) serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) between 1 and 15 IU/L (results obtained within 3 months prior to screening).\n* Body mass index (BMI) between 17.5 and 32.0 kg/m\\^2 (both inclusive) at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known endometriosis stage III-IV (defined by the revised ASRM classification).\n* One or more follicles \\>10 mm (including cysts) observed on the transvaginal ultrasound prior to start of stimulation on stimulation day 1 (puncture of cysts prior randomization is allowed).\n* Known history of recurrent miscarriage (defined as three consecutive losses after ultrasound confirmation of pregnancy (excl. ectopic pregnancy) and before week 24 of pregnancy).\n* Known abnormal karyotype of participant or of her partner. In case the sperm production is severely impaired (concentration \\<1 million/mL), normal karyotype, including no Y chromosome microdeletion, must be documented.\n* Active arterial or venous thromboembolism or severe thrombophlebitis, or a history of these events.\n* Any known clinically significant systemic disease (e.g. insulin-dependent diabetes).\n* Any known endocrine or metabolic abnormalities (pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, liver or kidney) which can compromise participation in the trial with the exception of controlled thyroid function disease.\n* Known tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, adrenal gland, pituitary or hypothalamus which would contraindicate the use of gonadotropins.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Oocytes Retrieved","description":"The number of oocytes retrieved was recorded at the oocyte retrieval visit.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.3","spread":"5.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.5","spread":"6.1"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Clinical Pregnancy Rate","description":"Clinical pregnancy was defined as at least one gestational sac 5-6 weeks after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Positive Beta Unit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Beta-hCG) Rate","description":"Defined as positive serum beta-hCG test 13-15 days after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Vital Pregnancy Rate","description":"Vital pregnancy was defined as at least one intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat 5-6 weeks after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Implantation Rate","description":"Implantation rate was defined as the number of gestational sacs 5-6 weeks after transfer divided by the number of blastocysts transferred.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Participants With Cycle Cancellation Due to Poor or Excessive Ovarian Response","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Participants With Blastocyst Transfer Cancellation Due to Excessive Ovarian Response / OHSS Risk","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Participants With <4, 4-7, 8-14, 15-19 and ≥20 Oocytes Retrieved","description":"Defined as proportion of participants grouped according to the number of oocytes retrieved.
