Participants undergoing treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) must be on stable therapy for at least 8 weeks prior to consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known history of hypersensitivity reaction to any component of FCM.\n2. Previous randomization and treatment in this study or any other clinical study of FCM or VIT-45.\n3. History of acquired iron overload, hemochromatosis, or other iron accumulation disorders.\n4. Chronic kidney disease participants on hemodialysis.\n5. History of significant diseases of the liver, hematopoietic system, cardiovascular system, psychiatric disorder, or other conditions which, on the opinion of the investigator, may place a subject at added risk for participation in the study.\n6.
