Each domain is calculated separately and measured on a scale of 1-7 (1=maximum impairment; 7=no impairment). Dyspnea domain score is the mean of all non-missing responses for that domain. Only the dyspnea domain was measured as a secondary outcome. BL scores are the derived scores for each domain and total at Day 1 pre-dose.
