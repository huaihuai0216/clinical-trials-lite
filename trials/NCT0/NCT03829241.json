Participants must be physically able and expected to complete the trial as designed\n* Minimum of 6 years of education or equivalent to complete necessary scales and understand consent forms\n* Participants must be able to understand and agree to comply with the prescribed dosage regimens and procedures; report for regularly scheduled office visits; and reliably communicate with study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medications\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test prior to dosing at Baseline\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with a primary DSM-V psychiatric disorder diagnosis other than GAD within the past 6-months.
