We also hypothesize that SSRI will be effective in treating PTSD and depressive symptoms and naltrexone will be well tolerated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Self-report Weekly Craving Via Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)","timeFrame":"beginning of treatment (week 1), and end of treatment (13 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Paroxetine and Naltrexone","deltaMin":21.273,"sd":2.547},{"arm":"Paroxetine and Placebo","deltaMin":20.7,"sd":2.672},{"arm":"Desipramine and Naltrexone","deltaMin":18.5,"sd":2.547},{"arm":"Desipramine and Placebo","deltaMin":21.458,"sd":2.439}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22089316"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22089316"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":22},"commonTop":["Dizziness and Lightheadedness","Incarcerated for intoxication","Tachycardia","Suicidal Ideation"]}}
