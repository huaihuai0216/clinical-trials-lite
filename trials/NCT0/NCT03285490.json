Males and females greater than or equal to (\\>=) 18 years old.\n2. A defined area on the face or scalp contains 4 to 8 clinically typical, visible, and discrete AK lesions.\n3.

Females were postmenopausal (greater than \\[\\>\\] 45 years of age with at least 12 months of amenorrhea), surgically sterile (by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation); or, if of childbearing potential, were using highly effective contraception for at least 30 days or 1 menstrual cycle, whichever was longer, prior to study treatment and agreed to continue to use highly effective contraception for at least 30 days following their last dose of study treatment. Highly effective contraception includes oral hormonal contraceptives, hormonal contraceptive implant, injection or patch, intrauterine device or complete abstinence from sexual intercourse.\n5. Sexually active males who had not had a vasectomy, and whose partner was reproductively capable, must had agreed to use barrier contraception from Screening through 90 days after their last dose of study treatment.\n6.

A history of sensitivity and/or allergy to any of the ingredients in the study medication.\n10. A skin disease (e.g., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema) or condition (e.g., scarring, open wounds) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the study conduct or evaluations, or which exposes the participant to unacceptable risk by study participation.\n11. Other significant uncontrolled or unstable medical diseases or conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would expose the participant to unacceptable risk by study participation.\n12. Females who were pregnant or nursing.\n13. Participated in an investigational drug trial during which an investigational study medication was administered within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever was longer, before dosing.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Complete (100%) Clearance of Actinic Keratosis (AK) Lesions","description":"Complete clearance rate was defined as the percentage of participants at Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"54","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance Rate of Actinic Keratosis Lesions at Day 57","description":"Partial clearance rate of AK lesions was defined as the percentage of participants with a greater than or equal to (\\>=) 75% reduction in the number of AK lesions identified at Baseline (Day 1 predose) in the treatment area.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"76","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Change From Baseline in Actinic Keratosis Lesion Counts at Days 8, 15, 29 and 57","description":"Overall the change from baseline in lesion count at each visit were summarized and reported using descriptive statistics by treatment location (face or scalp).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Recurrence of Actinic Keratosis Lesions Who Achieved Complete Clearance at Day 57","description":"Recurrence rate was estimated based on Kaplan-Meier method, with recurrence define as appearance of any AK lesions in the treatment area, including those recurred or newly identified.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Maximal Post Baseline Local Skin Reaction (LSR)","description":"Maximal post baseline LSR was defined as the highest grade of any LSR reported at any post baseline visits for a participant.
