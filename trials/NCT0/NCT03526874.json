Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), injections of local anesthetics over branches of the occipital and/or trigeminal nerves, have been associated with possible benefit for pediatric headaches in case series, and may be useful for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine for children who fail less invasive treatments. In fact, 80% of pediatric headache specialists reported using peripheral nerve blocks and carry low risk of serious side effects; however, peripheral nerve blocks have never been tested, formally, in a randomized pediatric trial.\n\nBy applying a novel design that utilizes lidocaine cream as a run-in step, investigators intend to test the efficacy of the most commonly used peripheral nerve block, the greater occipital nerve (GON) block, as an acute treatment for pediatric migraine and determine whether lidocaine cream leads to successful blinding of the injection.\n\nThe GON block is expected to prove effective in decreasing the pain of migraine, with lidocaine being superior to saline and lidocaine cream maintaining blinding.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Pain Intensity Scores Measured by the Numeric Analog Scale (NRS)","timeFrame":"Pre-injection (*Baseline*) and 30 minutes Post-injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Greater Occipital Nerve (GON) Block With Lidocaine","deltaMin":2.3,"sd":1.9},{"arm":"Greater Occipital Nerve (GON) Block With Saline","deltaMin":1.1,"sd":1.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.013"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11739822","12837897","11279934","7950559","27731894","20554116","22384463"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":29},"commonTop":["Worse headache pain","Feeling dizzy","Feeling worried or panicky","Feeling sick to your stomach","Numbness"]}}
