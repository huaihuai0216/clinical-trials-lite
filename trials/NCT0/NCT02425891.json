The safety of single-agent nab-paclitaxel has been determined in previous studies of participants with mBC and the safety data to date suggest that atezolizumab can be safely combined with standard chemotherapy agents.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (v1.1) in All Randomized Participants","timeFrame":"Baseline up to approximately 34 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Plus Nab-Paclitaxel","deltaMin":5.49,"sd":null},{"arm":"Atezolizumab Plus Nab-Paclitaxel","deltaMin":7.16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0025"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":247,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Colombia","Costa Rica","Czechia","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Mexico","Norway","Panama","Poland","Romania","Russia","Singapore","Slovenia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35695609","33579739","32178964","31786121","30345906"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":80,"n":430},"commonTop":["ALOPECIA","FATIGUE","NAUSEA","DIARRHOEA","ANAEMIA"]}}
