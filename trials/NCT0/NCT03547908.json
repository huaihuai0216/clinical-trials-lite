This report will be provided by Gilead Sciences. Alternatively, if genotype results from a local laboratory obtained ≤ 90 days prior to screening visit date show sensitivity to these drugs, this genotype will be acceptable to fulfill this inclusion criterion in the event that the genotype obtained at screening is not yet available and all other inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed\n* HBV co-infection:\n\n  * Must be hepatitis B virus (HBV) treatment naive (defined as \\< 12 weeks of oral antiviral treatment)\n  * Screening HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ≥ 2000 IU/mL\n* Hepatic transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) ≤ 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and HCV RNA detectable\n* Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding) or with Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) C impairment\n* Current alcohol or substance use judged by the Investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 and HBV infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1\n* Participation in any other clinical trial, including observational studies, without prior approval from the sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL at Week 48 as Defined by the US FDA-Defined Snapshot Algorithm (Co-primary Endpoint)","description":"The percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA \\< 50 copies/mL at Week 48 was analyzed using the snapshot algorithm, which defines a participant's virologic response status using only the viral load at the predefined time point within an allowed window of time, along with study drug discontinuation status.
