Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine, daunorubicin hydrochloride, cytarabine, and decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Assessed every 3 months for 4 years and then every 6 months for 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A (Step 1:Daunorubicin/Cytarabine; Step 2:Cytarabine; Step 3: Observation/Decitabine/Transplant)","deltaMin":12.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"B (Step 1: Clofarabine; Step 2: Clofarabine; Step 3: Observation/Decitabine/Transplant)","deltaMin":11.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":34},"locations":{"siteCount":269,"countries":["United States","India","Israel"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":354,"n":356},"commonTop":["Anemia","Platelet count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
