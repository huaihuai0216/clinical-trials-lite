Progression free survival was censored if no PFS event was observed before the first to occur out of (i) the cut-off date, or (ii) the date when a further anticancer therapy was started. The censoring date was the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before either of these two events occurred. If a PFS event was observed after two or more missing or non-evaluable tumor assessments, then the date of progression was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment; for a PFS event observed after a single missing or non-evaluable tumor assessment, the actual date of disease progression was used.

The QLQ-C30 has five function scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting) and a global health status/quality of life scale. In addition, there are questions that assess specific symptoms. The QLQ-STO22 consists of 22 questions that make up five multi-item scales (dysphagia, pain, reflux, eating and anxiety) and four single-item scales (dry mouth, tasting, body image and hair loss).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.51","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.45","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.35","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.15","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.87","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.87","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.84","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.71","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Definitive Deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) Score","description":"The ECOG PS scale was used to classify patients according to their functional impairment, with scores ranging from 0 (fully active) to 5 (dead). An analysis of the time to definitive deterioration of the ECOG PS by one category of the score from baseline was performed. Definitive deterioration was defined as a definitive increase by one category from baseline in ECOG PS, with no later improvements observed during the course of the study. A single measure reporting an increase in ECOG PS is sufficient to consider it as a definitive worsening only if it was the last one available for the patient. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the distribution function of time to definitive worsening.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.23","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Response Rate (ORR)","description":"ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with measurable disease in whom best overall response (OR) was either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST criteria.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"379","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"191","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Everolimus Steady State Concentraions at Predose (Cmin) and Cmax at Week 5","description":"Cmin is the minimum (trough) steady-state drug concentration in the blood during multiple dosing and Cmax is the maximum (peak) blood drug concentration after dose administration.
