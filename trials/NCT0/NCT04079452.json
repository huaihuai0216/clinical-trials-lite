It functions by inhibiting viral replication of both wild-type virus and most common NNRTI variants. It is dosed orally once daily and always given in combination with other HIV-1 active agents as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Initial pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated not extensive binding to plasma proteins, which may be crucial determinant for penetration to different reservoirs such as the central nervous system (CNS). This study will address two important issues: The pharmacokinetic profile of Doravirine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as the maintenance of HIV suppression in CSF. The assessment of concentrations as well as the antiviral activity of new antiretroviral drugs in compartments such as CNS is relevant to avoid HIV-related neurocognitive disorders as well as for future cure strategies. In addition, the role of unbound ARV drug concentrations has been scarcely evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Doravirine Concentrations in Cerebrospinal Fluid","timeFrame":"4 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Doravirine+TAF/FTC Arm (Single Arm)","deltaMin":58.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Thoracic pain"]}}
