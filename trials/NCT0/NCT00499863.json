Subject has a current, controlled (requiring a restricted medication) or uncontrolled, with significant symptoms such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, psychosis, bipolar illness, pervasive developmental disorder, severe obsessive compulsive disorder, severe depressive or severe anxiety disorder.\n2.

Subject has any abnormal thyroid function.\n10. Subject has any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.\n11. Subject has severe allergic rhinitis, disability, or other condition that might confound the results of safety assessments administered in the study or that might increase risk to the subject. Mild, stable asthma is not exclusionary.\n12. The female subject is pregnant or lactating.\n13. Subject has any skin disease, or history of any chronic skin disease, skin cancer, skin manifestations of allergic disease, or other dermatologic conditions which would interfere with trial assessments or compromise subject safety (e.g. dermatitis, eczema or psoriasis).\n14. Subject has sensitive-skin syndrome (definition: subjects who often develop nonspecific skin irritancy reactions to bland materials) or has sensitivities to the ingredients in soaps, lotions, cosmetics or adhesives.\n15.
