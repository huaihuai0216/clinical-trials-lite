The PANSS total score is rated based on a structured clinical interview with the patient and supporting clinical information obtained from family, hospital staff, or other reliable informants. This assessment provides scores in 9 clinical domains, including a positive syndrome, a negative syndrome, depression, a composite index, and general psychopathology. Each item is scored on a 7-point (1 to 7) scale, with 1 being minimal impact, and 7 being highest impact. The cumulative score ranges from 30 to 210. A negative change score indicates improvement.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-16.0","spread":"1.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-22.8","spread":"1.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-25.9","spread":"1.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Measurement of Schizophrenia Symptoms: Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S)","description":"The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale is a clinician-rated scale that measures the overall severity of a participant's illness in comparison with the severity of illness in other participants the physician has observed.
