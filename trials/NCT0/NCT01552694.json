They need safe and effective treatments that reduce the risk for developing diabetes and heart disease, and improve their quality of life. This project will explore whether a new anti-diabetes medication (Januvia) with a novel mechanism of action reduces inflammation, and improves blood vessel function in HIV infected men and women with several risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Inflammatory Biomarker 1: Plasma hsCRP Concentration","timeFrame":"2 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":3.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":5.4,"sd":4.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25938633"],"seeAlso":["https://ccs.wustl.edu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":["Fatique, Fever, Chills, Loss of appetite, Weight Loss","Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, hypoglycemia","muscle ache, arthritis, swelling, weakness","headaches, dizziness ,numbness, depression, anxiety, confusion","Chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing, cough"]}}
