Note: Continued use of an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control is recommended for 30 days after study completion.\n* Subject is judged by the investigator to be suitable for participation in a 12 month clinical trial involving open-label dasotraline treatment.\n* Subject can read well enough to understand the informed consent form and other subject materials.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject is considered by the investigator to be at imminent risk of suicide, injury to self or to others, or damage to property.\n* Subject is considered a suicide risk in the investigator's opinion or has any previous history of suicide attempt within the past 12 months.\n* Subject answers \"yes\" to \"suicidal ideation\" item 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or item 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) on the C SSRS assessment at OL Baseline. Subjects who answer \"yes\" to this question must be referred to the Investigator for follow up evaluation.\n* Subject has a clinically significant abnormality including physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or laboratory tests that the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor considers to be inappropriate to allow participation in the study.\n* Subject has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) or breath alcohol test at OL Baseline.\n* Subject is breastfeeding.\n* Subject is at high risk of non-compliance in the investigator's opinion.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"56 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Frequency and Severity of Suicidal Ideation Using the Columbia-suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)","description":"Columbia-suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) Severity of suicidal ideation is rated on a 6-point scale from 0='No ideation present' to 5='Active ideation with plan and intent'.
