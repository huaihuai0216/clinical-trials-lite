An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. Adverse Events of Interest (AEI) for PK analyses included: headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, appetite disorders, sleep disorders, angioedema, psychiatric disorders (anxiety, nervousness), psychiatric disorders (depression,suicidal ideation,behaviour) and weight loss.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.611","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.647","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.436","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.647","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.408","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.600","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.626","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.600","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.929","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.611","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.08","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Median Simulated Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events of Interest","description":"The PK model predicted the total PDE4 inhibitory activity and the median simulated percentage of participants with Adverse Events of Interest during 12 weeks of treatment based on 1000 participants simulated.
