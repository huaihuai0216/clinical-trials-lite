The impact of ITP on Physical Health consists of four sub-scales, which evaluate ITP related Symptoms, Fatigue, Bother and Activity. The impact of ITP on Mental Health consists of two sub-scales, which evaluate Psychological distress and Fear in a population with ITP. Items are scored from 0-100 with higher scores indicating better HRQOL.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.20","spread":"13.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.99","spread":"16.00"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.43","spread":"17.39"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.23","spread":"21.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.01","spread":"15.81"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.48","spread":"12.59"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.32","spread":"19.65"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.89","spread":"13.41"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.51","spread":"16.35"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.78","spread":"14.54"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 (SF-36)","description":"The SF-36 is a widely used generic health-related quality of life measure.

The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension comprises three levels (no problems, some/moderate problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions.
