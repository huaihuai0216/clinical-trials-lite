CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Histologically confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast\n\n  * Confined to the breast and ipsilateral axilla on clinical exam\n\n    * Stage I, II, or IIIA (cT1-3, N0-1, M0)\n* At least one axillary lymph node with evidence of tumor on histologic exam\n\n  * Sentinel node biopsy allowed if followed by axillary dissection\n  * No suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes, unless proven on biopsy to not be involved with tumor\n* No bilateral malignancy or mass in the opposite breast, unless mass is histologically proven to be benign\n* Must have undergone either a prior total mastectomy and axillary dissection (modified radical mastectomy) OR\n* Prior lumpectomy and axillary dissection\n\n  * Patients must receive radiotherapy after randomization (not before) AND after chemotherapy\n  * Margins must be clear\n  * No ipsilateral lymph nodes that are fixed to one another or to other structures (N2 disease) and/or any positive nonaxillary lymph nodes (intramammary nodes are considered axillary nodes)\n  * No histologically evident invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ\n  * No diffuse tumors by mammography that would not be surgically amenable to lumpectomy\n  * No other dominant mass in the ipsilateral breast remnant unless one of the following is true:\n\n    * Histologically benign\n    * Surgically removed with clear margins if malignant\n* No ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or underlying chest wall (complete fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude\n\n  * Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion allowed\n* No metastatic disease\n\n  * Skeletal pain allowed if bone scan negative for metastases\n* Hormone receptor status:\n\n  * Estrogen and progesterone status determined\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\nAge:\n\n* greater than or equal to 18 years\n\nSex:\n\n* Female\n\nMenopausal status:\n\n* Not specified\n\nPerformance status:\n\n* Not specified\n\nLife expectancy:\n\n* At least 10 years, excluding diagnosis of cancer\n\nHematopoietic:\n\n* Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm\\^3 (may be less, if in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variation)\n* Platelet count at least 100,000/mm\\^3\\* NOTE: \\*If platelet count is above the upper limit of normal (ULN), significant underlying hematologic disorders must be excluded\n\nHepatic:\n\n* Bilirubin no greater than ULN\n* Alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 times ULN\\*\n* SGOT less than 1.5 times ULN\\*\n* No nonmalignant systemic hepatic disease that would preclude study participation NOTE: \\*Alkaline phosphatase and SGOT cannot both be greater than ULN\n\nRenal:\n\n* Creatinine no greater than normal\n* No nonmalignant systemic renal disease that would preclude study participation\n\nCardiovascular:\n\n* No nonmalignant systemic cardiovascular disease that would preclude study participation\n* LVEF at least lower limit of normal (LLN) by MUGA or echocardiogram\n* No active cardiac disease that would preclude use of doxorubicin or docetaxel, including the following:\n\n  * Any prior myocardial infarction\n  * Angina pectoris requiring anti-anginal medication\n  * History of congestive heart failure\n  * Cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication\n  * Severe conduction abnormality\n  * Valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise\n  * Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray or ventricular hypertrophy on EKG, unless LVEF at least LLN\n  * Poorly controlled hypertension (diastolic greater than 100 mm/Hg)\n  * Hypertension well controlled by medication allowed\n\nOther:\n\n* No grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy\n* No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years except:\n\n  * Effectively treated squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer\n  * Surgically treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n  * Segmentally resected lobular carcinoma in situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast\n* Not pregnant or nursing\n* Negative pregnancy test\n* Fertile patients must use effective barrier contraception\n* No nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude study participation\n* No diabetes with morning fasting blood glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater\n* No psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude informed consent\n* No contraindication to corticosteroids that would preclude study participation\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\nBiologic therapy:\n\n* No prior immunotherapy for breast cancer\n\nChemotherapy:\n\n* No prior chemotherapy for breast cancer\n* No prior anthracyclines or taxanes\n* No other concurrent investigational chemotherapy\n\nEndocrine therapy:\n\n* No prior hormonal therapy for breast cancer\n* No concurrent hormonal birth control methods or other hormonal therapy\n* No concurrent raloxifene, including for osteoporosis\n* Concurrent low-dose topical estrogen in the form of conjugated estrogen ring or conjugated estrogen vaginal cream (dose no more than 0.3 mg or 1/8 of an applicator applied vaginally 3 times a week) allowed\n\nRadiotherapy:\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* No prior radiotherapy for this malignancy\n\nSurgery:\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* No more than 84 days since prior surgery for breast cancer (e.g., lumpectomy, mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, axillary dissection, or re-excision of lumpectomy margins)\n\nOther:\n\n* No prior systemic therapy for this malignancy\n* No concurrent medications that alter cardiac conduction (e.g., digitalis, beta blockers, or calcium-channel blockers) for cardiac arrhythmia, angina, or congestive heart failure (allowed if administered for other reasons \\[e.g., hypertension\\])\n* Concurrent bisphosphonates allowed","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"120
