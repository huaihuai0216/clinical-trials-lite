The CAS, which is based on classical signs of inflammation (pain, redness, and swelling), consists of 7 equally weighted items. The total CAS (as used in this study) may range from 0 to 7. The higher the CAS, the greater degree of inflammation is present. A drop in CAS of 2 or more points suggests an improvement in the inflammatory components of the disease. A CAS ≥3 implies active disease.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.2","spread":"2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.5","spread":"1.8"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Failure Rate","description":"The failure rate was defined as a composite variable of CAS decrease of \\< 2 points or need for additional therapy (excluding cosmetic surgery) for the eye disease.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"69","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"75","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"50","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Disease Severity","description":"Disease severity was measured by the NOSPECS Score.

It is usually the result of impaired function of the extraocular muscles, where both eyes are still functional but they cannot converge to target the desired object.\n\nThe Gorman diplopia score includes four categories: 1) no diplopia (absent), 2) diplopia when the patient is tired or awakening (intermittent), 3) diplopia at extremes of gaze (inconstant), and 4) continuous diplopia in the primary or reading position (constant).","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Graves' Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life Score Using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey","description":"Quality of life (QoL) was measured by the SF-12 questionnaire.
