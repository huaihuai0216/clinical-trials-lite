This disease has proven to be difficult to treat. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that depletes a line of cells involved in the autoimmune response. The study hypotheses is that rituximab is effective in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe active Graves' ophthalmopathy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Clinical Activity Score (CAS)","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 months after the first infusion","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab","deltaMin":-1.2,"sd":2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.5,"sd":1.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.73"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25343233"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":13},"commonTop":["Myalgia","Rash on face","Acute Bronchitis","Vasculitis legs","Significant eye tearing"]}}
