The DLQI is a skin disease-specific questionnaire aimed at the evaluation of how symptoms and treatment affect patients' health related quality of life (HRQoL), with a recall period of 7 days. This instrument asks participants 10 questions about symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. The scoring of each answer for the DLQI is on a scale range of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The DLQI total score was calculated by adding the score of each question. The maximum score is 30, and the minimum score is 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.
