of any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the study dosing\n* Participation in any other clinical trial without prior approval from sponsor is prohibited while participating in this trial\n* Receiving ongoing therapy with any disallowed medications, including drugs not to be used with EVG, COBI, FTC, TDF or individuals with any known allergies to the excipients of EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF STR tablets\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"17
