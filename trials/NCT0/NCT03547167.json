Increased risk for pneumococcal disease is defined as 1) an underlying medical condition, 2) behavioral habits such as smoking or alcohol use, or 3) living in a community/environment with increased risk of disease transmission.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Solicited Injection-site Adverse Events Following V114 or Prevnar 13™","timeFrame":"Up to 5 days after Vaccination 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V114","deltaMin":15.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevnar 13™","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Chile","New Zealand","Poland","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35146039"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":49,"n":1134},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Fatigue","Myalgia","Injection site swelling","Headache"]}}
