form, which must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures\n* Currently receiving antiretroviral regimen containing FTC/TDF in combination with one third agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening.\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \\< 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay) and not experienced two consecutive HIV-1 RNA above detectable levels after achieving a confirmed (two consecutive) HIV-1 RNA below detectable levels on the current regimen in the past year.\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA should be \\< 50 copies/mL at the screening visit.\n* Normal electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula for creatinine clearance\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 × the upper limit of the normal range (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin (individuals with documented Gilbert's syndrome or with Atazanavir-associated hyperbilirubinemia may have total bilirubin up to 5 x ULN)\n* Adequate hematologic function\n* Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN\n* Females of childbearing potential must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be non-heterosexually active, or practice abstinence from screening throughout the duration of the study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of the study drug.\n* Females who have stopped menstruating for ≥ 12 months but do not have documentation of ovarian hormonal failure must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level at screening within the post-menopausal range based on the Central Laboratory reference range.\n* Females who utilize hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing.\n* Males must agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual intercourse or be non-heterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence from first dose throughout the study period and for 30 days following the last study drug dose.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening\n* Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive and HCV RNA detectable\n* Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy, etc.)\n* Individuals receiving ongoing treatment with bisphosphonate to treat bone disease (eg, osteoporosis)\n* Females who are breastfeeding\n* Positive serum pregnancy test\n* Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Current alcohol or substance use judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance\n* A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma.\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 Visit\n* Individuals receiving ongoing therapy with any of the medications not to be used with FTC, TAF, TDF or other antiretroviral third agents.\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
