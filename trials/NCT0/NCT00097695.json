The VAS is a scale used to measure intensity of each symptom of the attack at baseline and at the pre-determined time points throughout treatment period. It consists of a horizontal 10cm line, with the 0 point corresponding to a state where patient experiences no symptoms at all and the 10cm point represents the worst symptoms ever experienced by patient. The patient indicates his/her current state of symptoms by drawing a mark across the horizontal line. TOSR was defined as the time between time of injection to time of first documented onset of symptom relief for the 3 primary symptoms: cutaneous swelling, cutaneous skin, and abdominal pain. The primary symptom was based on the type of attack. For abdominal attacks, the single primary symptom was abdominal pain. For cutaneous attacks, the single primary symptom was either skin swelling or skin pain, whichever was most severe.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Regression (Start of Improvement) According to Patient","description":"This parameter assessed the time to regression (start of improvement) of observable(visible) symptoms according to the patients.
