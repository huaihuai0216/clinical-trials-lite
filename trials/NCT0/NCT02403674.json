The primary hypothesis is that doravirine, tenofovir, lamivudine q.d. is non-inferior to ATRIPLA™ q.d. as assessed by the proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\<50 copies/mL (by the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay) at Week 48. This study has a total duration of 384 weeks, including a 96-week double-blind period and an additional 288-week open-label period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MK-1439A (DOR/3TC/TDF From Day 1)","deltaMin":84.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"ATRIPLA™ (Switch From EFV/FTC/TDF at Week 96)","deltaMin":80.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["40672760","39748155","38141637","33336698","31121015","31121013","30184165"],"seeAlso":["http://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26049&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":364},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
