However, EN alone is often associated with insufficient energy intakes and increased complication rates. Recently the investigators proposed to decrease this deficit by combining EN and supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN) whenever EN is insufficient (\\< 60% of their predicted energy needs) at day 3 after admission in the ICU.\n\nObjective: This study aims at: a/ investigating if the delivery of optimal nutrition support (100 % of predicted energy targets) in ICU patients by the combined administration of SPN and EN optimizes their clinical outcome; b/ implementing the new ICU nutrition guidelines.\n\nStudy design: Prospective, controlled, randomized clinical study.\n\nStudy site: Service of Intensive Care, Geneva University Hospital.\n\nPatient population: 220 ICU patients to be included: expected length of stay \\> 5 days, expected survival \\> 7 days, no contraindication to EN, obtained informed consent from themselves or their next of keen.\n\nExclusion criteria: refusal of consent, age \\< 18 years, short bowel syndrome, significant persistent gastrointestinal dysfunction with ileus, high output proximal fistula (\\> 1,5 liter/d), patients receiving PN.\n\nNutrition: At day 3 after admission, if energy input is \\< 60%; patients are randomized into either the \"Control group\" (EN alone) or the \"SPN group\" (EN + PN) to reach 100% of their predicted energy needs. Tight glycaemic control (target 6.0 to 8.3 mmol/l) to be achieved according to our local practice by insulin administration.\n\nStudy endpoints:\n\n* Primary: nosocomial infections (CDC criteria)\n* Secondary: Mechanical ventilation duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, antibiotic free days, ICU complications (extra-renal epuration, neurological, cardiac and respiratory complications), energy and protein balance, 28 days clinical outcome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Documented Infection Rate","timeFrame":"20 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control gr","deltaMin":58,"sd":null},{"arm":"SPN Group","deltaMin":41,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17468845","23218813"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":152},"commonTop":[]}}
