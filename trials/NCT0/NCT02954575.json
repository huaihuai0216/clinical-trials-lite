Severe hemophilia A (\\<1% FVIII:C) according to medical history\n2. Male patients aged ≥12 years\n3. Previous treatment with a FVIII concentrate for at least 150 exposure days (EDs)\n4. Immunocompetence (CD4+ count \\>200/µL)\n5. Good documentation of the historical bleeding rate (at least for the 6 months preceding study start)\n6. Voluntarily given, fully informed written and signed consent obtained by the patient (or parent/legal guardian in case of adolescents) before any study-related procedures are conducted\n\nWhenever possible, the interval between the Screening Visit and the PK or Non-PK Visit should not exceed 30 days. If the 30-day interval is exceeded, determination of the CD4+ count is to be repeated and must be \\>200/µL for patients to be enrolled (i.e., exclusion criterion no. 4).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any coagulation disorders other than hemophilia A\n2. History of FVIII inhibitor activity (≥0.6 BU) or detectable FVIII inhibitory anti-bodies (≥0.6 BU using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay) at screening, as determined by the central laboratory\n3. Severe liver or kidney diseases (alanine aminotransferase \\[ALAT\\] and aspartate transaminase \\[ASAT\\] levels \\>5 times of upper limit of normal, creatinine\\>120 µmol/L)\n4. Patients receiving or scheduled to receive immunomodulating drugs (other than anti-retroviral chemotherapy) such as alpha-interferon, prednisone (equivalent to \\>10 mg/day), or similar drugs\n5.
