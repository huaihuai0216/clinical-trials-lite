Willing and able to provide written informed consent.\n9. Willing and able to attend all study visits and adhere to all study assessments and procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Severe comorbidities including unstable cardiac or pulmonary disease or any other medical conditions that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the subject from safely completing the required tests or the study, or is likely to result in disease progression that would require withdrawal of the subject.\n2. Concomitant clinically significant respiratory disease other than COPD (eg, asthma, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis or other non-specific pulmonary disease).\n3.

Use of systemic steroids within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).\n7. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated within the past 5 years, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.\n8. Prolonged QTc (\\> 450 msec for males and \\> 470 msec for females) during Screening (Visit 1), or history of long QT syndrome.\n9. History of or clinically significant ongoing bladder outflow obstruction or history of catheterization for relief of bladder outflow obstruction within the previous 6 months.\n10. History of narrow angle glaucoma.\n11. History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to aerosol medications.\n12. Recent documented history (within the previous 3 months) of substance abuse.\n13. Significant psychiatric disease that would likely result in the subject not being able to complete the study, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n14. Participation in another investigational drug study where drug was received within 30 days prior to Screening (Visit 1) or current participation in another investigational drug trial, including a SUN-101 study.\n15. Previously received SUN-101 (active treatment; formerly known as EP-101).\n16. Contraindicated for treatment with, or having a history of reactions/ hypersensitivity to anticholinergic agents, beta2 agonists, or sympathomimetic amines.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)","description":"A TEAE is any adverse event (AE) that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication, any AE with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, or any AE with both a missing start and stop date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"430","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"312","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events","description":"A TEAE is any adverse event (AE) that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication, any AE with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, or any AE with both a missing start and stop date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"69.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"67.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAE)","description":"A treatment emergent serious adverse event (SAE) is any SAE that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication, any SAE with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, or any SAE with both a missing start and stop date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"49","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse","description":"A treatment emergent serious adverse event (SAE) is any SAE that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication, any SAE with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, or any SAE with both a missing start and stop date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Who Discontinue the Study Due to TEAE","description":"A TEAE is any adverse event (AE) that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication, any AE with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, or any AE with both a missing start and stop date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"62","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects Who Discontinue the Study Due to TEAE","description":"A TEAE is any adverse event (AE) that occurred on or after the first dose of study medication, any AE with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, or any AE with both a missing start and stop date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), Including Cardiovascular Death, Ischemia/Infarction, and Stroke","description":"All deaths and any other findings suggestive of a potential MACE (including clinically relevant information and SAEs, and all PTs form the SMQs \"myocardial infarction\", \"other ischemic heart disease\", \"central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions\") were sent to an adjudication committee for review and categorized as CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke.
