The investigators' hypothesis is that the use of a tranexamic acid-containing cardiac bath prior to chest closure will result in a statistically significant reduction in blood loss and transfusion requirements in patients who undergo CABG.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Volume of Blood Loss From Mediastinal Chest Tubes at Time of Removal (Assuming the Total Volume of Loss is Blood).","timeFrame":"From ICU admission post-operatively to mediastinal chest tube removal (placebo group = 20.6 hours; trial group = 19.8 hours)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trial Drug","deltaMin":632,"sd":265},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":789,"sd":216}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0493"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["19247741","16438759","17218108","10694619","19538741"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":[]}}
