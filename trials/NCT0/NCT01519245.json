Measurement of chest tube output began immediately on arrival to the ICU. Hourly measurements were recorded. Data collection ended upon chest tube removal, or return to the operating room for exploratory surgery due to massive blood loss. As per ICU protocol, chest tubes were be removed when blood loss was recorded to be less than 200mL after six consecutive hours.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"632","spread":"265"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"789","spread":"216"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Units of Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBC) Transfused Following Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery","description":"Research participants were to receive a blood transfusion in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) post-operatively if hemoglobin reached a nadir of 80g/L, or at the discretion of the intensivist or cardiac surgeon according to patient clinical status. Transfusion was quantified based on the number of units of PRBC received. (1 unit = 1 bag of blood, as prepared by Canadian Blood Services). Clinical status of research participants was followed throughout their duration in the ICU only. Participation in this study ended upon transfer out of the ICU, to the Cardiology Ward.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Volume of Blood Loss at 6 Hours","description":"Volume of chest tube loss at 6 hours (assuming the total volume of loss is blood).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"342","spread":"191"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"417","spread":"163"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Volume of Blood Loss After 12 Hours","description":"Volume of chest tube loss at 12 hours (assuming the total volume of loss is blood).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"464","spread":"222"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"570","spread":"157"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":[]}}}
