Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving immunotherapy with stereotactic body radiation therapy may work better than immunotherapy alone in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival (PFS) After Completion of First Line Standard of Care Systemic Therapy","timeFrame":"Up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy/Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2 Pembrolizumab Only","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":4},"commonTop":["Alanine aminotransferase increased","Hypertension","Lymphocyte count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Anemia"]}}
