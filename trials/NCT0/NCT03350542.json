trial that has not reached its primary endpoint\n* Subject intends to participate in another investigational drug or device clinical trial within 12 months after the index procedure\n* Subject with known intention to procreate within 12 months after the index procedure (women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use a reliable method of contraception from the time of screening through 12 months after the index procedure)\n* Subject is a woman who is pregnant or nursing Angiographic Exclusion Criteria (visual estimate)\n* Subject has more than 1 target lesion, or more than 1 target lesion and 1 non-target lesion, which will be treated during the index procedure Note: Multiple focal stenoses will be considered as a single lesion if they can be completely covered with 1 study stent\n* Treatment of lesions in more than 2 major epicardial vessels Note: 1 target lesion in the target vessel and 1 non-target lesion in non-target vessel is allowed\n* Subject has unprotected left main coronary artery disease (\\>50% diameter stenosis)\n* Subject has been treated with any type of PCI (i.e., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon atherectomy) within 24 hours prior to the index procedure\n* Thrombus, or possible thrombus, present in the target vessel (by visual estimate)\n* Target lesion meets any of the following criteria:\n* Treatment of a single lesion with more than 1 stent\n* Left main location\n* Lesion is located within 3 mm of the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery or left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery by visual estimate\n* Lesion is located within a saphenous vein graft or an arterial graft\n* Lesion will be accessed via a saphenous vein graft or arterial graft\n* Lesion with a TIMI flow 0 (total occlusion) or TIMI flow 1 prior to guide wire crossing\n* Lesion treated during the index procedure that involves a complex bifurcation (e.g., bifurcation lesion requiring treatment with more than 1 stent)\n* Lesion is restenotic from a previous stent implantation or study stent would overlap with a previous stent\n* Non-target lesion meets any of the following criteria:\n* Located within the target vessel\n* Left main location\n* Lesion is located within a saphenous vein graft or an arterial graft\n* Lesion with a TIMI flow 0 (total occlusion) or TIMI flow 1 prior to guide wire crossing\n* Lesion treated during the index procedure that involves a complex bifurcation (e.g., bifurcation lesion requiring treatment with more than 1 stent)\n* Requires additional unplanned stents (treatment of the non-target lesion with more than one stent is permitted as long as the stents are initially planned)\n* Treatment not deemed an angiographic success Note: Angiographic success is a mean lesion diameter stenosis \\< 50% (\\< 30% for stents) in 2 near-orthogonal projections with TIMI 3 flow, as visually assessed by the physician, without the occurrence of prolonged chest pain or ECG changes consistent with MI.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
