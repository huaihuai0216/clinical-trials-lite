Saxagliptin is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor whose mechanism of action is to prolong the duration of blood glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels by inhibiting their degradation and thereby augmenting insulin secretion. This study will serve as a pilot investigation to open perspectives for future studies to explore the potential of combining anti-diabetic drugs with different mechanisms of action in in patients with PCOS and impaired glucose regulation (IGR), especially ones for whom standard treatment with metformin is less effective.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Glucose Metabolism","timeFrame":"16 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin XR","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Saxagliptin","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Saxagliptin-Metformin XR","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":".007"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28228317"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":["Diarrhea"]}}
