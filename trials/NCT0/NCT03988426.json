Exposure to blood or any blood product or plasma derivatives, other than IVIG treatment of PI, within the past 3 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.\n5. Ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions to blood or plasma derived products, or any component of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) (such as Polysorbate 80).\n6. History of malignancies of lymphoid cells and immunodeficiency with lymphoma.\n7. Severe liver function impairment (ALAT 3 times above upper limit of normal).\n8. Known protein-losing enteropathies or proteinuria.\n9. Presence of renal function impairment (creatinine \\>120 µM/L or creatinine \\>1.35 mg/dL), or predisposition for acute renal failure (e.g., any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency or routine treatment with known nephritic drugs).\n10. Treatment with enteral or parenteral steroids for ≥30 days or when given intermittently or as bolus, at daily doses ≥0.15 mg/kg. Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n11. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) stage Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) III or IV.\n12. Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.\n13. Live viral vaccination (such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella) within the last 2 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.\n14. Treatment with any IMP within 3 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.\n15. Presence of any condition that is likely to interfere with the evaluation of study medication or satisfactory conduct of the trial.\n16. Known or suspected to abuse alcohol, drugs, psychotropic agents or other chemicals within the past 12 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.\n17. Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n18.
