months prior to the first vaccine dose.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within three months prior to the first vaccine dose or planned administration during the study period.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical.\n* Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History
