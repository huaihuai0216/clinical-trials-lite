Trial-related activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial, including activities to determine suitability for the trial.\n* Male or female.\n* Age above or equal to 18 years at the time of signing informed consent.\n* Diagnosed with T2D greater than or equal to 180 days prior to the day of screening.\n* HbA1c above 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) as measured by central lab.\n* Insulin na√Øve. However, short term insulin treatment for a maximum of 14 days prior to the day of screening is allowed, as is prior insulin treatment for gestational diabetes.\n* Stable daily dose(s) greater than or equal to 90 days prior to the day of screening of any of the following antidiabetic drug(s) or combination regimen(s): a .Any metformin formulations greater than or equal to 1500 mg or maximum tolerated or effective dose. b .Any metformin combination formulations greater than or equal to 1500 mg or maximum tolerated or effective dose. c. Any of the following non-insulin antidiabetic drug classes including combinations (greater than or equal to half of the maximum approved dose according to local label or maximum tolerated or effective dose):i). Sulfonylureas ii). Meglitinides (glinides) iii). DPP-4 inhibitors iv. SGLT2 inhibitors v). Thiazolidinediones vi). Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors vii).

Participation is defined as signed informed consent.\n* Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of child-bearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local regulation or practice).\n* Participation in any clinical trial of an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product within 30 days before screening. (Simultaneous participation in a trial with the primary objective of evaluating an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 disease or postinfectious conditions is allowed if the last dose of the investigational medicinal product has been received more than 30 days before screening)\n* Any disorder which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","description":"Change in HbA1c from baseline (week 0) to week 52 is presented.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.68","spread":"0.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.31","spread":"0.12"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time From Baseline to Treatment Discontinuation or Intensification","description":"Time from baseline to treatment discontinuation or intensification from baseline (week 0) to week 52 is presented.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQs) in Total Treatment Satisfaction","description":"Change in DTSQs in total treatment satisfaction is presented.
