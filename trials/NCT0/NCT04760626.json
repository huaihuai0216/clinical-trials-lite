Participants will either get insulin icodec, that participants will have to inject once a week on the same day of the week, or a marketed insulin, that participants will have to inject once a day. Which treatment participants get is decided at random.\n\nThe insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm or stomach.\n\nParticipants will measure their blood sugar every day. Participants will get a study phone to record safety data in the electronic diary (eDiary). If participants get a daily insulin they will record their insulin doses in the eDiary. If Participants get weekly insulin icodec, participants study phone will also have the DoseGuide App. The DoseGuide App gives dose recommendations based on their blood sugar and previous doses. Participants will record their insulin doses in the DoseGuide App.\n\nThe study will last for about 1 year and 2 months. Participants will have 8 planned clinic visits with the study doctor. More visits will be planned to meet individual needs. At 6 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Icodec","deltaMin":-1.68,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Once Daily Basal Insulin Analogue","deltaMin":-1.31,"sd":0.12}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":180,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Poland","Puerto Rico","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36106652","40465144","40186685","39699848","39368488","37748181"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":45,"n":542},"commonTop":["COVID-19"]}}
