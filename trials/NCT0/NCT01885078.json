It integrates TJC28 (scored 0-28 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity), SJC28 (scored 0-28 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (scored on a visual analogue scale from 0-10 cm with higher scores indicating higher disease activity), and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (scored on a visual analogue scale from 0-10 cm with higher scores indicating higher disease activity). The CDAI is calculated by summing the values of the 4 components. CDAI scores range from 0 to 76; lower scores indicated lower disease activity.\n\nTotal number of participants at risk multiplied by estimate of cumulative event probability would need to be rounded up or down to get a whole number.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"45.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"47.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34.5","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":112,"n":297},"commonTop":["Bronchitis","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Hypertension"]}}}
