chemotherapy administered concurrently with radiation is permitted)\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to randomization (participants must have recovered from all

brachytherapy)\n* Has received prior hormonal therapy for the treatment of endometrial carcinoma within 1 week of randomization\n* Has received prior therapy with any treatment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-directed angiogenesis, an anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1, anti-PD ligand (L)1, or anti-PD L2 agent, or with an agent directed to another stimulatory or
