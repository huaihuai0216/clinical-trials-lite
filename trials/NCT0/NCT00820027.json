The hypotheses for this study were that the average pain intensity difference (at rest) in participants treated with Etoricoxib (120 mg, 90 mg) is superior to placebo, the average total daily dose of morphine in participants treated with Etoricoxib (120 mg, 90 mg) is less than in participants treated with placebo, and that Etoricoxib (120 mg, 90 mg) will be generally safe and well tolerated by participants treated for pain following total knee replacement orthopedic surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Change From Baseline for Pain Intensity at Rest Over Days 1 to 3 (Etoricoxib vs. Placebo)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Days 1-3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Etoricoxib 90 mg","deltaMin":-3.93,"sd":null},{"arm":"Etoricoxib 120 mg","deltaMin":-3.87,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-3.39,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.018"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.009"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["24156640"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":98},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Constipation","Pyrexia","Insomnia"]}}
