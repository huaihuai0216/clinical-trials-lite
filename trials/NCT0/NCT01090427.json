The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; the higher the score, the greater impairment in quality of life.

Additionally, a Psychosocial Health and Physical Health Summary Score can be calculated as well as a total score. The measure distinguishes between healthy children and children with acute and chronic health conditions and disease severity within a chronic health condition. The measure is applicable for healthy school and community populations, as well as with pediatric populations with acute and chronic health conditions and has versions for both parent and teen report.
