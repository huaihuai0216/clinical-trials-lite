All subjects will be screened at Visit 1. If stool testing is positive for pathogenic organism, the subject will not enter treatment period and will not be allowed to rescreen\n* Any other skin disease associated with chronic itching that might influence in the investigator's opinion the study evaluations and results (e.g. atopic dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid (BP), dermatitis herpetiformis, senile pruritus, etc)\n* Prior exposure to ligelizumab\n* Any H2 antihistamine, Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist (LTRA) (montelukast or zafirlukast) or H1 antihistamines use at greater than approved dose after Visit 1\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Safety and Tolerability of Ligelizumab 120 mg q4w Treatment for 12 Months","description":"Participants with treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) summary for entire study (64 weeks)\n\nAn AE is any untoward medical occurrence, unfavorable, or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, disease, or injury, temporally associated with the use of a marketed or investigational medicinal product, gene therapy, theragnostic product, or medical device, in patients, clinical-trial subjects, device users, or other persons, whether or not it is considered to be related to or due to the product.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"UAS7 Change From Baseline Over Time","description":"Mean change from baseline in UAS7 score over time is assessed as absolute change from baseline of UAS7 by visit up to end of study.\n\nThe Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) is the sum of Hive Severity Score (HSS) and Itch Severiry Score (ISS).\n\nThe HSS has a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (\\> 12 hives/12 hours).
