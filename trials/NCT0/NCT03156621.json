Diagnosis of HoFH by at least 1 of the following genotype or clinical criteria (all patients on LDL apheresis must be diagnosed based on genotype):\n\n   1. Documented homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in both low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) alleles\n   2. Presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in Apo B, PCSK9 or LDL receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1)\n   3. Presence of double heterozygous mutations, i.e, mutations on different genes in the LDLR, Apo B or PCSK9 alleles\n   4. Untreated TC \\>500 mg/dL (12.93 mmol/L) and TG \\<300 mg/dL (3.39 mmol/L) AND Both parents with history of TC \\>250 mg/dL (6.46 mmol/L) OR cutaneous or tendinous xanthoma before age 10\n2. Receiving a stable dose of a statin at the screening visit (documentation if statin ineffective or patient unable to tolerate statin)\n3. If undergoing LDL apheresis, must have initiated LDL apheresis at least 3 months prior to screening and must have been on a stable weekly (every 7 days) or every other week (every 14 days) schedule or stable settings for at least 8 weeks\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Documented evidence of a null mutation in both LDLR alleles\n2. Use of a PCSK9 inhibitor within 10 weeks from screening visit\n3. Background medical lipid modifying therapy (LMT) that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for fibrates, 24 weeks for mipomersen, 12 weeks for maximum tolerated dose of lomitapide) before the screening visit.\n4. LDL apheresis schedule/apheresis settings that have not been stable for at least 8 weeks before the screening visit or an apheresis schedule/settings that is not anticipated to be stable over the next 24 weeks.\n5. Use of nutraceuticals or over-the-counter (OTC) therapies known to affect lipids, at a dose/amount that has not been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit or between the screening and randomization visits.\n6. Chronic use of systemic corticosteroids, unless on a stable regimen of 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent or less for at least 6 weeks prior to randomization. Note: topical, intra-articular, nasal, inhaled and ophthalmic steroid therapies are not considered as 'systemic' and are allowed\n7. Systolic blood pressure \\>160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg at the screening visit (1 repeat measurement is allowed).\n8. LDL-C level \\<70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) at the screening visit\n9. History of a myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina leading to hospitalization, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, carotid surgery or stenting, stroke, transient ischemic attack, valve replacement surgery, carotid revascularization, endovascular procedure or surgical intervention for peripheral vascular disease within 3 months prior to the screening visit.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
