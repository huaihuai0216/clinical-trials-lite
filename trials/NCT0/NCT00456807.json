Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. This study will supplement an ongoing study evaluating the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of the vaccine in women aged 26 years and above. This study will therefore assess additional immunogenicity parameters of the vaccine in women from selected investigative sites.\n\nThe Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Cytokine-positive CD4/CD8 Cells Per Million in Tests Producing at Least 2 Different Cytokines","timeFrame":"At Month 12 and Month 18 after first vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix Group","deltaMin":877.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":19.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"26 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
