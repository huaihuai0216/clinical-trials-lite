Anyone diagnosed with a minor stroke faces the possibility of long-term disability and even death, regardless of treatment. Stroke symptoms such as weakness, difficulty speaking and paralysis may improve or worsen over the hours or days immediately following a stroke. TEMPO-2 is a minor stroke trial for patients presenting within 12 hours of their symptom onset. Patients will be randomized to TNK-tPA or standard of care. In the intervention group TNK-tPA is given as a single, intravenous bolus (0.25mg/Kg) immediately upon randomization. Maximum dose 50mg. The control group will receive antiplatelet agent(s) as decided by the treating physician. Antiplatelet agent(s) choice will be at the treating physician's discretion.\n\nTEMPO-2 Coordinating Centre is located in Calgary, AB, Canada. There will be approximately 50 sites participating worldwide.\n\nDr. Shelagh Coutts is the Principal Investigator.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Return to Baseline Neurological Functioning Measured by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)","timeFrame":"90 Days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tenecteplase (tNK)","deltaMin":309,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control (Antiplatelet Agents)","deltaMin":338,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":61,"countries":["Australia","Austria","Brazil","Canada","Finland","Ireland","New Zealand","Singapore","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38768626","26387127"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":432},"commonTop":["Stroke Progression"]}}
