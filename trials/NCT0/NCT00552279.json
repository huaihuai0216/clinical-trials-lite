For subjects below the legal age of consent, written informed consent must be obtained from the subject's parents/legally acceptable representative (LAR), and written informed assent must be obtained from the subject.\n* Healthy subjects as established by medical history and/or clinical examination before entering into the study.\n* Subject must be of non-childbearing potential, or if she is of child bearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative urine pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n* Subject who had no more than 6 lifetime sexual partners prior to enrolment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days before and 30 days after the first dose of vaccine. Planned administration/administration of routine vaccines up to 8 days before the first dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the patient is outside of specified window.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period.\n* previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine\n* Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding blood sampling.\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant, likely to become pregnant (as determined by the investigator) or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions
