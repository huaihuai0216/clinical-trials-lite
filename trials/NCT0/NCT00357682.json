The use of esomeprazole and aspirin may prevent esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's metaplasia. It is not yet known whether esomeprazole is more effective with or without aspirin in preventing esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's metaplasia.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying esomeprazole with or without aspirin to compare how well they work in preventing esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's metaplasia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"First Event of Death, Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma, High Grade Dysplasia","timeFrame":"Events are assessed from the date of randomisation to the end of study which can be patient withdrawal, loss to follow up or study end (8 years or 10 years from randomisation, depending on consent)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aspirin","deltaMin":127,"sd":null},{"arm":"No Aspirin","deltaMin":154,"sd":null},{"arm":"Low Dose PPI","deltaMin":174,"sd":null},{"arm":"High Dose PPI","deltaMin":139,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.068"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.037"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["30057104"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":340,"n":1138},"commonTop":[]}}
