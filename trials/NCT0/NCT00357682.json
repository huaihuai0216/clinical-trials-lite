Aged ≥18 years.\n2. Circumferential Barrett's metaplasia of at least 1cm in length (≥C1M1) or a tongue of Barrett's metaplasia of at least 2cm in length (≥C0M2) (irrespective of the presence now or historically of histologically proven intestinal metaplasia).\n3. Able to give written informed consent.\n4. WHO performance status of 0 or 1 i.e. fully active and self-caring.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\n1. High grade dysplasia or carcinoma at enrolment.\n2. Medical conditions which would make completing endoscopies or completing the trial difficult including:\n\n   1. Frequent transient ischaemic attacks (3 or more) or severe cerebral vascular accident in the previous 6 months\\*\n   2. Severe respiratory disease with arterial oxygen saturation less 90% at rest\n   3. Severe ischaemic heart disease (exercise tolerance less than 100 yards or life expectancy \\< 4 years) or myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months\n   4. Severe inflammatory bowel disease requiring at least one hospital admission of 5 days in the last year or bowels open \\> 6 times/day \\* Patients answering yes to criterion a. were eligible for the PPI-only (non-aspirin) arms of the trial\n3. Continuous/frequent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or COX-2 inhibitors (more than 60 days per year in total).\n4. Patients with absolute contraindications to PPIs, aspirin or their excipients i.e. allergies, ulcers, renal impairment or use of oral anticoagulants.\n5. Pregnant or lactating women will not undergo endoscopy and may be given dispensation to stop drug therapy for a year. This should be discussed with the Trial Office.\n\nIf a patient was suitable for inclusion but later becomes unsuitable this should be discussed with the Trial Office before they are withdrawn. Only in exceptional circumstances should patients not be followed up i.e. withdrawal of consent or current life threatening disease with poor outcome and therefore unable to tolerate endoscopy. In these circumstances patients should be followed up in outpatient clinics.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"First Event of Death, Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma, High Grade Dysplasia","description":"Death is recorded on a continuous basis through reporting from trial sites.
