A higher rank score (range 0-1) is considered a better outcome.\n\nThe reported values are the mean rank scores in each group for the composite endpoint.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.51","spread":"0.291"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.49","spread":"0.283"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Permanent Assisted Ventilation (PAV) / Tracheostomy / Death","description":"Time from baseline to one of the events (PAV / tracheostomy / death).
