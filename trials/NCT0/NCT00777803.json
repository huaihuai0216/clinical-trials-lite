Injected into the muscle, NT201 causes a reversible local relaxation of the injected muscle. Botulinum toxin type A is used for aesthetic treatment of mimic wrinkles and in the therapy of neurologic diseases. This study will investigate the safety and efficacy (non-inferiority) of NT 201 in comparison with OnabotulinumtoxinA (Vistabel®) in the treatment of glabellar frown lines.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Responder by Independent Rater's Assessment at Maximum Frown at Week 4","timeFrame":"4 weeks after injection","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®/Bocouture®)","deltaMin":267,"sd":null},{"arm":"OnabotulinumtoxinA (Vistabel®)","deltaMin":89,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["Austria","Germany","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21134045"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":284},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Gastrointestinal infection"]}}
