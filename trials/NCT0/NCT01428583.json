(The exception is during the Pre-Treatment Period when the subject may continue current opioid therapy to guide first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period when the subject may administer immediate-release oxycodone to support conversion to study drug.)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject has moderate or severe chronic pain due to cancer, migraine, recent trauma, infection, or other pain expected to be short-term (duration less than 3 months).\n* Subject has a documented history of alcohol or drug abuse within 1 year prior to study entry that in the Investigator's judgment would impact subject participation.\n* Subject has ongoing or active alcohol or drug abuse that in the Investigator's judgment would impact subject participation.\n* Subject has a positive urine drug test for illicit drug use or medications at screening without legitimate medical explanation.\n* Subject has a clinically significant medical condition (e.g., cardiovascular, neurological, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematological, immunological, rheumatological, metabolic, or psychiatric) or physical examination, vital signs (VS), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory abnormalities that in the opinion of the Investigator would impact the safety of the subject during study participation.\n* If female, the subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n* Subject has a known history or known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, oxycodone salts, naltrexone or acetaminophen,or pharmacological similar compounds.\n* Subject is historically non-responsive to oxycodone treatment or requires greater than 160 mg oxycodone in a 24-hour time interval.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Adverse Reactions","description":"An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.
