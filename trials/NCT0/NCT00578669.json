The secondary aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that, among smokers with elevated depressive symptoms, sequential treatment with fluoxetine will result in lower levels of depressive symptoms and negative mood and higher levels of positive mood immediately prior to and throughout the course of smoking cessation treatment relative to the placebo condition.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Achieving Smoking Abstinence","timeFrame":"One year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sequential Fluoxetine","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sequential Placebo","deltaMin":18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.butler.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":107},"commonTop":["Frequent bowel movements"]}}
