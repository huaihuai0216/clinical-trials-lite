Tropical enteropathy, which is associated with intestinal inflammation, decreased absorption and increased permeability, may contribute substantially to oral vaccine failure in developing country settings. Other possible causes of oral vaccine underperformance include malnutrition, interference with maternal or breastmilk antibodies, changes in gut microbiota, and genetic susceptibility.\n\nPrimary Objective: to determine whether tropical enteropathy impairs the efficacy of oral polio and rotavirus vaccines in children in Bangladesh.\n\nSecondary Objectives: 1) to determine the impact of an IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) boost on the efficacy of OPV (oral polio vaccine) and 2) to determine the efficacy of Rotarix oral rotavirus vaccine to prevent rotavirus diarrhea\n\nThe polio and rotavirus randomized clinical trials are embedded as secondary objectives within the exploratory study of tropical enteropathy. The primary and secondary outcome measures are relevant to the randomized clinical trials.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Presence of Fecal Shedding of Polio Vaccine Virus Determined by Culture (Polio Trial)","timeFrame":"25 days following week 52 visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine)","deltaMin":99,"sd":null},{"arm":"No IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine)","deltaMin":109,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.4"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Bangladesh"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25711607","27217217","26643930","26870801","39052701","34565452","32867719","32157282","29514306","29394355","29390150","28444240","28293424","27154394"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":175},"commonTop":[]}}
