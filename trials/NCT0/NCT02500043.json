Last 2 questions represented participant's assessment of overall health and QoL, coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). EORTC QLQ-C30 observed values and change from baseline for global health status (scoring of questions 29 and 30) and 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales and other single items (scoring of questions 1 to 28).
