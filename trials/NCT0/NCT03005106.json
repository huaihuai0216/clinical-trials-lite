They will have complex skin defects because of burns caused by heat.\n\nThe burns will:\n\n* be on 3-49% of the participant's total body surface area (TBSA)\n* require surgery for skin replacement\n* include intact dermal elements\n\nThe burns are called deep, partial-thickness thermal burns because the skin was damaged by heat but still has some dermis that was not damaged.\n\nThe dermis is the layer of skin under the outer layer (epidermis). It is the thickest layer of the skin that provides strength and flexibility to the skin.\n\nAll patients will receive both treatments, but on different areas of their burns. Their wounds will not be compared to other patients. One treatment area on their own body will be compared to the other one.\n\nThis will help to find out if StrataGraft is safe and effective for deep partial thickness burns. It will also see if StrataGraft might help healing enough to use it instead of the patient's own healthy skin to repair the damage.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Area of Treatment Sites Requiring Autografting by Month 3","timeFrame":"3 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All Participants","deltaMin":4.33,"sd":21.58}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34099322"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":71},"commonTop":["Pruritus","Hypertrophic scar","Blister","Constipation","Pain"]}}
