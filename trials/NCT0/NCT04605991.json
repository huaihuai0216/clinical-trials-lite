Metformin\n  2. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor\n  3. sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor\n  4. oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist\n* Doses of OAMs are required to have been stable for at least 90 days prior to screening.\n* Participants may be treated with injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist for T2D in accordance with local regulations. The GLP-1 receptor agonist dose is required to have been stable for at least 90 days prior to screening.\n* Have an HbA1c value ≥7.5% and ≤10% according to the central laboratory at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have been diagnosed at any time with type 1 diabetes mellitus or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.\n* Have had any episode of severe hypoglycemia (defined as requiring assistance due to neurologically disabling hypoglycemia) within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Have had any episode of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Have hypoglycemia unawareness as judged by the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Percentage of Time With Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Sensor Glucose Values Between 70-180 Milligrams/Deciliter (mg/dL) (3.9-10.0 Millimoles/Liter [mmol/L]) (Both Inclusive) During Daytime Period at Week 12","description":"Least Squares (LS) mean was determined by mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) model with Baseline + Time as variables.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.8","spread":"1.38"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 12","description":"HbA1c is the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A.
