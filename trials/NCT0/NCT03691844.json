Women of child-bearing potential must use at least an acceptably effective method of contraception from enrollment up to at least 3 months after the study end.\n4. Knee pain in the target knee for 14 days of the preceding month (knee pain due to osteoarthritis and not due to another condition such as bursitis, tendinitis, etc.) based on subject report.\n5. On stable pain therapy (i.e., at least 3 days per week for the previous month) with an oral or topical NSAID prescribed by physician for 30 days prior to the Screening Visit and/or prescribed over-the-counter.\n6. Except for osteoarthritis, in reasonably good health as determined by the Investigator.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Presence of an additional non-osteoarthritic disease affecting either knee, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, gout or pseudo-gout, if there is reason to believe that the disease(s) may significantly interfere with the interpretation of the clinical response to the study drug.\n7. Medical history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n8. Current cancer or treatment for cancer within the past five years, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer, unless affecting the target knee area.\n9. Secondary osteoarthritis of the target knee, previous procedures or trauma affecting joint of the target knee.\n10. Reported incidence of any of the following diseases: known osteoarthritis of the hip(s) if pain in hip(s) exceeds that of the target knee using the WOMAC Hip Pain subscore, presence of significant back pain, or at least one migraine attack within the past 12 months before screening, as reported by the subject.\n11. Body Mass Index \\> 45.0 kg/m2.\n12. Generalized skin irritation, previous skin reactions upon use of topical NSAIDs, current skin irritation or redness at the planned site of gel application, or significant skin disease including psoriasis, as judged by the investigator.\n13. Known presence of a ulcer or any gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months prior to screening.\n14. Use of moderate or higher doses of opioid medication for the treatment of pain within 6 weeks before the screening visit.\n15. Use of duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin within 4 weeks before the screening visit.\n16.
