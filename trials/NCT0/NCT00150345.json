Hence their decrease (called \"neutropenia\") leads to a predisposition to infections.\n\nSince infections during neutropenia can be very dangerous, the patients are treated with antibiotics from the very first signs of such an infection (usually fever). If the antibiotics (drugs against bacteria) do not lead to a normalization of the body temperature within four days, a drug against fungi is added.\n\nIn the IDEA study, one half of the patients receive the antifungal drug voriconazole (as usual) only in case the antibiotics alone do not lead to a normalization of the body temperature (current standard of care). The other half of the patients receive voriconazole immediately after onset of fever (concomitantly with the antibiotics).\n\nThe research question is, whether in the \"early-treatment\" group fewer manifest fungal infections will be observed than in the \"late-treatment\" group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Proven or Probable Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI): Complete Case Analysis","timeFrame":"Day 2 through Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Voriconazole","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Deferred Voriconazole Treatment","deltaMin":9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.258"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A1501029&StudyName=Immediate%20vs.%20Deferred%20Empirical%20Antifungal%20Treatment%20With%20Voriconazole%20In%20Neutropenic%20Patients"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":81},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Rash","Headache","Nausea","Epistaxis"]}}
