During the treatment period, in accordance with standard of care, corticosteroid dose will be tapered. The key outcomes in the study focus on evaluation of clinical remission, defined as Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS)=0 with a corticosteroid dose of \\<=4 mg/day prednisolone/prednisone, reduction in disease relapse and reduction in corticosteroid requirement.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants in Each Category of Accrued Duration of Remission","timeFrame":"Up to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":55,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mepolizumab 300mg","deltaMin":32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28514601"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":68},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Sinusitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
