The study also includes a population pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy to assess the hydroxyprogesterone caproate (HPC) exposure-response relationship and the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the PK of 17P.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Preterm Birth <35 Weeks Gestation","timeFrame":"Up to 35 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vehicle","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"17P (Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection)","deltaMin":122,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":104,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Canada","Czechia","Hungary","Italy","Russia","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31652479"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":578},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Headache","Nausea","Afterbirth pain","Back pain"]}}
