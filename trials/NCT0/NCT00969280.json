For every question, participants checked at a score between 0 and 4, where 0 equals \"none of the time\" and 4 equals \"all of the time\". OSDI scores will be calculated according to the following formula: OSDI = \\[(sum of scores for all questions answered)\\*100\\] / \\[(total number of questions answered)\\*4\\]. The possible range of the OSDI score is 0 to 100. Mean difference of the OSDI scores was calculated from the OSDI scores between Visit 11 and baseline.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-17.61","spread":"15.61"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-17.20","spread":"18.81"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Visual Analogue Scale of Self Symptoms","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Schirmer 1 Test","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Tear Film Break-up Time : BUT","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Medication Quantification Scale (MQS)","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"General Assessment","description":null,"classes":[]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":[]}}}
