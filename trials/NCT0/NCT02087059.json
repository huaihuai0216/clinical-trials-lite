Stem cell transplantation is not a treatment option at present because it is not indicated or because there are no suitable donors.\n9. All drugs used to treat MF were discontinued at least 28 days before treatment initiation.\n10. Informed consent form should be signed before any screening procedures is performed\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Hepatic or renal impairment as indicated by the following:\n\n   * Direct bilirubin ≥2-fold than the upper limit of normal (ULN)\n   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>2.5-fold ULN\n   * Creatinine \\>2.0 mg/dL\n2. Clinically significant infection by bacteria, fungus, mycobacteria, parasite, or virus (screening and enrollment postponed until completion of antibiotic treatment in patients with an acute bacterial infection that requires antibiotic use)\n3. Active hepatitis A, B, or C or HIV infection defined by a positive IgM-HA Ab test \\[hepatitis A virus antibody (immunoglobulin M \\[IgM\\])\\], HBs Ag test (hepatitis B surface antigen), HCV Ab test (hepatitis C virus antibody), or HIV Ab (human immunodeficiency virus antibody) at screening.\n4. History of malignancy within the previous 3 years, except for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma.\n5. History of serious congenital or acquired hemorrhagic disease\n6. Previous platelet count \\<25,000/μL or absolute neutrophil count \\<500/μL, except for patients currently undergoing treatment for a myeloproliferative neoplasm or cytotoxic therapy for any other reason.\n7. Splenic irradiation within 12 months before screening\n8. Administration of hematopoietic growth factor receptor agonists (erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, romiplostim, eltrombopag) within 14 days before screening or 28 days before treatment initiation.\n9. Currently receiving another investigational drug, or received another investigational drug within 30 days before the start of treatment.\n10. History of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome within 6 months before screening\n11. Poorly controlled or unstable angina at present\n12. Rapid or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at present\n13. Active alcohol or drug addiction that could hinder the patient's ability to comply with the study's requirements\n14. Pregnant or currently breastfeeding woman\n15. Women of childbearing potential or men with reproductive ability who are unwilling to take appropriate contraception measures\n16.
