At least 2 days of \"moderate\" or \"severe\" dysmenorrhea (DYS) AND either\n  2. At least 2 days of \"moderate\" or \"severe\" non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) and an average NMPP score of at least 1.0, OR\n  3. At least 4 days of \"moderate\" or \"severe\" NMPP and an average NMPP score of at least 0.5.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has chronic pelvic pain that is not caused by endometriosis, that requires chronic analgesic therapy, which would interfere with the assessment of endometriosis-related pain.\n* Participant is using any systemic corticosteroids for over 14 days within 3 months prior to Screening or is likely to require treatment with systemic corticosteroids during the course of the study. Over-the-counter and prescription topical, inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Participant has a history of any major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) within 2 years of the screening visit or other major psychiatric disorder at any time.\n* Participant has a history of suicide attempts or answered \"yes\" to questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) within the last 1 year at Screening or prior to randomization on Day 1.\n* Participant has any history of osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease or any condition that would interfere with obtaining adequate dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements\n* Screening DXA results of the lumbar spine (L1-L4), femoral neck or total hip bone mineral density (BMD) corresponding to less than 2.0 or more standard deviations below normal.\n* Participant has either:\n\n  1. a newly diagnosed, clinically significant medical condition that requires therapeutic intervention (e.g., new onset hypertension), that has not been stabilized 30 days prior to randomization on Day 1 OR\n  2. a clinically significant medical condition that is anticipated to require intervention during the course of study participation (e.g., anticipated major elective surgery) OR\n  3. an unstable medical condition that makes the subject an unsuitable candidate for the study in the opinion of the Investigator, (including, but not limited to, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, epilepsy requiring anti-epileptic medication, unstable angina, confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, hyperprolactinemia, clinically significant infection or injury).\n* Participant has any conditions contraindicated with use of E2/NETA.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"49 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Co-Primary Endpoint: Percentage of Participants With a Response for Dysmenorrhea (DYS) at Months 6 and 12 Based on Daily Assessment","description":"Participants recorded rescue analgesic use for endometriosis-associated pain daily and DYS (pain during menstruation ) and its impact on daily activities each day of their period in an electronic diary (e-Diary).
