This is to compare the effect on body weight in people taking semaglutide (a new medicine) and people taking \"dummy\" medicine. In addition to taking the medicine, participants will have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more physically active and what participants can do to lose weight. Participants will either get semaglutide or \"dummy\" medicine - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Participants are three times as likely to get semaglutide as \"dummy\" medicine. Participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skinfold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm. The study will last for about one and a half years. Participants will have 14 clinic visits and 11 phone calls with the study doctor.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Body Weight (%)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), week 68","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide 1.7 mg","deltaMin":-9.9,"sd":7.8},{"arm":"Semaglutide 2.4 mg","deltaMin":-13.4,"sd":8.6},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.9,"sd":5.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["Japan","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33667417","40189961","35131037"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":100},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Constipation","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Back pain"]}}
