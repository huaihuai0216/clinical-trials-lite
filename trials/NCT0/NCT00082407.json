This criterion includes drugs that have not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.\n* Patients have had greater than three episodes of severe hypoglycemia within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Patients have less than 5 years of remission history from any malignancy (other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ carcinomas of the cervix, or in situ prostate cancer).\n* Patients have cardiac disease that is Class III or IV, according to the New York Heart Association criteria.\n* Patients have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to biphasic insulin aspart, exenatide, or excipients contained in these agents.\n* Patients have characteristics contraindicating metformin or sulfonylurea use, according to product-specific label.\n* Patients have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal dialysis or have serum creatinine \\>=1.5 mg/dL for males and \\>=1.2 mg/dL for females.\n* Patients have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, acute or chronic hepatitis, or alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range.\n* Patients have known hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia.\n* Patients have active proliferative retinopathy or macular edema.\n* Patients are receiving treatment for gastrointestinal disease with a drug directly affecting gastrointestinal motility, including but not limited to metoclopramide, cisapride, and chronic macrolide antibiotics.\n* Patients are receiving chronic (lasting longer than 2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical and inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within 2 weeks immediately prior to screening.\n* Patients have used any prescription drug to promote weight loss within 3 months prior to screening.\n* Patients have been treated for longer than 2 weeks with any of the following excluded medications within 3 months prior to screening: insulin, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinides.\n* Patients have any other condition (including known drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric disorder) that precludes them from following and completing the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Patients fail to satisfy the investigator of suitability to participate for any other reason.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"75
