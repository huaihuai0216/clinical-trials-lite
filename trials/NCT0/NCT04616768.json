English-speaking\n2. Have a diagnosis of incurable or Stage IV lung or gastrointestinal cancer\n3. Receive primary oncology care with a thoracic or gastrointestinal medical oncology specialist at the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine (i.e. does not have a local oncologist that provides cancer care, including other UPHS clinic sites)\n4. Currently receiving or planned receipt within 2 weeks of IV chemotherapy (see exclusions below)\n5. The patient has a smart phone that can receive SMS text messages and has blue-tooth capability that can connect to Fitbit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Age \\< 18 years\n2. Patients has used a wheelchair, been bedbound or is unable to walk without assistance from other people every day for the past 7 days (patients are not excluded for the use of walkers or canes)\n3. Patients who are receiving checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy or oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n4. Patients who receive chemotherapy infusions at another UPHS site or outside of UPHS or whose primary oncologist is not in thoracic or gastrointestinal oncology groups at PCAM. Notably, patients who receive part of their chemotherapy regimen at home will still be allowed to enroll.\n5. Lung cancer patients enrolled in an ongoing palliative care clinical trial that may lead to better communication regarding symptoms and functional status.\n6. Clinician concerns about behavioral health issues that may prevent engagement with text message prompts\n7. Are enrolled in another interventional clinical trial (as clinical trials often have a substantial symptom-reporting structure; non-interventional clinical trials are permitted e.g. trials that just involve blood tests)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Patient Perceptions of Symptom Management - How Well do You Feel Your Oncology Team Understands Your Symptoms (e.g. Nausea, Vomiting, Weight Loss, Etc.)?","description":"Patient utility surveys will use a 5-point Likert scale for responses scored 1-5.
