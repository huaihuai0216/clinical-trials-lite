These clinicals demonstrated a reduction of inflammation in all lung and sinus diseases, in patients with COPD, Pulmonary fibrosis, CF, asthma, sinusitis , the flu and nasal inflammation and congestion. Inhaled sodium pyruvate reduces inflammation, congestion and in our phase III clinical study with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis patients we demonstrated statistically and clinical significant increase in FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (form 52% to 86%) and a decrease in hypoxemia, and a reduction in coughing. Inhaled sodium pyruvate alleviated the symptoms associated with COVID-19 patients in Pulmonary Fibrosis, and may be a solution to the lingering COVID-19 symptoms in patients that had the COVID-19 infection for example long haulers. In flu and COVID infected mice, nebulized sodium pyruvate decreased morbidity, weight loss, inflammatory cytokines and decreased viral titers compared to placebo controls. The study to be done at Missouri State University is titled ( Two week sub-chronic double-blinded placebo controlled trial designed to determine if sodium pyruvate nasal spray will reduce the symptoms, duration and replication of COVID-19 infection)","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Evaluate the Ability of Inhaled Nasal Sodium Pyruvate to Change COVID-19 Viral Titers.","timeFrame":"Day 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment of COVID-19 Infected Patients With a Sodium Pyruvate Nasal Spray","deltaMin":5.61,"sd":0.26},{"arm":"Placebo Control Treatment of COVID-19 Infected Patients","deltaMin":6.57,"sd":0.24}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0197"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32634445"],"seeAlso":["http://emphycorp.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
