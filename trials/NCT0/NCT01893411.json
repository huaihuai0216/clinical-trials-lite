The QPS Total Score for pain intensity ranges from 0 ('No Hurt') to 10 ('Hurt Worst'). The QPS Total Score for the observed pain frequency ranges from 0 (Never) to 4 (Always).\n\nValues represent least square (LS) mean differences between baseline and the respective week (w) resulting from ANCOVA models comparing high versus low and in a second step mid versus low dose groups, respectively. Values for the low group may differ slightly depending on the comparison and are therefore provided separately for each comparison.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.66","spread":"0.198"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.32","spread":"0.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.02","spread":"0.301"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.61","spread":"0.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.6","spread":"0.228"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.93","spread":"0.265"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.94","spread":"0.299"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.06","spread":"0.308"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.42","spread":"0.207"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.13","spread":"0.241"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.14","spread":"0.253"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.47","spread":"0.261"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.44","spread":"0.067"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.49","spread":"0.089"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.31","spread":"0.094"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.34","spread":"0.093"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.48","spread":"0.069"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.47","spread":"0.092"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.29","spread":"0.092"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.33","spread":"0.091"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.44","spread":"0.071"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.37","spread":"0.095"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.21","spread":"0.095"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.3","spread":"0.095"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.53","spread":"0.26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.03","spread":"0.289"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.36","spread":"0.347"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.53","spread":"0.351"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.78","spread":"0.272"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.16","spread":"0.302"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.56","spread":"0.312"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.61","spread":"0.315"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.34","spread":"0.299"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.97","spread":"0.333"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.37","spread":"0.333"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.4","spread":"0.336"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.54","spread":"0.078"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.47","spread":"0.102"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.59","spread":"0.111"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.46","spread":"0.105"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.55","spread":"0.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.47","spread":"0.104"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.54","spread":"0.119"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.44","spread":"0.113"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.49","spread":"0.085"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.4","spread":"0.112"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.52","spread":"0.128"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.33","spread":"0.121"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Reinjection for Each of the Three Dose Groups for the First and Second Injection Cycle","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.3","spread":"4.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.9","spread":"5.7"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"15.7","spread":"5.9"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":"6.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.9","spread":"7.8"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"15.5","spread":"4.9"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Occurrence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Overall and Per Injection Cycle","description":"Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) are events observed from the time point of first injection until end of study visit (week 24-72).
