This technique depends, in part, on adequate distension of the small bowel. This is accomplished by administering large volumes of a non-absorbable oral contrast material prior to the examination, which typically produces excellent distension of the distal small bowel and stomach, but poor distension of the proximal small bowel. Erythromycin is a common antibiotic that is known to promote stomach emptying and is used to treat diabetics with gastroparesis (poor stomach emptying.) The hypothesis of this study was that erythromycin will increase gastric emptying and hence improve small and large intestinal distention during MRI.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Gastric Volume","timeFrame":"Approximately 60 minutes after beginning ingestion of fluid volume","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Erythromycin","deltaMin":262,"sd":52},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":718,"sd":59}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
