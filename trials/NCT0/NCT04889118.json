Participants that do not have a BRAF V600 mutation but did receive BRAF or BRAF/MEKi therapy are eligible to participate in this study after discussion with the medical monitor.\n\n  b. Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, with targeted therapy or immunotherapy (such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 \\[CTLA-4\\], anti-programmed cell death 1 \\[anti-PD-1\\] therapy or interferon) will only be permitted if relapse did not occur during active treatment or within 6 months of treatment discontinuation.\n* Have documentation of BRAF V600-activating mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation testing during the Screening period (participants with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma as well as BRAF wild-type or unknown are eligible).\n* Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1.\n* Has the presence of ≥1 measurable lesion by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per RECIST 1.1.\n* Provides a tumor biopsy. Participants must submit tumor sample during Screening for confirmation of adequacy of tumor tissue at a central pathology laboratory.

Note: Participants with ≥2+ (≥100 mg/dL) proteinuria on urine dipstick testing (or urinalysis) will undergo 24-hour urine collection for quantitative assessment of proteinuria.\n* Prolongation of QTcF interval to \\>480 ms. Note: If the QTcF is prolonged to \\>480 ms in the presence of a pacemaker, contact the Sponsor to determine eligibility.\n* Has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below the institutional (or local laboratory) normal range, as determined by multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) or echocardiogram.\n* Has received prior therapy in the adjuvant setting. Note: Targeted therapy, anti-CTLA-4, or anti-PD-1 may be allowed.\n* Has received prior systemic treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma other than targeted therapy as noted in Inclusion Criteria above.\n* Has received prior therapy with a monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, or an investigational agent or device within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before administration of study treatment or not recovered (≤Grade 1 or at Baseline) from adverse events due to previously administered agents.\n\nException to this rule would be use of denosumab, which is not excluded. Note: Participants with alopecia and ≤Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception and may enroll.\n\n* Has received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of first dose of study treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1). Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis.\n* Has received live vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n* Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the participant's participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.\n* Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.\n* Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)","description":"PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.
