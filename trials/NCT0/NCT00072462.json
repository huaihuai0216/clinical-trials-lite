Hormone therapy using either tamoxifen or anastrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. It is not yet known whether tamoxifen is more effective than anastrozole in preventing breast cancer after surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well adjuvant tamoxifen works compared to anastrozole in treating postmenopausal women who have undergone surgery to remove ductal carcinoma in situ.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Breast Cancer Recurrence, Including Recurrent DCIS and New Contralateral Tumours","timeFrame":"Date of the breast cancer occurrence is defined as the date of the confirmation of the specific event (from randomisation to date of occurrence).
