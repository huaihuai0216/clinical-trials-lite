This trial will include male and female subjects 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), who have experienced at least one previous manic episode of sufficient severity to require hospitalization and/or treatment with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic agent in addition to their current manic episode. All subjects must be experiencing a manic episode (per DSM-IV-TR criteria) with a YMRS total score â‰¥ 20 at trial entry. Both inpatients and outpatients are eligible for this trial.\n\nThis trial will consist of a screening phase followed by 4 treatment phases. Subjects will undergo screening for eligibility, followed by a conversion to oral aripiprazole monotherapy phase, if needed, an oral aripiprazole stabilization phase, a single-blind aripiprazole IM depot stabilization phase, and, a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time From Randomization to Recurrence of Any Mood Episode During Double-bind Placebo-controlled Phase.","timeFrame":"Baseline of the Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase Up to the end of the study (Week 52).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aripiprazole IM Depot","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":308,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":76,"countries":["United States","Canada","Japan","Poland","Romania","South Korea","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28146613"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":32,"n":459},"commonTop":["Akathisia","Weight increased","Insomnia","Restlessness","Anxiety"]}}
