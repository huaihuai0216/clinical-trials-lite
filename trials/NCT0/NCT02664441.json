Following baseline testing, 48 patients will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to ExQW or matching placebo injection for 36 weeks, followed by an 18 week open label extension during which all patients receive ExQW. Changes of weight status, body composition, free-living total daily energy expenditure (EE) by doubly labeled water (DLW), activity by acetimetry, energy intake (questionnaires and food diary), as well as glucose tolerance and hormonal parameters of energy homeostasis and insulin resistance will be assessed before treatment and at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (week 36). Activity, metabolic outcomes, energy intake will be also assessed at study week 18 (mid treatment of randomized study), as well as week 54 (end of open label treatment).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change of Body Mass Index (BMI) as Calculated by the Formula: Body Weight in kg Divided by Height in Meters².","timeFrame":"From baseline to 36 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Exenatide Once Weekly Extended-release","deltaMin":1.7,"sd":0.8},{"arm":"Matching Placebo","deltaMin":3.5,"sd":0.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.40"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":23},"commonTop":["Headache","Diarrhea","Vomiting","Injection site reaction","Abdominal pain"]}}
