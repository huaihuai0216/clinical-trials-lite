A standardized test meal preload provided 20% of estimated daily caloric requirements,based on the Schofield-HW equation. The purpose of the test meal is to ensure that study participants are in an equally fed state. Ninety minutes later, an ad libitum buffet meal was served consisting of a wide variety of food items and more than the child's estimated daily calorie requirements will be offered (5,000 kcal). Children had access to the buffet for 30 min, after which calorie intake and composition of consumed foods was measured by weighing back uneaten food.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-9.5","spread":"6.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.5","spread":"7.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-287","spread":"130"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"224","spread":"136"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes in Fasting Glucose","description":"Change in fasting blood glucose between baseline and the end of the 36-week randomized drug treatment phase.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.4","spread":"6.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.7","spread":"3.5"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes in HDL Cholesterol and Triglycerides Assessed by Fasting Lipids","description":"Change in fasting HDL cholesterol and triglycerides between baseline and the end of the 36-week randomized drug treatment phase.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7","spread":"2.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":"2.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.6","spread":"8.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.2","spread":"8.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes in Inflammation Assessed by C-reactive Protein (CRP)","description":"Change in C-reactive protein (CRP) between baseline and the end of the 36-week randomized drug treatment phase.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":"0.07"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.18","spread":"0.27"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes of Insulin Resistance Assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)","description":"Changes of insulin resistance estimated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) using the formula HOMA-IR = insulin \\[mU/l\\] x glucose \\[mmol/l\\]) / 22.5 where both insulin and glucose values are obtained from a fasting blood sample.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.5","spread":"1.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.2","spread":"2.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes of Circulating Leptin Levels","description":"Change in circulating leptin between baseline and the end of the 36-week randomized drug treatment phase.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.4","spread":"6.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.8","spread":"9.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes of Energy Expenditure Assessed by Doubly Labeled Water Analysis","description":"Total energy expenditure in the free-living environment was measured using doubly labeled water which estimates carbon dioxide production by measuring the elimination of the tracers deuterium (²H) and oxygen-18 (¹⁸O) from the body.
