Severe comorbidities including unstable cardiac, (e.g., myocardial infarction within 1 year prior to screening, unstable angina within 6 months, or unstable or life-threatening arrhythmia requiring intervention within 3 months) or any other clinically significant medical conditions including uncontrolled diseases (e.g., endocrine, neurological, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, hematological, urological, immunological, psychiatric or ophthalmic diseases) that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, preclude the subject from safely completing the required tests or the study, or is likely to result in disease progression that would require withdrawal of the subject.\n7. HIV infection or other immunodeficiency.\n8. Previous lung resection or lung reduction surgery within 1-year.\n9. Long term oxygen use defined as oxygen therapy prescribed for greater than 12 hours per day.\n10. Pulmonary rehabilitation unless such treatment has been stable for at least 4 weeks and remains stable during the study.\n11. History of or current malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated within the past 5 years, except for localized basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n12.

Known alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal (ULN), alkaline phosphatase and/or bilirubin \\> 1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin \\> 1.5 × ULN is acceptable if fractionated bilirubin \\< 35%).\n15. Known diagnosis of severe chronic kidney disease.\n16. Any other known abnormal clinical, cardiac or laboratory (hematology, biochemistry or viral) findings, deemed by an investigator to be clinically significantly abnormal.\n17.

Use of an experimental drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, and/or participation in a study treatment-free follow-up phase of a clinical study within 30 days.\n21. Use of an experimental medical device or participation in a follow-up phase of an experimental medical device clinical study within 30 days.\n22. Affiliation with the investigator site, including an Investigator, Sub-Investigator, study coordinator, study nurse, other employee of participating investigator or study site or a family member of the aforementioned.\n23. A disclosed history or one known to the Investigator of significant noncompliance in previous investigational studies or with prescribed medications.\n24. Any other reason that the Investigator considers makes the subject unsuitable to participate.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Proportion of CAT Score Responders in the Full Analysis Set at Week 12","description":"Responders are defined as an improvement (decrease) from baseline of ≥2 points.
