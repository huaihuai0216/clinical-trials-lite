If opiates are positive at screening and clearly due to the use of pain killing medication, the patient may be re screened after the medication has been discontinued and enrolled in the study if urine drug screen is negative.\n* Note: Occasional users of recreational drugs other than cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens, or parenteral drugs may be recruited. Patients who are dependent on nicotine, caffeine, or theophylline are allowed to enter the study.\n* Patients who are mentally disabled (moderate to severe).\n* Patients who have had a history of being in a coma for more than 24 hrs.\n* Patients who have had thoughts of committing suicide within 6 months prior to screening or at baseline or suicide behaviors within 2 years prior to screening or at baseline.\n* Patients thought to be of imminent risk of harm to others or in imminent legal difficulty.\n* Patients under any form of legal compulsion to remain hospitalized or undergo treatment or assessment.\n* Patients who have any disability that prevent them from completing any of the study requirements.\n* Patients with a known clinically significant ECG abnormality including PR interval \\>240 msec, QRS complex \\>110 msec, QTcF \\>=450 msec, or congenital long QT syndrome based on central ECG reading results\n* Treatment naive, first episode patients,\n* Patients taking iloperidone at the screening visit or with a known hypersensitivity to drugs chemically related to benzioxazoles.\n* Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to the patient or the study results.\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to Relapse or Impending Relapse","description":"Relapse or impending relapse was defined as any of the following: hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia; increase (worsening) of the PANSS total score of greater than or equal to 30% from randomization, PANSS total score confirmed at a second visit conducted within 1-7 days; clinically significant emergent or worsening suicidal, homicidal, or aggressive behavior; a CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) after randomization; a dose increase in study medication or a need for additional open-label antipsychotic treatment.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"99","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"PANSS Total Score, Change From Baseline to Last Visit","description":"The 30-item Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was developed to assess the severity of symptoms of schizophrenia.
