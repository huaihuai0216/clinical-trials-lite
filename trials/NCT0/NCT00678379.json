The objective of the current study is to conduct a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using a pre-tonsillectomy infiltration of the tonsillar fossa comparing three treatment regimens in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity (i.e. pain, poor oral intake): 1) Placebo (saline injection) 2) bupivacaine (0.5%) + lidocaine (1%), 3) bupivacaine (0.5%) + lidocaine (1%) + clonidine (25 Âµg).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Number of Post-operative Doses of Analgesics.","timeFrame":"Post-operative thru day 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Normal Saline","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lidocaine (1%) + Bupivacaine 0.5%","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lidocaine 1% + Bupivacaine o.5% + Clondine 25mcg","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17312203","16159655","17720118","8436459","1784501","11587610","21422302"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Dehydration","Bleeding","Emergency Department admission","Lingual nerve palsy","Severe pain"]}}
