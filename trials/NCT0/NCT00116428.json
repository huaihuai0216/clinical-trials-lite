The investigational catheter being studied is the NAVISTAR® THERMOCOOL® irrigated-tip catheter. At the time of this study, the NAVISTAR® THERMOCOOL® catheter was FDA-approved for commercial distribution in the U.S. for treating patients with Type I atrial flutter and drug refractory monomorphic ventricular tachycardia post myocardial infarction. The catheter was approved for use in Europe for endocardial ablation for treating cardiac arrhythmias.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Percentage of Chronic Success of the NAVISTAR THERMOCOOL Catheter for the Treatment of Symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF)","timeFrame":"The evaluation time frame for the THERMOCOOL catheter subjects is 91-361 days (12 months) post procedure; for Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy subjects the time frame is 15-285 days (9 months) post procedure.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NAVISTAR® THERMOCOOL® Catheter","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"Antiarrhythmic Drug","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Canada","Czechia","Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20103757","20940250"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":139},"commonTop":["Back pain","Hematuria","Neurologic Side Effects","Hematoma/Bleeding/groin pain","Shortness of Breath"]}}
