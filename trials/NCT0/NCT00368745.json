Subjects return weekly for assessment of safety/tolerability of pregabalin vs placebo as well as for assessment of anxiety and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Subjects successfully able to discontinue alprazolam, will continue 6 weeks of treatment with pregabalin vs placebo (free of benzodiazepine use). The efficacy and safety of pregabalin vs placebo for anxiety symptoms and ability to discontinue/remain free of alprazolam will be compared among pregabalin and placebo treated groups. Hypothesis is that a greater proportion of subjects will be successful in discontinuing and remaining free from benzodiazepines who were treated with pregabalin as compared to subjects treated with placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects at Endpoint (Post Alprazolam Free Week 6 or Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] Post Alprazolam Free Week 1) Who Are Benzodiazepine Free","timeFrame":"Endpoint (Post Alprazolam Free Week 6 or LOCF Post Alprazolam Free Week 1)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pregabalin 75 mg to 300 mg PO BID","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo 75 mg to 300 mg PO BID","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2838"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Costa Rica","Czechia","France","Guatemala","Italy","Mexico","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A0081092&StudyName=Efficacy%20and%20safety%20of%20pregabalin%20vs%20placebo%20for%20Generalized%20Anxiety%20disorder%20%28GAD%29%20symptoms%20in%20subjects%20discontinuing%20benzodiazepine%20tr"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":56},"commonTop":["Anxiety","Headache","Dizziness","Nausea","Insomnia"]}}
