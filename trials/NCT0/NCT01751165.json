For corticosteroids, a prednisone dose of \\< 20 mg/day, or equivalent, is allowed. Inhaled, topical and intra-articular corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n* Administration or planned administration of a non-replicating vaccine within eight days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs (e.g. infliximab) within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during the study period.\n* Previous vaccination against varicella or HZ (either registered product or participation in a previous vaccine study).\n* Planned administration during the study of an HZ or varicella vaccine (including an investigational or non-registered vaccine) other than the study vaccine.\n* History of HZ.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s).\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g. malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\] infection) or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (e.g. medications used during cancer chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders).\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C (99.5°F) for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Significant underlying illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would be expected to prevent completion of the study.\n* Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluations required by the study.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant during the entire treatment period and for two months after completion of the vaccination series, or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential).","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50
