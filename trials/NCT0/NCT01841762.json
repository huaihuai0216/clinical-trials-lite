Patients will be in the study for 5 1/2 months, 4 months of which they will receive macitentan, 10 mg, once daily.\n\nThe primary objectives are to demonstrate the final content validity of the PAH SYMPACT instrument, to demonstrate the psychometric characteristics of reliability and construct validity of the PAH-SYMPACT instrument, and to demonstrate the ability of the PAH SYMPACT instrument to detect change. The secondary objective is to assess the safety of macitentan in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The exploratory objective is to explore the effects of macitentan on PAH symptoms and their impact (as measured by the PAH-SYMPACT) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Development and Refinement of the Patient-reported Outcome Measure of Symptoms and Their Impact in PAH (the PAH-SYMPACT)","timeFrame":"From Screening Visit (Day -14) to End of Treatment (EOT) Visit (Visit 4, Week 16)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Macitentan","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":81,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29705220"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":49,"n":284},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Headache","Dyspnoea","Cough","Nasal congestion"]}}
