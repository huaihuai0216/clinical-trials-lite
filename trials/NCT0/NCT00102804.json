Tumor assessment must occur between Cycle 4 (Day 1) of induction therapy and the date of randomization. This response does not have to be confirmed in order for the participant to be randomized. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans and ultrasounds may not be used for lesion measurements for response determination.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* With the exception of those chemotherapies listed as inclusion criterion, participants will not be included if they have received prior systemic anticancer therapy (including adjuvant early-stage treatment for NSCLC) or any systemic treatment for any other cancer.\n* Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.\n* Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures.\n* A serious concomitant systemic disorder that would compromise the participant's ability to complete the study.\n* A serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months, angina, or heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or IV.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time","description":"PFS time was the elapsed time from the date of randomization to the first date of objective progression of disease or death from any cause.
