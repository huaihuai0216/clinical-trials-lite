The approach of this study is to reduce the risk of systemic infections by avoiding intraoperative steroids (another class of immunosuppressive drugs) given in combination with basiliximab, cyclosporine and steroids in pediatric de novo liver transplant recipients. The treatment is compared to the same treatment regimen including intraoperative steroids with respect to rejection episodes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With at Least One Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR) Episode, Graft Loss or Death Within the First Three Months Post-transplantation","timeFrame":"3 months after treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"With Intraoperative Steroids","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Without Intraoperative Steroids","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":39},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Pyrexia","Pleural effusion","Flatulence","Hypomagnesaemia"]}}
