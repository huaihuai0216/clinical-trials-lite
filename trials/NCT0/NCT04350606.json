However, participants previously treated with rATG may enroll.\n* Previous history of stem cell transplantation.\n* Previous administration with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local requirement) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of investigational product used in this study (whichever is longer).\n* Baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (e.g., baseline corrected QT \\[QTc\\] interval \\>450 msec, complete left bundle branch block \\[LBBB\\], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular \\[AV\\] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is \\>450 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.\n* Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"2 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Hematologic Response at Week 12","description":"Hematologic response was considered to be \"effective\" when 2 or more of the following criteria were met: absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to (\\>=) 500 per microliters, platelet count \\>=20,000 per microliters and reticulocyte count \\>=60,000 per microliters was observed.
