Patients will be randomized to receive morphine plus saline (a placebo) or morphine plus ketamine before the WCP. The second time the patient is scheduled for WCP (no less than 24 hours), patients will be crossed over to receive the treatment they did not receive the first time. It is hypothesized that patients who receive the combination of morphine and ketamine will have better pain control during the procedure than patients who just receive morphine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Intensity","timeFrame":"Immediately after the wound care procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Morphine Plus Ketamine","deltaMin":3.1,"sd":0.99},{"arm":"Morphine Plus Saline","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":0.92}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21436683"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["strange sensations"]}}
