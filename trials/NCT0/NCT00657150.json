This does not include Gilberts syndrome or hepatitis A with complete recovery.\n* Active liver disease or liver disease decreasing survival (e.g, acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \\>3 x ULN.\n* Known severe renal insufficiency (CrCl \\<30 ml/min). Note: CrCl should be calculated only if serum creatinine is elevated or renal insufficiency is suspected. See Appendix 10.1 for calculation.\n* Elevated creatinine that, in the investigators opinion, contraindicates venography.\n* Treatment with anticoagulants, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, abciximab, aspirin \\>162.5 mg/day or NSAID with t 1/2 \\>12 hours within 7 days prior to hip replacement surgery OR anticipated need while the patient is receiving study medication and prior to 24 hours after the last administration of any blinded study medication (COX-2 selective inhibitors are allowed).\n* Anticipated required use of intermittent pneumatic compression and electric stimulation of lower limb.\n* Pre-menopausal women (last menstruation within 1 year prior to signing informed consent) who:\n\n  * Are pregnant.\n  * Are nursing.\n  * Are of child-bearing potential and are NOT practicing acceptable methods of birth control, or do NOT plan to continue practicing an acceptable method throughout the study. Acceptable methods of birth control include intrauterine device; oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives and surgical sterility.\n* Known allergy to radio opaque contrast media.\n* History of thrombocytopenia, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or a platelet count \\<100,000 cells/microliter at randomisation.\n* Allergy to heparins or dabigatran etexilate.\n* Active malignant disease or current cytostatic treatment. Patients should be disease free for at least 5 years.\n* Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days of randomisation.\n* Leg amputee.\n* Known alcohol or drug abuse which would interfere with completion of the study.\n* Contraindications to enoxaparin.\n* Previous participation in this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
