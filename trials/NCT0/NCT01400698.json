An open, phase III study involving 17 centers in France.\n\nThe study enrolled children who have completed 3 or 2 years of treatment and at least one year of post treatment observation in the Sponsor Studies GF 4001 (Safety and Efficacy of Saizen in the Treatment of Young Children Born with Severe IUGR) or GF 6283 (Effect of Intermittent versus Continuous Saizen Therapy in Young Children Born with Severe IUGR), respectively.\n\nDetailed description: Serious IUGR is a syndrome characterized by low birth length and weight for gestational age (less than 10 percentile). The secretion of growth hormone in response to provocative stimuli (e.g. arginine, insulin) is normal in these children. Apart from low birth weight, children born with IUGR may have minor or major malformations.\n\nA catch-up period with a supraphysiological growth velocity generally occurs during the first 6 to 24 months of life in 80 to 90 percent (%) of these children. This generally allows them to reach normal height. That means that conversely, approximately 10 to 20% of children do maintain a statural handicap. Puberty occurs at a normal age and the retardation in bone maturation present during the first years of life disappears very quickly. This leads to short adult stature in subjects who have not shown spontaneous catch-up during the first years of life. A safe and effective means of promoting growth without accelerating the timing or tempo of puberty would therefore be desirable.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Final Height","timeFrame":"One year after final height was attained up to 10.6 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Non-Final Height: Not Treated","deltaMin":145.9,"sd":16.08},{"arm":"Non-Final Height: Treated","deltaMin":150.06,"sd":12.89},{"arm":"Final Height: Not Treated","deltaMin":153.27,"sd":8.71},{"arm":"Final Height: Treated","deltaMin":155.59,"sd":8.38}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["16772718","9641731"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":32},"commonTop":["Pharyngitis","Bronchitis","Headache","Gastroenteritis","Arthralgia"]}}
