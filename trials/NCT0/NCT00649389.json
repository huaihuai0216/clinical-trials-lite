A history of New York Heart Association Class I or II CHF may be exclusionary at the discretion of the investigator.\n* History of secondary hypertension including renal disease, pheochromocytoma, or Cushing's syndrome.\n* Uncorrected coarctation of the aorta, bilateral renal artery stenosis, or unilateral renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney.\n* Evidence of symptomatic resting bradycardia.\n* Evidence of hemodynamically significant cardiac valvular disease.\n* Presence of heart block greater than first degree atrioventricular block, chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter.\n* Uncontrolled Type I or Type II diabetes defined as HbA1c \\>9.0%. Diabetics must have documentation of HbA1c within 6 months of the Screening Visit. Undocumented subjects must have their HbA1c assessed prior to randomization. Note: Subjects with Type I or Type II diabetes controlled with insulin, diet or oral hypoglycemic agents on a stable dose for at least 30 days may be included.\n* Evidence of liver disease as indicated by ALT and AST and/or total bilirubin \\>3 times the upper limit of normal.\n* Severe renal insufficiency defined as a creatinine clearance (based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula) of \\<30 mL/min.\n* Clinically significant laboratory elevations at Visit 1 that compromise subject safety, based on the investigator's judgment. Consideration should take into account the potential laboratory effects of the component blinded therapies.\n* Positive for any one of the following tests: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (confirmed by radio immunobinding assay, RIBA) or HIV antibody (confirmed by western blot assay).\n* Subjects with malignancy during the past 2 years excluding squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.\n* Known allergy to any of the medications used in the study.\n* Subjects who require or are taking any concomitant medication, which may interfere with the objectives of the study (Refer to Section 5.2 for a listing of excluded medications).\n* Pregnant or lactating females.\n* Current history of drug or alcohol abuse.\n* A subject with any medical condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator would jeopardize the evaluation of efficacy or safety and/or constitute a significant safety risk to the subject.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Seated Diastolic Blood Pressure (SeDBP).","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-17.8","spread":"9.47"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-16.5","spread":"10.84"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-14.8","spread":"8.78"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-21.5","spread":"10.25"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects Who Reached Blood Pressure Goal (<140/90 mmHg; <130/80 mmHg for Subjects With Diabetes, Chronic Renal Disease, or Chronic Cardiovascular Disease)by 12 Weeks","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"46.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"34.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"64.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Mean 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure From Baseline to Week 12 or Early Termination","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-13.9","spread":"8.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-14.5","spread":"8.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-10.7","spread":"7.46"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-18.0","spread":"8.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-23.5","spread":"11.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-23.9","spread":"13.10"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-18.5","spread":"10.67"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-30.3","spread":"13.85"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Seated Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline to Week 12","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-31.1","spread":"15.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-31.2","spread":"18.58"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-28.9","spread":"15.12"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-38.1","spread":"17.40"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":596},"commonTop":["dizziness","headache","edema peripheral","fatigue","upper respiratory tract infection"]}}}
