The Total Score is the sum of the scores for all 18 items, and could range from 0 (no impairment) to 54 (maximal impairment).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.3","spread":"8.86"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.2","spread":"12.06"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12.3","spread":"9.84"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"13.2","spread":"10.29"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"5.1","spread":"10.29"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":49},"commonTop":["headache","decreased appetite","Insomnia","abdominal pain upper","fatigue"]}}}
