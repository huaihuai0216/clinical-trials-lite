Giving radiation therapy in different ways and combining it with chemotherapy before surgery may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen combined with chemotherapy with or without surgery is more effective for head and neck cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare two different radiation therapy regimens combined with cisplatin with or without surgery in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (Percentage of Participants Alive)","timeFrame":"From randomization to last follow-up. Follow-up schedule from end of treatment: 6-8 weeks, every 3 mo. for 2 yr., then every 6 mo. for 3 yr., then yearly. Maximum follow-up at time of analysis was 6.5 years.
