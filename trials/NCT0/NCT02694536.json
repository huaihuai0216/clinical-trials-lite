Questions 1 to 28 were assessed on a 4-point scale from 1 (\"no/not at all\") to 4 (\"very much\") where higher scores represented worse symptoms. Questions 29 and 30 were assessed on a 7-point scale from 1 (\"very poor\") to 7 (\"excellent\") where higher scores represented better functioning. Item scores over the study period were averaged among all participants across all visits for which data were available.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.96","spread":"0.758"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.03","spread":"0.802"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.50","spread":"0.696"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.87","spread":"0.699"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.21","spread":"0.501"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.82","spread":"0.803"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.73","spread":"0.798"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.38","spread":"0.608"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.88","spread":"0.771"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.05","spread":"0.697"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.74","spread":"0.699"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.05","spread":"0.774"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.70","spread":"0.730"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.48","spread":"0.679"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.10","spread":"0.414"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.51","spread":"0.723"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.27","spread":"0.496"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.07","spread":"0.689"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.69","spread":"0.814"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.49","spread":"0.638"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.97","spread":"0.716"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.10","spread":"0.773"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.75","spread":"0.707"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.67","spread":"0.658"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.44","spread":"0.543"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.59","spread":"0.680"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.62","spread":"0.772"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.32","spread":"0.655"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.44","spread":"1.314"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.38","spread":"1.346"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Died","description":"The percentage of participants who died from any cause was reported to the nearest integer.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"73","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"OS was defined as the time from start of treatment to time of death from any cause.
