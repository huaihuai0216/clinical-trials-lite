Children presenting to nutritional programs in Burkina Faso who meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to a single dose of oral azithromycin or a 7-day course of amoxicillin (standard of care) upon admission into the program. All enrolled children will receive ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF). Enrolled children will be followed at each weekly clinic follow-up visit up to 8 weeks following admission. Data on anthropometric indicators, vital status, and adverse events will be collected during follow-up. Nutritional recovery over the 8-week study period will be compared by arm.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Weight Gain","timeFrame":"8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Azithromycin","deltaMin":1.8,"sd":2.1},{"arm":"Amoxicillin","deltaMin":2,"sd":2.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Burkina Faso"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36509053","35895362","34583344","33879263"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":161},"commonTop":["fever","Diarrhea","Vomiting","skin rash","constipation"]}}
