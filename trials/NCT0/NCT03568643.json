The greater the index, the more diverse the gut microbiota. An index of 0 indicates a community that only has one species. A negative change indicates a decrease in diversity and a positive change indicates an increase in diversity.\n\nThe Simpson's Diversity Index is a measure of diversity which takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. As species richness and evenness increase, so diversity increases. The value ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 represents infinite diversity and 0, no diversity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.0","spread":"2.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.1","spread":"3.5"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.6","spread":"4.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.3","spread":"5.6"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.5","spread":"2.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.3","spread":"2.9"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.5","spread":"4.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.1","spread":"5.8"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":161},"commonTop":["fever","Diarrhea","Vomiting","skin rash","constipation"]}}}
