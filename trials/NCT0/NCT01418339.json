This scale consisted of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms, and an impairment ranking. Ratings were made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics, each including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS TTS was the summation of the severity scores of motor and vocal tics. The TTS ranged from 0 (none) to 50 (severe) with a higher score represent more severe symptoms (greater reduction from baseline for greater improvement).
