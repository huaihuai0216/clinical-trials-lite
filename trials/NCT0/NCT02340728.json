The investigators will also look at the safety of the combination treatment, and see which treatment is better. In either case, the second stent will be placed inside the existing stent as is done in standard practice when treating a blocked stent for the first time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Failure","timeFrame":"180 days","effectByArm":[],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mskcc.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":13},"commonTop":["Anemia","Hyperglycemia","Hypoalbuminemia","Hypocalcemia","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
