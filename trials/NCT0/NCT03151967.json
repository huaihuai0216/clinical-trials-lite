LACTIN-V is a vaginal applicator that contains Lactobacillus crispatus, an organism found naturally in the vaginas of healthy women. Lactobacillus bacteria are thought to help prevent other bacteria such as E. coli from causing UTI's. This is a double blind study comparing active product to a placebo (inactive vaginal applicator without any medicine).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"UTI Incidence as Described Below, Over the 16 Week Study Period Following Randomization, in the LACTIN-V Treatment Group (Group A) as Compared to the Placebo Group (Group B).","timeFrame":"Week 2-18","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Applicator With LACTIN-V Treatment","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Applicator With Placebo","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":14},"commonTop":["Reproductive system and breast disorders","Infections and Infestations","Renal and urinary disorders","Gastrointestinal disorders","Nervous system disorders"]}}
