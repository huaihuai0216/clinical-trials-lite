The patients used a Likert scale from 0 to 10 to assess symptoms with 10 representing the most severe symptom and zero no symptom. The score for each individual symptom was combined into one overall symptom score for the 7 days of baseline (days 1-7) and a separate score for the 7 days of treatment (days 8-14). Therefore, a maximum 7-day score was 70 and a minimum of 0 was possible.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.33","spread":"4.933"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27","spread":"5.568"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.71","spread":"4.030"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"22.43","spread":"5.062"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.09","spread":"8.043"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28.36","spread":"11.59"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9","spread":"0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":"0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.88","spread":"7.191"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.75","spread":"13.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.75","spread":"9.032"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28.25","spread":"19.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.67","spread":"2.517"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"33","spread":"10.82"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.25","spread":"31.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"42","spread":"26.75"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":"5.657"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28","spread":"0"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Body Temperature in Long COVID-19 Patients","description":"Body temperature will be measured twice daily by thermometer in degrees Fahrenheit.
