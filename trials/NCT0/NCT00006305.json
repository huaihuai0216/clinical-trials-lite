Diabetic patients who are being treated with insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs will be eligible as well as diabetic patients treated with diet and exercise alone provided that a diagnosis of diabetes can be confirmed by record review or that a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) greater than 125/mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) can be obtained. The determination of suitability for BARI 2D will be made by a physician-investigator at each participating institution on clinical grounds at the time of coronary angiography.\n\nSignificant CAD will be defined as at least one stenosis greater than 50%. Angina and ischemia will be assessed by use of patient self-report, physician examination, and appropriate diagnostic measures including exercise myocardial perfusion imaging, exercise echocardiography, exercise electrocardiography, and IV dipyridamole or adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging or invasively by doppler or pressure wire. Objective documentation of myocardial ischemia includes any of the following:\n\n1. Exercise or pharmacologically-induced:\n\n   1. Greater than or equal to 1 mm of horizontal or downsloping ST depression or elevation for greater than or equal to 60-80 milliseconds after the end of the QRS complex\n   2. Myocardial perfusion defect\n   3. Myocardial wall motion abnormality\n2. Stabilized, prior acute coronary syndrome with CK-MB or troponin elevation or with new, greater than or equal to 0.5 mm ST depression or elevation, or T wave inversion of greater than or equal to 3 mm in 2 contiguous ECG leads\n3. Doppler or pressure wire showing coronary flow reserve (CFR) less than 2.0 or fractional flow reserve (FFR) less than 0.75\n\nAmong patients without documented ischemia, only patients with stenosis greater than or equal to 70% presenting with classic anginal symptoms will be eligible for randomization.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"25 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With All-Cause Mortality","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"80","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"75","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"80","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"81","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Death, Myocardial Infarction, or Stroke","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"145","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"121","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"143","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"140","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":230,"n":592},"commonTop":["Pitting Edema","Lower Extremity Ulcer","Laser Therapy for Macular Edema","Bone Fracture"]}}}
