The KDQOL is a validated, kidney disease-specific measure of health-related quality of life. For study TRCA-301E, and the parent study TRCA-301, the 10-question Item 3 of the KDQOL, also known as the SF-36 Physical Function subscale, was selected to measure physical functioning and is referenced herein as the KDQOL-PFD. The KDQOL-PFD was chosen as a patient-reported outcome measurement to evaluate the effects of TRC101 on daily activities that may be adversely affected by loss of muscle caused by metabolic acidosis. The minimum score for each of the 10 questions is 0 (physical activity highly limited) and the maximum is 100 (physical activity not limited). The total KDQOL-PFD score is calculated by adding the scores for all 10 questions, for a minimum and maximum possible total KDQOL-PFD score of 0 or 100, respectively.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.42","spread":"2.201"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.71","spread":"2.268"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Duration of Repeated Chair Stand Test at the End of Treatment","description":"Change from baseline in the duration of repeated chair stand test at the end of treatment (Week 52).
