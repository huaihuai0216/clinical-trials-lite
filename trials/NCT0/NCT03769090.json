Oral corticosteroid/SCS use (any dose and any indication) within 6 weeks before Visit 1\n3. Chronic use of oral corticosteroids (OCS, ≥3 weeks use in 3 months prior to Visit 1)\n4. Having received any marketed (e.g., omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab) or investigational biologic within 3 months or any other prohibited medication\n5. Current smokers, former smokers with \\>10 pack-years history, or former smokers who stopped smoking \\<6 months before Visit 1 (including all forms of tobacco, e-cigarettes \\[vaping\\], and marijuana)\n6.
