Baseline value is the average of the values from screening, randomization and immediately pre-dose.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.945","spread":"0.905"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.524","spread":"1.331"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.083","spread":"0.472"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.911","spread":"1.229"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.895","spread":"1.395"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.350","spread":"0.784"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.093","spread":"1.3402"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.220","spread":"1.0900"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.251","spread":"1.0800"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.536","spread":"1.1599"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.672","spread":"1.1836"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-2.471","spread":"0.9200"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.070","spread":"1.3832"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.075","spread":"0.5705"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.530","spread":"0.1726"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.876","spread":"0.8448"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.419","spread":"1.3042"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.088","spread":"0.4541"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.843","spread":"1.2452"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.868","spread":"1.4078"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.262","spread":"0.7048"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.146","spread":"1.4208"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.182","spread":"1.1096"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.147","spread":"0.9681"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.427","spread":"1.3136"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.634","spread":"1.1628"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-2.205","spread":"1.0870"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.106","spread":"1.4461"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.698","spread":"1.2056"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.370","spread":"0.1471"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":42,"n":232},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache"]}}}
