Prior research suggests that smokers who switch to very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes experience reduced addiction to nicotine and are more likely to quit smoking. Currently, the most common method for smokers to reduce their nicotine intake is to reduce their number of cigarettes per day (CPD). No research has compared reducing smokers' nicotine intake by switching to VLNC cigarettes vs by reducing CPD with regard to decreasing dependence or quitting; thus the investigators will examine the two strategies by randomizing smokers to 1) switch to VLNC cigarettes or 2) reduce CPD. In addition, all smokers will use the nicotine patch to help them reduce their nicotine intake.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Feasibility as Indicated by Self-reported Adherence to Study Cigarettes.","timeFrame":"Assessed weekly during the 4 week reduction period after the baseline week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Switch to VLNC Cigarettes","deltaMin":7.1,"sd":0.03},{"arm":"Reduce CPD","deltaMin":7.3,"sd":0.03}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31106492","31867643","32658536"],"seeAlso":["https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1922&context=graddis"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":36},"commonTop":["Skin irritation","Mood","Mild muscle ache/spasm","Cough/Mucus","Nausea"]}}
