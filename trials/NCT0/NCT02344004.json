A negative culture result reflected a negative culture result for all sputum samples collected at each visit. Participants met the primary endpoint of culture conversion by Month 6 if they had 3 consecutive monthly MAC-negative sputum cultures during the first 6 months of the study. A participant needed to achieve the first of 3 consecutive negative sputum cultures (that defined culture conversion) by Month 4 in order to meet the primary endpoint by Month 6. Each participant in the intent to treat (ITT) population (ie, all randomized participants) was classified as either a converter or non-converter by Month 6.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"159","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"102","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Achieving Durable Culture Conversion Through 3 Months Off Treatment in the LAI + MDR Arm Compared to the MDR Arm Alone","description":"Sputum specimens were collected at screening, baseline (Day 1), during treatment, and at Months 1, 3, 6, and 12 months off treatment.

Converters with missing broth or Agar sputum culture result after Month 6 up to 3 months off treatment were considered as not achieving culture conversion with durability except those participants who are unable to produce sputum despite reasonable efforts, as reported by source documentation.

The SGRQ is a self-administered questionnaire that has been validated in participants with airways disease, specifically in participants with bronchiectasis. The SGRQ assesses health-related quality of life in participants with chronic pulmonary disease by evaluating 3 health domains: symptoms (distress caused by respiratory symptoms); activity (effects of disturbances on mobility and physical activity); and impacts (the effect of disease on factors such as employment, personal control of one's health, and need for medication). A composite total score is derived as the sum of domain scores for symptoms, activity, and impact (0 = best possible score and 100 = worst possible score). A within patient reduction from baseline in score of 4 units is generally recognized as a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36.555","spread":"21.3777"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"38.409","spread":"21.5753"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38.715","spread":"22.3559"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.368","spread":"23.6868"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.009","spread":"13.4128"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.312","spread":"11.6216"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":45,"n":223},"commonTop":["Dysphonia","Cough","Dyspnoea","Haemoptysis","Fatigue"]}}}
