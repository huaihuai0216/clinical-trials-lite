Subject is 6 - 12 years old, inclusive at screening and randomization. 2. At least one of the subject's parents/legal guardians must give written informed consent, including privacy authorization, prior to study participation. The subject will provide informed assent prior to study participation.\n\n  3\\. Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive, or combined presentation) at screening established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviews DSM-5 criteria and confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) at screening.\n\n  4\\. Subject is currently on a treatment regimen of a methylphenidate formulation within the approved labeled dose range for ADHD for at least 6 weeks prior to Day -7 with the same dose level for at least 1 week immediately prior to Day -7. Note: if any doses of methylphenidate were missed during the week prior to Day-7, the subject's eligibility will be discussed with the Medical Monitor.\n\n  5\\. In the opinion of the investigator, methylphenidate well tolerated and clinically effective based on clinical assessment and informant interview, as well as, review of available medical records. Note: The ADHD Rating Scale Version IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) (ADHD-RS-IV HV) will be administered at Screening by the investigator to inform clinical evaluation.\n\n  6\\. Subject is male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female. 7. Subject, if female, must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and if ≥ 8 years of age must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening.\n\n  8\\. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must practice true abstinence (consistent with lifestyle) and must agree to remain abstinent or agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of birth control, from the time of informed consent/assent to at least 14 days after the last dose of the study drug has been taken.\n\n  9\\. Subject must be in general good health (defined as the absence of any clinically relevant abnormalities as determined by the investigator) based on screening physical and neurological examinations, medical history, and clinical laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Note: If any of the hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis results are not within the laboratory's reference range, then the subject can be included only if the investigator determines the deviations to be not clinically relevant.\n\n  10\\.

Intermittent use of bronchodilators is not exclusionary. Subjects who have a history of requiring persistent asthma treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to randomization.\n\n  7\\. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease, or a history of a clinically significant abnormality of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hepatic, or renal systems, or a disorder or history of a condition (eg, malabsorption, gastrointestinal surgery) that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion. Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to the subject or the study results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the medical monitor should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if controlled) must be discussed with the medical monitor during screening.\n\n  8\\. Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECGs, which in the investigator's opinion is clinically significant.
