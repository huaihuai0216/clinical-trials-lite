Total SANS scores range from 0-100. The SANS is comprised of 5 subscores: Affective Flattening or Blunting (score range 0-35), Alogia (score range 0-20), Avolition-Apathy (score range 0-15), Anhedonia-Asociality (score range 0-20), and Attention (0-10). For each scale, the higher the score the more prominent the negative symptoms were. The slopes were obtained by plotting the group SANS total score mean for treatment vs. placebo on Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 and performing a random slopes model.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-.46","spread":".29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-.41","spread":".31"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}}
