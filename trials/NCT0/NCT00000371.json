To determine if negative symptoms and cognitive function improve over time, if these improvements meaningfully impact quality of life factors, if they correlate with markers of neuronal function, and if subpopulations can be identified according to response.\n\nDysfunction of glutamatergic neuronal systems has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based on the finding that non-competitive inhibitors of the NMDA receptor can reproduce in normals the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Furthermore, glutamatergic dysfunction may alter forebrain dopaminergic neuronal activity, a system central to the antipsychotic action of typical neuroleptics. It is believed that enhancing NMDA receptor function by systemic treatment with D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor, will reduce symptoms in schizophrenia.\n\nSixty schizophrenic outpatients with prominent, primary negative symptoms are treated with antipsychotic medication and are randomly assigned to D-cycloserine or placebo for a 6-month, fixed-dose trial. The primary outcome measure is the total score on the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). A neuropsychological battery, which emphasizes tests sensitive to prefrontal cortical function, is administered. Blood is obtained at several time points and CSF is obtained at Week 8 for assay of concentrations of D-cycloserine, glutamate, HVA, and 5HIAA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 4, Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"D-Cycloserine","deltaMin":-0.46,"sd":0.29},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.41,"sd":0.31}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["15502972"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
