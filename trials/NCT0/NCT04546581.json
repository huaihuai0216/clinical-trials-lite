Trials will involve sites around the world strategically chosen to ensure rapid enrollment. This trial will compare hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) with matched placebo, when added to standard of care (SOC), for preventing further disease progression and mortality related to COVID-19. SOC will include remdesivir unless it is contraindicated for an individual patient.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Ordinal Outcome Scale - Day 7","timeFrame":"7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention Group","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Denmark","Greece","Japan","Nigeria","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36216961","35093205","33715160"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":301},"commonTop":["Dyspnoea","Pyrexia","Respiratory Distress","Chills","Respiratory Failure"]}}
