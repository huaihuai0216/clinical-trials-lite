The researchers hypothesize that these regimens will have a positive effect on post transplant engraftment and the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease.\n\nRegimen A2 has replaced Regimen A in this study. Two patients were treated on Regimen A but did not have evidence of initial engraftment thus triggering the stopping rule for that arm of this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients Who Experienced Grade 3-5 Treatment Related Toxicity","timeFrame":"1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RIC Bu/Flu (A) (Discontinued)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"MA Bu/Cy (B)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"RIC Cy/Flu/TBI (A2)","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":3},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Bacterial Infection, Blood","Pneumonia","Viral Infection, Pulmonary","Viral Infection, Gastrointestinal"]}}
