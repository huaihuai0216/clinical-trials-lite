The participants were encouraged to exercise to exhaustion with progressive 2-minutes increments in the power output during the test. VO2peak was obtained when participants reached volitional exhaustion and met at least one of the following criteria: plateau in oxygen consumption despite increase in workload, rating of perceived exertion \\>18, Respiratory exchange ratio \\> 1.10 and peak heart rate within 10 beats of age predicted maximum. .
