The investigators propose to examine whether the adrenal gland produces the majority of androgens during puberty by studying the differences in androgen responses to adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) administration in normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) girls ages 7-18. The investigators' analyses will compare steroid changes before and 60 min after ACTH administration in NW and OB girls.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"17-hydroxyprogesterone Response to ACTH","timeFrame":"0 and 60 minutes after ACTH administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Early Puberty Group","deltaMin":2.4,"sd":0.5},{"arm":"Late Puberty Group","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":0.8},{"arm":"Total Number","deltaMin":3.1,"sd":0.6}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
