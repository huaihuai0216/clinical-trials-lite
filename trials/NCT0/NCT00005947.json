All subjects must have stable or rising PSA.\n* Tumor progression after hormonal therapy.\n* Hormonal therapy consisting of castration by orchiectomy or LHRH agonists for treatment of prostate cancer. Castration levels of testosterone (\\< 50 ng/dL) must be documented for all subjects including subjects who underwent orchiectomy as therapy for cancer of the prostate.\n* A subject is eligible if he initially responded to antiandrogen withdrawal (\\> 25% decrease in PSA) but at the time of registration demonstrated tumor progression. A subject is eligible if he failed to respond to antiandrogen withdrawal.\n* Subjects have no cancer-related pain and do not regularly require analgesics for cancer-related pain.\n* ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.\n* Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks.\n* Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function.\n\nExclusion Criteria include:\n\n* Visceral organ metastases (e.g., liver, lung, brain) or cytologically positive effusions (e.g., pleural effusions or ascites).\n* Metastatic disease expected to be in need of radiation therapy within 4 months.\n* Concurrent therapy with experimental agents.\n* Systemic corticosteroids at doses greater than 40 mg hydrocortisone per day for any reason other than treatment of prostate cancer within the previous 6 months without prior approval.\n\nPlease note that there are additional eligibility criteria. The study center will determine if you meet all of the criteria.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to Objective Disease Progression","description":"The time to objective disease progression in patients with asymptomatic metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated with APC8015 (sipuleucel-T).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival","description":"Overall Survival","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.4","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":82},"commonTop":["Chills","Fatigue","Pyrexia","Back pain","Nausea"]}}}
