Also, this study will consolidate the information regarding diagnostic performance of fluciclovine PET/CT in a large number of prospectively followed patients at several centres in the UK and assess the effect of PSA level on the likelihood of detecting cancer lesions by 18F-fluciclovine","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Impact on Patient Treatment /Management","timeFrame":"1 month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"18F-Fluciclovine PET CT","deltaMin":66,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37121865","32068113","31624865"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":104},"commonTop":["HEADACHE","APPLICATION SITE REACTION","FATIGUE","BLOOD CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE INCREASED","DIZZINESS"]}}
