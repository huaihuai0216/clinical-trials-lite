The period baseline FEV1 was the average of the FEV1 value measured in the clinic at 50 and 15 min prior to the study drug administration in that period.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.48","spread":"0.014"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.50","spread":"0.014"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.38","spread":"0.014"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.43","spread":"0.014"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"1.47","spread":"0.014"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":86},"commonTop":[]}}}
