Drugs used in chemotherapy, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Steroid therapy decreases inflammation. Combining chemotherapy and steroid therapy with immunoglobulin may be effective in treating abnormal muscle movement associated with neuroblastoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Responders","timeFrame":"Changes from baseline to 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Chemotherapy, Immunoglobulin Therapy)","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Chemotherapy, Observation)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0044"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":104,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29376112"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":26},"commonTop":["11400-Agitation","58700-Nystagmus","87900-Vomiting(targeted toxicity)","44800-Infections and infestations - Other specify","13200-Anemia"]}}
