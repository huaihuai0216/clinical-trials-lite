Randomized clinical trials will provide local data on the safety of the test drugs, and on putative marker mutations of the development of resistance to ACT. The study will involve three centers, namely, Banso (Guinea-Savannah region), Limbe(Littoral Forest), and Garoua(Sahel-Savannah). The trial will compare the efficacy and safety of Amodiaquine(AQ)-Artesunate(Art) with CoartemÂ®(Artemether-Lumefantrine). Drug efficacy will be determined using a WHO standardized 28-day protocol. Safety will be monitored through clinical examination and biochemical and hematological indices. Molecular markers of artemisinin resistance will be investigated by molecular sequencing and comparison of parasite profiles of the PfATP6 gene in drug failure cases, . Recrudescences or re-infections will be assessed by analysis of the msp1 and msp2 genes. The impact of these combinations on generation of gametocytes will be determined from gametocyte carriage rates measured by microscopy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cure Rate on Day 28","timeFrame":"Day 0 - 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1 Artemether-Lumefantrine AL","deltaMin":197,"sd":null},{"arm":"2 Amodiaquine-Artesunate AQ-AS","deltaMin":603,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":">0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":204},"commonTop":["Leucopenia","Anorexia","Lymphopenia","Abdominal pain","Diarrhea"]}}
