Intravitreal anti-inflammatory Therapy (MERIT) Trial will compare the relative efficacy and safety of intravitreal methotrexate, intravitreal ranibizumab, and the intravitreal dexamethasone implant for the treatment of uveitic macular edema persisting or reoccurring after an intravitreal corticosteroid injection. MERIT is a parallel design (1:1:1), randomized comparative trial with an anniversary close-out after 6 months of follow-up. The primary outcome is percent change in central subfield thickness from the baseline OCT measurement to the 12 week visit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Baseline Central Subfield Thickness Observed at 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"At 12-week visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ozurdex (0.7 mg Dexamethasone Pellet) Delivered Via Intravitreal Injection","deltaMin":0.65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intravitreal Methotrexate 400 µg in 0.1 mL 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution, Preservative-free","deltaMin":0.88,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intravitreal Ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0.5 mg in 0.05 mL","deltaMin":0.79,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.012"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","India","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37318415"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":65},"commonTop":["Post injection IOP increase >=30 mmHg","Eye pain","Ocular hypertension","Uveitis","Surgery to control IOP"]}}
