Cytarabine is the most commonly used drug to treat these patients. This study will determine if there is benefit by combining clofarabine with cytarabine. Patients will be randomized to receive up to 3 cycles of treatment with either placebo in combination with cytarabine or clofarabine in combination with cytarabine. Randomization was stratified by remission status following the first induction regimen (no remission \\[i.e., CR1 = refractory\\] or remission \\<6 months vs CR1 = remission ≥6 months). CR1 is defined as remission after first pre-study induction regimen. The safety and tolerability of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine and cytarabine alone will be monitored throughout the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival - Overall and by Calculated Strata (CSR 7-April-11)","timeFrame":"Day 1 (randomization) up to approximately 4 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Clofarabine (IV Formulation) and Cytarabine (FAS)","deltaMin":6.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo and Cytarabine (FAS)","deltaMin":6.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Clofarabine and Cytarabine - In Stratum < 6 Months","deltaMin":5.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo and Cytarabine - In Stratum < 6 Months","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Clofarabine and Cytarabine In Stratum >= 6 Months","deltaMin":8.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo and Cytarabine In Stratum >= 6 Months","deltaMin":7.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9951"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.4674"},{"comp":"OG004 vs OG005","p":"0.3963"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"55 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":57,"countries":["United States","Canada","France","Germany","Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22585697"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":97,"n":161},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Oedema peripheral","Constipation","Vomiting"]}}
