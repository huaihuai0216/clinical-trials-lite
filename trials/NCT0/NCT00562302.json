Suspicious nodules observed by CT scan are defined as non-calcified masses with convex borders, not known to be stable. Suspicious nodules can also be defined as masses demonstrating opacity on chest x-ray that are suspicious by radiographic or clinical means and require biopsy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with radiological findings of bullous emphysema located in the area of the anticipated biopsy and biopsy needle track;\n* Patients who cannot tolerate mild sedation, possibly secondary to poor respiratory status;\n* Female patients who are pregnant. Note: patients of childbearing potential must have a serum or urine pregnancy test no more than one week prior to the biopsy procedure, and be instructed not to have unprotected sexual intercourse after the test until the biopsy procedure is completed.\n* Patients who are uncooperative or cannot follow instructions.\n* Patients who are currently enrolled in another IDE or IND clinical investigation that has not completed the required follow-up period.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Incidence Rate of Treatment Success","description":"Treatment success was defined as the absence of a pneumothorax at each of the three follow-up time periods (0-60 minutes, 24 hours and 30 days).","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"126","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"94","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Incidence of Chest Tube Placement","description":"A chest tube is the definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Ambulation","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.3","spread":"4.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.8","spread":"6.29"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Incidence of Hospital Admissions for Pneumothorax","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Incidence of Adverse Events Related to the Procedure and Device Effects","description":"Anticipated, device-related adverse events that were defined in the original protocol.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"74","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Additional Chest X-rays Needed","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"52","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Participants Discharged Beyond Hospital's Standard of Care","description":"Current standard of care for hospital discharge varies.
