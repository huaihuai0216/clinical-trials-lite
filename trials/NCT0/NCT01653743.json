Ovulation induction therapy will be undertaken with follitropin alfa. The primary objective is to show that MSJ-0011 is non-inferior to urinary hCG, as assessed by the ovulation rate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Ovulation Mid-luteal Serum Progesterone (P4) Level of Greater Than or Equal (>=) 5 Nanogram Per Milliliter (ng/mL) or Clinical Pregnancy","timeFrame":"Mid-luteal phase progesterone assessed (Day 5 to 10) or clinical pregnancy (Day 35 to 42) post hCG treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MSJ-0011","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"u-hCG","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":54},"commonTop":["Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","Ovarian cyst","Injection site erythema","Injection site pain","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
