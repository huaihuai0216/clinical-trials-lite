Secondary hypogonadal males between the ages of 18 and 65\n2. Men currently using topical testosterone products should wash-out for at least 7 days before Visit 1.\n3. All clinical laboratory tests within normal ranges (any clinically significant deviation of laboratory results will require approval of sponsor)\n4. Previously or concurrently diagnosed as having secondary hypogonadism and confirmed with morning testosterone level \\< 350 ng/dL for men age \\< 55 and \\< 300ng/dl for men age 55-65\n5.

Use of an injectable pelleted testosterone within 6 months prior to study (men currently on topical testosterone products may be enrolled in the study after a 7-day washout period).\n2. Use testosterone injection, spironolactone, cimetidine, Clomid, 5α-reductase inhibitors, hCG, androgen, estrogen, anabolic steroid, DHEA, or herbal hormone products during the study\n3.

Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the participant's ability to provide informed consent, comply with study instructions, possibly confound interpretation of study results, or endanger the participant if he took part in the study\n11.
