Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving sorafenib tosylate together with doxorubicin hydrochloride is more effective than sorafenib tosylate alone in treating liver cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Sorafenib Tosylate)","deltaMin":8.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Sorafenib Tosylate)","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.24"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":28,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":673,"countries":["United States","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35484400","31486832"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":71,"n":167},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Diarrhea","Abdominal pain","Platelet count decreased","Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome"]}}
