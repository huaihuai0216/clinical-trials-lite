If the subject has been amenorrheic for \\>or=6 months but \\<12 months they must have a serum FSH concentration of \\>or=50 mIU/mL and an estradiol concentration of \\<or=25 pg/mL. Surgical menopause is defined as bilateral oophorectomy.\n* MALES - subjects must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception during the study and for 3 months after study completion. This may include the following: condom + spermicide or condom + oral hormonal contraception\n* MALES - have a serum PSA of \\< or = 4.0 ng/mL or a negative prostate biopsy (no prostate cancer) within 6 months of evaluation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have, in the judgment of the Investigator, a clinically significant concurrent illness or psychological, familial, sociological, geographical or other concomitant condition that would not permit adequate follow-up and compliance with the study protocol\n* Have ALT/SGOT or AST/SGPT above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) without evidence of liver metastases and above 5 times the ULN in subjects with evidence of liver metastases\n* have alkaline phosphatase greater than 3 times ULN and/or total bilirubin levels above 2 mg/dL at baseline\n* have biologic agents or kinase inhibitors as part of their first line chemotherapy regimen including, but not limited to bevacizumab (Avastin), gefitinib (Nexavar) and erlotinib (Tarceva)\n* cardiovascular: uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure or angina\n* Pulmonary: Stage 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* positive screen for Hepatitis B consisting of HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen), unless subject was diagnosed \\> 10 years prior to enrollment and no evidence of active liver disease\n* currently taking testosterone, oxandrolone (Oxandrin), testosterone-like agents (such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, and other androgenic compounds including herbals), or antiandrogens; previous therapy with testosterone and testosterone-like agents is acceptable with a 30 day washout (if previous testosterone therapy was long term depot within the past 6 months, the site should contact the medical monitor for this study to determine appropriate washout period)\n* currently taking megestrol acetate (Megace), dronabinol (Marinol), medical marijuana (medical cannabis) or any prescription medication intended to increase appetite or treat unintentional weight loss\n* have a baseline stair climb time \\>or=30 seconds (mean of two stair climbs)\n* have active cancer, other than NSCLC or non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin, within the previous two years.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Physical Function","description":"Measure is the percentage of subjects at day 84 with stair climb power change \\>=10% from their baseline value.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Lean Body Mass","description":"Measure is the percentage of subjects at day 84 with lean body mass change \\>=0% from their baseline value.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.9","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":109,"n":165},"commonTop":["Anemia","Nausea","Neutropenia","Vomiting","Thrombocytopenia"]}}}
