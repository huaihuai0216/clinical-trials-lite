It covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings (Q1 and Q2), leisure (Q4, Q5, and Q6), school or holidays (Q7), personal relationships (Q3 and Q8), sleep (Q9) and treatment (Q10). Response categories include 0-not at all, 1-a little, 2-a lot, and 3-very much, and unanswered or not relevant responses scored as 0. The total DLQI score is calculated by adding the score of each question resulting in a maximum score of 30 (extremely large effect on participant's life) and a minimum score of 0 (no impact on participant's life) and a 4-point change from Baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference threshold. A negative change from Baseline indicates less impact of the skin problem on participant's life.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-7.50","spread":"2.121"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.88","spread":"5.436"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-5.54","spread":"5.153"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-5.57","spread":"5.482"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-8.50","spread":"2.121"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.88","spread":"4.549"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-5.72","spread":"6.066"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-5.68","spread":"7.326"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-8.00","spread":"1.414"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-6.38","spread":"9.023"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-5.35","spread":"4.902"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-6.57","spread":"5.983"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"VC Period: Mean Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Score at Weeks 2, 4, and 8","description":"The PGIC is a participants' self-reporting measure that reflects their belief about the efficacy of treatment.
