The primary hypotheses are that the addition of metformin 250 mg b.i.d. or metformin 500 mg q.d. is superior to the addition of placebo on the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 24 weeks and that the addition of metformin 500 mg q.d. is non-inferior to the addition of metformin 250 mg b.i.d. on the change from baseline in HbA1c at 24 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Metformin 500 mg q.d.","deltaMin":-0.434,"sd":null},{"arm":"Metformin 250 mg b.i.d.","deltaMin":-0.587,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.091,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":138},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Constipation","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
