Only those patients with active functioning syndrome at entry can continue with SS analogues during the study.\n* Adequate bone marrow and renal functions, and serum fasting cholesterol\n* Women with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test.\n* Written Informed Consent obtained according to local regulations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous treatment with chemotherapy and/or mTOR inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n* Immune therapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the patient entering the study.\n* Hepatic artery embolization within the last 6 months (1 month if there are other sites of measurable disease), or cryoablation/radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastasis within 2 months of enrolment.\n* Previous treatment with Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) within the last 6 months and/or without progression following PRRT.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n* Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions.\n* Treatment with potent inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A) isoenzyme within 5 days immediately before the start of treatment.\n* Patients on chronic treatment with corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive agent.\n* Patients known to be HIV seropositive.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or its excipients or other rapamycin analogues. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to 5FU or STZ or its excipients (notice that this criterion includes patients with known deficit of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency -DPD).\n* Pregnant, lactating women or fertile adults not using effective birth control methods.\n* For administrative matters (insurance) patients â‰¥ 95 are not allowed during the trial.\n\nOnly those patients coming from the hospital pool will be included in SEQTOR trial (e.g. persons detained in an institution as a result of an official or court order are excluded).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
