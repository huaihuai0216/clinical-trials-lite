In this 3-weeks, double-blind, parallel design trial, eligible participants will be randomized to receive one out of three fixed dose levels of asenapine, or placebo. The study primary hypothesis is that at least one asenapine dose is superior to placebo as measured by the change from baseline to Day 21 in Young Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Trial medication and placebo are provided as identical-looking sublingual tablets; concurrent use of psychotropics is prohibited, except use of short-acting benzodiazepines and psychostimulants approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Main treatment effect is measured using Y-MRS and safety is evaluated using the recordings of adverse events, routine blood panels, physical examinations (including vital signs), and electrocardiograms. Participants who complete the double blind trial may be offered to continue (open-label) treatment with asenapine for an extended period of time. Follow-up information on safety parameters will be collected in all participants within 30 days following treatment discontinuation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Y-MRS Total Score at Day 21","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 21","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-9.6,"sd":7.8},{"arm":"Asenapine 2.5 mg BID","deltaMin":-12.3,"sd":9},{"arm":"Asenapine 5.0 mg BID","deltaMin":-15.1,"sd":9.5},{"arm":"Asenapine 10.0 mg BID","deltaMin":-15.9,"sd":9.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.008"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0021"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26598478"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":101},"commonTop":["SOMNOLENCE","HYPOAESTHESIA ORAL","SEDATION","HEADACHE","PARAESTHESIA ORAL"]}}
