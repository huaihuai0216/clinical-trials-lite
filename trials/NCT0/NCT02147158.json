The first 8 questions comprise the Symptom Severity subscale to assess symptoms experienced by women with uterine leiomyomas, the remaining 29 questions comprise 6 subscales (Concern, Activities, Energy/mood, Control, Self-consciousness, Sexual Function) which overall deal with women's feelings and experiences regarding impact of uterine leiomyoma symptoms on her life. Each item is scored between 1 and 5, where 1=none of the time or not at all and 5=all of the time or a very great deal. A Revised Activities subscale was created to include the most relevant items pertaining to physical and social activities with a total possible score of 0 to 100. Higher Revised Activities subscale scores indicate less impact on activities. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"28.70","spread":"24.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.52","spread":"24.05"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"33.24","spread":"27.00"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.25","spread":"28.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"50.19","spread":"32.07"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"54.73","spread":"32.32"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":116},"commonTop":["Hot flush","Headache","Nausea","Fatigue","Nasopharyngitis"]}}}
