This included written documentation of having met electroencephalogram (EEG) diagnostic criteria during the participant's history and evidence of at least 1 type of generalized seizure, including drop seizures (atonic, tonic, tonic-clonic or myoclonic) for at least 6 months.\n* Participant had a history of slow (\\<3.0 hertz \\[Hz\\]) spike-and-wave pattern in an EEG prior to the enrollment into the baseline period.\n* Participant had at least 2 drop seizures each week during the first 28 days of the baseline period.\n* Participant was refractory; that is having documented failures on more than 1 antiepileptic drug (AED).\n* Participant was taking 1 or more AEDs at a dose which had been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation \\[VNS\\]) were stable for 4 weeks prior to screening and the participant was willing to maintain a stable regimen throughout the study. The ketogenic diet and VNS treatments were not counted as an AED.\n* Participant and/or parent(s)/legal representatives were willing to allow his or her primary care practitioner and consultant to be notified of participation in the study.\n* Participant completed his or her interactive voice response (IVRS) telephone diary on at least 25 days of the baseline period.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Etiology of participant's seizures was a progressive neurologic disease. Participants with tuberous sclerosis were not excluded from study participation, unless there was a progressive tumor.\n* Participant had an anoxic episode requiring resuscitation within 6 months of screening.\n* Participant had clinically significant unstable medical conditions other than epilepsy.\n* Participant had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically significant illness in the 4 weeks prior to screening or randomization, other than epilepsy.\n* Participant had a history or presence of alcohol or substance abuse within the last 2 years prior to the study or daily consumption of 5 or more alcohol-containing beverages.\n* Participant was currently using or had in the past used recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-based medications (including Sativex®) within the 3 months prior to study entry and was unwilling to abstain for the duration of the study.\n* Participant had a history of symptoms (for example, dizziness, light-headedness, blurred vision, palpitations, weakness, syncope) related to a drop in blood pressure due to postural changes.\n* Participant had any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the IMP, such as sesame oil.\n* Female participant was of child bearing potential or male participant's partner was of child bearing potential; unless willing to ensure that they or their partner used a highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study and for 3 months thereafter.\n* Female participant was pregnant (positive pregnancy test), lactating or planning pregnancy during the course of the study and for 3 months thereafter.\n* Participant had been part of a clinical study involving another IMP in the previous 6 months.\n* Patient had significantly impaired hepatic function at screening (Day -28) or randomization (Day 1), defined as any of the following: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\> 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); ALT or AST \\> 3 × ULN and total bilirubin \\> 2 × ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) \\> 1.5; ALT or AST \\> 3 × ULN with the presence of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (\\>5%). This criterion could only be confirmed once the laboratory results were available; participants randomized into the study who were later found not to meet this criterion were withdrawn from the study.\n* Any history of suicidal behavior or any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale in the last month or at screening.\n* Participant was unwilling to abstain from donation of blood during the study.\n* Participant planned to travel outside his or her country of residence during the study.\n* Participant had previously randomized into the study.\n* Participant was taking more than 4 concurrent AEDs.\n* Participant had taken corticotropins in the 6 months prior to screening.\n* Participant was currently taking long-term systemic steroids (excluding inhaled medication for asthma treatment) or any other daily medication known to exacerbate epilepsy. An exception was made of prophylactic medication, for example, idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or asthma.\n* Participant was taking felbamate, and he or she had been taking it for less than 1 year prior to screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"2 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage Change From Baseline In Drop Seizure Frequency During The Treatment Period","description":"Drop seizures were recorded by the participant or caregiver using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) diary.

On Day 1 (prior to starting IMP), the caregiver was asked to write a brief description of the participant's overall condition as a memory aid for the S/CGIC questionnaire at subsequent visits. If both a CGIC and SGIC were completed then the CGIC was used; if only a CGIC was completed then the CGIC was used; if only a SGIC was completed then the SGIC was used.
