The safety of dosing based on blood levels will also be studied.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment-related Mortality (TRM)","timeFrame":"From transplant at Day 0 to Day 100 and 1 year following transplant","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fixed-Dose: Participants in CR","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adjusted Dose: Participants in CR","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fixed Dose: Participants Not in CR","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adjusted Dose: Participants Not in CR","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.9"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.4"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.7"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":114},"commonTop":["Infection","Skin GvHD","Liver GvHD","Chronic Ocular GvHD","Chronic Skin GvHD"]}}
