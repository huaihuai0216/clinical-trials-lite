Planned administration/administration of routine vaccines up to 8 days before the first dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window.\n* Previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine\n* Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen by the study protocol during the study period.\n* History of HPV infection/treatment or planned treatment to evaluate an abnormal cervical cytology (Pap smear) test, e.g. colposcopy.\n* Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of allergic disease, suspected allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* Known acute or chronic, clinically significant neurologic, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by previous physical examination or laboratory tests.\n* History of chronic condition(s) requiring treatment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood product within three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned administration during the study period. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Heavy bleeding (menstruation or other) or heavy vaginal discharge in which a pelvic exam cannot be performed (and no cervical sample can be taken).
