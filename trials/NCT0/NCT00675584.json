Participants may be reassessed if not initially eligible.\n\n* Positive asthma predictive index (API) status\n* A history of at least 4 wheezing episodes in the prior year with at least one physician diagnosed or at least 3 wheezing episodes in the prior year with at least one physician diagnosed and at least 3 months of asthma controller therapy in the prior year\n* Experienced a severe exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, urgent unscheduled or emergency visit, or hospitalization in the 12 months before the screening visit\n* All immunizations must be completed, including varicella (unless the child has already had clinical varicella). If the child needs the varicella vaccine, this will be arranged with the primary care physician and must be received before study entry.\n* Allows blood to be used for genetic analysis\n* Willingness to provide informed consent by the child's parent or guardian\n\nExclusion Criteria at Screening Visit:\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria are NOT eligible for enrollment, but they may be re-enrolled if these exclusion criteria disappear:\n\n* Use of more than six courses of systemic corticosteroids in the 12 months before the screening visit\n* More than two hospitalizations for wheezing illnesses in the 12 months before the screening visit\n* Use of oral or systemic corticosteroids in the 2 weeks before the screening visit\n* Current treatment with antibiotics for diagnosed sinus disease\n* Current participation or has participated in the month before the screening visit in another investigational drug trial\n* Evidence that the family may be unreliable or nonadherent, or may move from the clinical center area before trial completion\n* Medically unable to use systemic corticosteroids\n* Clinically relevant gastroesophageal reflux\n* Inability of the child to cooperate with nebulizer therapy\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria are NOT eligible for enrollment, and they may not be re-enrolled:\n\n* Gestation less than late preterm, as defined as birth before 34 weeks gestational age\n* Significant developmental delay/failure to thrive, defined as crossing of two major percentile lines during the last year for age and gender. If a child plots less than the 10th percentile for age and gender, a growth chart for the previous year will be obtained from the child's primary care provider.\n* Head circumference less than the 3rd percentile or greater than the 97th percentile unless medical evaluation documents no associated illness\n* Presence of lung disease other than asthma, such as cystic fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Evaluation during the screening process will assure that an adequate evaluation of other lung diseases has been performed.\n* Presence of other significant medical illnesses (e.g., cardiac, liver, gastrointestinal, endocrine) that would place the child at increased risk of participating in the study\n* Immunodeficiency disorders\n* History of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation\n* History of hypoxic seizure\n* History of significant adverse reaction to any study medication ingredient\n\nExclusion Criteria at Baseline Visit:\n\nParticipants will be ineligible to continue in the study and be randomly assigned to a treatment group if any of the following is documented during the 2-week observation period, but they may be re-enrolled if these exclusion criteria disappear:\n\n* Persistent symptomatic asthma, as defined as experiencing symptoms requiring albuterol use on average three or more days per week or two or more night time awakenings due to asthma-associated symptoms\n* Inadequate adherence (less than 75% of days) to diary card completion or nebulizer medication use\n* Use of any asthma medication except albuterol (used on as needed basis)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"53
