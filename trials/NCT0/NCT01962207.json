Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster vaccination or planned administration during the follow-up period.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product .\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines.\n* History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). History of a simple, single febrile seizure is permitted.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary, tympanic, or ≥38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.\n* Male subjects able to father
