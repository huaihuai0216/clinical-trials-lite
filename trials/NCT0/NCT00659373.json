Performance speed is measured for Detection/Identification/Monitoring and performance accuracy is measured for Memory/Learning/ISLT/ISLT-Delayed Recall. Performance speed calculated as mean of the log10 transformed reaction time for correct responses (lower score=better); performance accuracy calculated as arcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses (higher scores=better). Main outcome measure is a composite score (average of task scores after transformation and standardization by age-specific norms). A positive standardized score indicates that a patient performed better than average; a negative standardized score indicates below average results. Patients complete assessments at baseline and 1 year after randomization to parent IBCSG 24-02 (SOFT) study.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-.04","spread":"0.49"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.21","spread":"0.92"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}}
