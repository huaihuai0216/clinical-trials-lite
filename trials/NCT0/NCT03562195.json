Current asthma treatment guidelines offer minimal options for the severe asthmatic subjects on intensive therapy with frequent exacerbations. There is a significant unmet medical need to provide better treatment options for this segment of the asthma population. Thus, this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab in Chinese severe asthmatic subjects with eosinophilic inflammation. A total number of 300 subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either mepolizumab or placebo along with existing standard of care therapy. The maximum study duration will be 56 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Clinically Significant Exacerbations of Asthma","timeFrame":"Up to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mepolizumab 100mg","deltaMin":0.45,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.31,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":42,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38770009","40736776"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":149},"commonTop":["Asthma","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Bronchitis","Rhinitis allergic"]}}
