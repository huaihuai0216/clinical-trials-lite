The investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized crossover trial in subjects with RA to test the hypothesis that HCQ improves insulin sensitivity. The investigators will also use data from the trial to identify determinants of insulin resistance in RA. The investigators hypothesize that RA will be associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance and that independent risk factors for increased insulin resistance in RA include higher BMI, elevated acute phase reactants, greater fat to muscle ratio, and less physical activity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Insulin Sensitivity Index","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hydroxychloroquine","deltaMin":7.7,"sd":4.8},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.7,"sd":4.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.930"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.785"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["10480510","15289378","12087016","8566109","11396092","16908509","15843450","12628952","15751097","15529391","11368701","16947779","18576352","3069509","3888217","10072192","2110430","11850097","17622600","24470436"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Rash","Liver Function Test Abnormality"]}}
