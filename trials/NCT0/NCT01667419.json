Participants will be enrolled in two separate cohorts: Cohort 1 will include participants with completely resected Stage IIC, IIIA (participants with one or more nodal metastasis greater than \\[\\>\\] 1 millimeter \\[mm\\] in diameter), or IIIB cutaneous melanoma, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Classification, Version 7; Cohort 2 will include participants with Stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma, as defined by this classification scheme. Within each cohort, participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive vemurafenib or matching placebo over a 52-week period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease-Free Survival (DFS) as Assessed Using Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CT)","timeFrame":"From randomization until the date of the first local, regional, or distant melanoma recurrence, occurrence of new primary melanoma, or death from any cause (up to the April 17, 2017 data cut-off, approximately 4.5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort 1 Vemurafenib","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 1 Placebo","deltaMin":36.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2 Vemurafenib","deltaMin":23.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2 Placebo","deltaMin":15.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0010"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.2598"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":207,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31912791","29477665"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":154},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Fatigue","Nausea","Rash","Alopecia"]}}
