Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance in millimeters (mm) on the line between the \"no pain\" anchor and the participant's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. The recommended cut points for VAS are: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm). The change in VAS-pain score is the score from the each follow-up visit subtracted from the baseline score.
