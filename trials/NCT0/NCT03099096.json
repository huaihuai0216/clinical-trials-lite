This Phase III study will be an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug product in autoinjector (100 milligrams \\[mg\\]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (3 doses) in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg mepolizumab SC as a single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or administered in the upper arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 weeks including pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment period which concludes with end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab. Approximately 158 subjects will be enrolled in the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Observed Third Dose at Week 8 - Autoinjector With Standard Label + Pictogram","timeFrame":"Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mepolizumab Liquid Autoinjector","deltaMin":99,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Germany","Russia","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31251090"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":159},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Lower respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection"]}}
