Currently, there are many available treatments for managing COPD symptoms and improving quality of life, including medications, lifestyle changes, oxygen therapy, and pulmonary rehabilitation. For people with severe COPD that is characterized by very low blood oxygen levels at rest, long term oxygen therapy can help to prolong life and promote feelings of well-being. However, the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen therapy for people with COPD that is characterized by only moderately low blood oxygen levels at rest or normal blood oxygen at rest and desaturation on exercise is not known. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen therapy in treating people with COPD who have moderately low blood oxygen levels at rest or who have normal blood oxygen levels at rest, but have low or very low blood oxygen levels during exercise.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Death or Hospitalization, Whichever Occurs First","timeFrame":"Through study completion.
