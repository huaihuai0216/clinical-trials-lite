The subjects randomized in the first portion of the study will have active fungal infection of the ear(s) and will be treated with either Miconazole Oil or the Vehicle for 14 days twice daily, 5 drops into the affected ear(s) per dose. The subjects enrolled in the open-label portion of the study may or may not have active fungal infection of the ear(s), and will be given the Miconazole Oil active drug following the same application of 5 drops into the ear(s) twice daily for 14 days.\n\nThe intention of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Miconazole Oil on fungal infection of the ears when applied using 5 drops into the ear(s) twice daily for 14 days continuously. This study also intends to show safety of Miconazole Oil 5 drops into each ear twice a day for 14 consecutive days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Therapeutic Cure","timeFrame":"21 days from first day of drug application","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Treatment Arm","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Treatment Arm","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":89},"commonTop":["ear infection fungal","application site pruritus","ear discomfort","application site pain","otitis externa"]}}
