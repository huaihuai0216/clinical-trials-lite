The participant is secured in the chair in total darkness while the eyes are monitored by infrared cameras. We completed tests from 0.04 to 0.64 Hz to assess the vestibular system across a range of head movements. The chair and participant's head move together while the cameras track the velocity of the eyes; eye velocity reveals how the vestibular system responds to head velocity. VOR gain is the ratio of average chair (i.e. head) velocity to average eye velocity, and is represented on a unitless scale from 0 to 1. VOR gain close to 1 indicates that eye velocity is nearly equal and opposite to head velocity. While there are normative ranges for VOR gain, we are most interested in is change in mean gain (6-week tests minus baseline tests) for the active and placebo groups.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.0107","spread":"0.0868"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.0229","spread":"0.0521"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.0061","spread":"0.0759"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.283","spread":"0.0340"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.0151","spread":"0.0949"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0871","spread":"0.0702"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.0422","spread":"0.1154"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0322","spread":"0.0680"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0221","spread":"0.0894"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0151","spread":"0.0614"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR) Asymmetry (Percentage Asymmetric) at 6 Weeks","description":"Mean changes in VOR asymmetry, which is a measure of the strength of the eye responses in one direction compared with the other as measured by rotary chair testing at 6 weeks, will be compared for active and placebo treated subjects using t-tests, or other appropriate statistical analyses. A range of frequencies was tested from 0.04 Hz to 0.64 Hz, as is standard for rotary chair testing.
