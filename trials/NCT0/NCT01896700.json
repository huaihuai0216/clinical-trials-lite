It is also often prescribed off label to people with MS to improve fatigue. It is proposed that methylphenidate may also improve imbalance and walking deficits in MS by improving concentration and central integration, one of the primary mechanisms thought to underlie imbalance and walking deficits in MS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test Time at 6 Weeks","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methylphenidate","deltaMin":-0.7,"sd":0.5},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.3,"sd":0.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Constipation","Coughing/sneezing/respiratory effects","Elevated blood pressure","Headache"]}}
