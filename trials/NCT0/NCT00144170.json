Human immunodeficiency virus-1 viral load \\>=1000 copies/mL at screening.\n6. Acceptable screening laboratory values that indicate adequate baseline organ function. Laboratory values are considered to be acceptable if the following apply:\n\n   * Total cholesterol \\<=400 mg/dl or 10,36 mm/L.\n   * Total triglycerides \\<=750 mg/dl or 8,5 mm/L.\n   * Alanine aminotransferase \\<=3x upper limit of normal and aspartate aminotransferase \\<=2.5x upper limit of normal.\n   * Any Grade gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is acceptable.\n   * Any Grade creatinine kinase is acceptable as long as there is no concurrent myopathy.\n   * All other laboratory test values \\<= Grade 1(Division of Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, National Institute of Health grading scale).\n7. Acceptable medical history, as assessed by the investigator, with chest X-ray and electrocardiogram within 1 year of study participation.\n8. Willingness to abstain from ingesting substances during the study which may alter plasma study drug levels by interaction with the cytochrome P450 system.\n9. A prior Acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining event is acceptable as long as it has resolved or the patient has been on stable treatment for at least 2 months (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome related complex is acceptable).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Antiretroviral medication naïve.\n2. Patients on recent drug holiday, defined as off antiretroviral medications for at least 7 consecutive days within the last 3 months.\n3. Alanine aminotransferase \\>3x upper limit of normal and aspartate aminotransferase \\>2.5x upper limit of normal at either screening visit.\n4. Female patients of child-bearing potential who:\n\n   * have a positive serum pregnancy test at screening or during the study,\n   * are breast feeding\n   * are planning to become pregnant, or\n   * are not willing to use a barrier method of contraception, or\n   * require ethinyl estradiol administration\n5. Prior tipranavir use.\n6. Use of investigational medications within 30 days before study entry or during the trial. (T-20 \\[enfuvirtide\\] and Tenofovir (Viread), investigational at the time of writing of this protocol, will be allowed.)\n7. Use of immunomodulatory drugs within 30 days before study entry or during the trial (e.g. interferon, cyclosporin, hydroxyurea, interleukin 2).\n8. Inability to adhere to the requirements of the protocol, including active substance abuse as assessed by the investigator.\n9. In the opinion of the investigator, likely survival of less than 12 months because of underlying disease.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Treatment Response at Week 48","description":"Patients who experienced treatment response.
