Despite the commonality of migraine recurrence within the week following discharge, no known effective therapies are available in the pediatric population, though dexamethasone has been established as efficacious in the adult migraine population. The proposed study will randomly assign children and adolescents visiting the emergency department (ED) for migraine to receive either one dose of oral dexamethasone or oral placebo. Twenty patients will be recruited to this randomized, double-blind, pilot trial over a 6 month period, and the aim of the study will be to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the protocol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Headache Recurrence at 48 Hours","timeFrame":"48 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dexamethasone","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22384463","23771276"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":["Worsening headache","Paresthesias","Constipation","Fever"]}}
