Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol up to Visit 4 after vaccination and of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccines up to Visit 4.\n* Vaccination against influenza since February 2008 with a seasonal influenza vaccine.\n* Previous vaccination in the last three years with an investigational adjuvanted vaccine candidate seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of hypersensivity to a previous dose of influenza vaccine.\n* History of allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s) including egg or chicken protein.\n* Acute (active) clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by clinical evaluation or pre-existing laboratory screening tests.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first administration of the study vaccine or planned administration during the study.\n* Any medical conditions in which intramuscular injections are contraindicated.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female of childbearing age planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.\n* Any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator precludes the collection of blood volumes as required by the protocol.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Geometric Mean (GM) Number of Influenza-specific CD4 T-cells Per Million CD4+ T-cells Identified After in Vitro Stimulation With Pooled Vaccine Strains Which Are Producing at Least Two Different Markers","description":"The markers assessed were Cluster of Differentiation 40 Ligand (CD40L), interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3371.11","spread":"3602.15"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2108.10","spread":"1728.38"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"The GM Number of Influenza-specific CD4 T-cells Per Million CD4+ T-cells Identified After in Vitro Stimulation With Pooled Vaccine Strains and With Each Vaccine Strain Separately Which Were Producing at Least Two Different Markers","description":"The markers assessed were CD40L, IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ.
