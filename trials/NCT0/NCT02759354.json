Informed consent signed by the participant's parent(s) or legal representative.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participant who has received any dose of hepatitis B (HB)-containing vaccine at any time other than study vaccine in V419-007 or V419-008 study.\n2. Participant with a history of diagnosis (clinical, serological or microbiological) of HB virus infection of the V419-007 or V419-008 study.\n3.
