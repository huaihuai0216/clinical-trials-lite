We used the 17-item version of the 27-item HRSD, a measure of depression severity. The Structured Interview Guide was used to conduct the interviews (SIGH-D; Williams, 1988). The reliability and validity of the HRSD are well documented (Rabkin \\& Klein, 1987). Interjudge reliability as assessed by interclass correlations was .92 in our sample. Total 17-item scores could range from 17-48 with higher scores indicating greater distress.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.0","spread":"3.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19.9","spread":"3.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"19.4","spread":"3.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.9","spread":"7.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.5","spread":"6.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12.7","spread":"6.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.2","spread":"7.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.5","spread":"8.3"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"14.3","spread":"7.6"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":55},"commonTop":["passive suicide attempt"]}}}
