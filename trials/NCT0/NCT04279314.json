Has developed a clinically significant cardiovascular, endocrine (such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, or uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes mellitus), renal, hepatic, respiratory, or gastrointestinal disease (such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease) or has major surgery planned during the study\n5. Subject is judged by the Investigator or the Medical Monitor to be inappropriate for the study due to AEs, medical condition, or noncompliance with investigational product or study procedures in the antecedent study\n6.

Has developed a clinically significant ECG finding during the antecedent study\n\nAdditional inclusion/exclusion criteria apply. Patients will be evaluated at baseline to ensure that all criteria for study participation are met. Patients may be excluded from the study based on these assessments (and specifically, if it is determined that their baseline health and condition do not meet all prespecified entry criteria).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"5 Years","maximumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Percentage of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Percentage of Subjects With Withdrawals Due to AEs","description":"Percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), percentage of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs), and percentage of subjects with withdrawals due to AEs","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"132","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Subjects (N, %) With Post-baseline Potentially Clinically Important Changes in ECG","description":"Potentially clinically important ECG changes were defined in the study protocol as absolute QTcF interval \\>500 ms or QTcF interval change from the baseline value of previous study ACP-2566-003 of \\>60 ms","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Subjects (N, %) With Post-baseline Potentially Clinically Important Changes in Vital Signs","description":"Potentially clinically important changes in vital signs were defined in the study protocol as:\n\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥180 mmHg and increased ≥20 mmHg from baseline;
