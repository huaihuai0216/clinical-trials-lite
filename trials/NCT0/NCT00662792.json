All patients must sign an informed consent consistent with ICH-GCP guidelines and local legislations prior to any study-related procedures, which includes medication washout and restrictions.\n2. All patients must have a diagnosis of COPD and must meet the following criteria:\n\n   relatively stable\\* airway obstruction with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 \\< 80% of predicted normal and post-bronchodilator FEV1 \\< 70% of post-bronchodilator FVC at Visit 1 (according to GOLD criteria).\n\n   \\* The randomisation of patients with any respiratory infection or COPD exacerbation in the 6 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the baseline period should be postponed. Patients may be randomised 6 weeks following recovery from the infection or exacerbation. Predicted normal values will be calculated according to ECSC.\n3. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.\n4. Patients must be current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of 10 pack-years.\n5. Patients must be able to perform technically acceptable pulmonary function tests\n6. Patients must be able to inhale medication in a competent manner.\n7. Patients must be able to perform all necessary recordings in the diary.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Significant diseases other than COPD\n2. Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline haematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion criterion No. 1.\n3. Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction.\n4. Patients with any unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention or change in drug therapy during the past year.\n5. Hospitalisation for cardiac failure during the past year.\n6. Malignancy within the last five years excluded basal cell carcinoma.\n7.

Known hypersensitivity to used drugs or other components of the study medication.\n17. Pregnant or nursing women\n18. Women of childbearing potential not using a highly effective method of birth control. Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner. Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or post-menopausal for at least two years.\n19.
