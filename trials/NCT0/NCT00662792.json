The main secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of the Tiotropium plus Salmeterol Inhalation Powder versus the comparator treatments.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Response in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Area Under the Curve From 0 - 12 Hours (AUC0-12)","timeFrame":"At baseline and 10 minutes (min) prior to inhalation and 30 min, 60 min, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after inhalation of the morning dose after 6 weeks of treatment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"7.5 µg /25 µg Tio /Salmeterol (T+S_PE)","deltaMin":0.187,"sd":0.026},{"arm":"18 µg Tiotropium (Tio18GEL)","deltaMin":0.117,"sd":0.026},{"arm":"50 µg Salmeterol MDPI (Salm50DPI)","deltaMin":0.057,"sd":0.026},{"arm":"18 µg Tiotropium Free Combination (T18GEL+S_DPI)","deltaMin":0.211,"sd":0.026}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.0914"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mystudywindow.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":132},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Dyspnoea"]}}
