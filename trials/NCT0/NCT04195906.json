In case of missing assessments for any one of the 17 items, the median of the scores for a particular item within the associated randomized treatment group was used for the imputation purposes.\n\nAs the absolute change from baseline is reported, a higher negative value is associated with a higher improvement of quality of life.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.67","spread":"0.798"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.74","spread":"1.175"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Absolute Change in the BWAT Total Score for the Primary Lesion","description":"The Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (BWAT) score ranges from a minimum score of 9 (best) to a maximum score of 65 (worst) score.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11.0","spread":"9.85"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-11.7","spread":"12.23"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Qualitative Wound Image Evaluation for the Primary Lesion","description":"A qualitative assessment (Worsened, Equal to, or Improved Relative to Baseline) was assigned","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Rate of Change in Opioid Use as Measured in Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME)","description":"Change from baseline in opioid use MME = Morphine Milligram Equivalents\n\nThe calculation of the pre-specified list of opioids was based on the formula: strength per unit × (number of units/days supply) × MME conversion factor = MME/day, as specified in the opioid MME conversion guide (CMS, 2017).
