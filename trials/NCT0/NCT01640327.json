The principal aim was to provide safety and immunogenicity data, in compliance to current EU Guidelines, with the intent of obtaining marketing approval of the vaccine formulation intended for use prior to the next influenza season in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe antibody response to each influenza vaccine antigen, was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and single radial hemolysis (SRH) at approximately 21 days postimmunization in adult and elderly subjects. The safety and immunogenicity of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of the vaccine was evaluated in compliance with the requirements of the current EU recommendations for clinical trials related to yearly licensing of influenza vaccines (CPMP/BWP/214/96).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects With Seroconversion or Significant Increase in HI Titer Against Each of Three Vaccine Strains After One Vaccination of TIVf","timeFrame":"Day 22","effectByArm":[{"arm":"18-60 Y","deltaMin":83,"sd":null},{"arm":"≥61 Y","deltaMin":60,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":63},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Myalgia","Fatigue","Headache","Hyperhidrosis"]}}
