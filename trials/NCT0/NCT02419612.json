We will compare the change from baseline in HbA1c achieved with saxagliptin, in co-administration with dapagliflozin, added to current background therapy with metformin compared to glimepiride added to current background therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg at Week 52.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 52","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dapagliflozin 10mg and Saxagliptin 5mg","deltaMin":-1.35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Titrated Glimepiride","deltaMin":-0.98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":84,"countries":["United States","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Russia","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32052516"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=4128&filename=CV181365_CSP.PDF"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":227},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Bronchitis"]}}
