Have a concurrent disease or condition that may interfere with study participation, or any serious medical disorder that would interfere with the subject's safety (for example, active or uncontrolled infection or any psychiatric condition prohibiting understanding or rendering of informed consent)\n7. Have any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels\n8. Have a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to any of the study agents or their excipients that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK medical monitor, contraindicates their participation\n9. Any prohibited medication.\n10. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of study treatment.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) Events in Lapatinib + Trastuzumab + Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) vs. Trastuzumab + Aromatase Inhibitor (AI)","description":"The Number of Participants with Progression free survival (PFS) events in the Lapatinib + Trastuzumab + Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) arm vs. Trastuzumab + Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) arm was based on assessments by the Investigator.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"62","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"75","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"51","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"39","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Median Kaplan Meier Estimates for PFS in Lapatinib + Trastuzumab + Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) vs. Trastuzumab + Aromatase Inhibitor (AI)","description":"Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the interval of time between the date of randomization and the earliest date of disease progression (with radiological evidence) or death from any cause, or to the date of censor.
