The SOPS is comprised of symptoms that are classified as falling into four pathology domains: positive, negative, disorganized and general. The scales identify and measure five attenuated positive psychotic symptoms, six negative symptoms, four disorganization symptoms and four general symptoms. These seven-point scales cover severity variance in the subpsychotic or attenuated range. Each item is scaled 0-6, with 0-2 being the normal range, 3-5 being the risk syndrome range, and 6 being severe and psychotic for the positive symptoms and very severe for the other symptoms. The higher the score, the more symptoms an individual has and is therefore negative in its interpretation. The severity of the prodromal state is judged according to the sum of the ratings from each of the SOPS items and can range from 0 to 114. Actual SOPS total scores in this study ranged from 23 to 59 across subjects at baseline.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37.8","spread":"15.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.5","spread":"10.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Scale of Prodromal Symptoms Total Score","description":"Scale Of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS) is a 19-item instrument.
