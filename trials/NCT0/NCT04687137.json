Lanadelumab, also known as TAK-743, is a medicine to help prevent hereditary angioedema attacks. Lanadelumab is not yet licensed for use in Japan.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to allow Japanese teenagers and adults with type I or type II hereditary angioedema to be treated with lanadelumab, through the expanded access program in Japan.\n\nParticipants can either have taken part in the previous study SHP643-302 or can be new participants. Participants just completing study SHP643-302 who reach the criteria can automatically take part in this study. However, for new participants, the study doctor will check who can take part at the first study visit.\n\nFor those who can take part, new participants will receive injections of lanadelumab just under the skin. Eventually, after training, some of these will be able to inject themselves with lanadelumab in the same way. Participants who injected themselves with lanadelumab in study SHP643-302 can continue to do so during this study.\n\nThe study doctors will decide if each participant will be treated with lanadelumab every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks. Treatment with lanadelumab will continue until lanadelumab is commercially available in Japan or the sponsor (Takeda) stops the study.\n\nParticipants can visit the clinic during treatment if needed. If treatment continues after 6 months, participants will visit the clinic every 12 weeks for a check-up. This will include noting any hereditary angioedema attacks and side effects from the treatment. After 7 months of treatment, the study staff will check-up with each participant every 2 weeks by telephone.\n\nAfter treatment has finished, participants will visit the clinic for a final-check-up 4 weeks later.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Including Serious TEAEs and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)","timeFrame":"From start of study drug administration (in current study) up to end of study (EOS) (Day 294)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rollover Participants","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"Non-rollover Participants","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5ff6fe77565ce300294c6abe"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":11},"commonTop":["Hereditary angioedema","Vaccination complication","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Contusion"]}}
