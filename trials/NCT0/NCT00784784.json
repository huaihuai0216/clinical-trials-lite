For the larger trial the investigators are interested in understanding the relative benefits of vaccine and antiviral prophylaxis, the risk factors for influenza infection in healthy adults, and in assessing the safety and tolerability of seasonal antiviral prophylaxis in healthcare workers.\n\nThe pilot study will be assessing the rate of infection with influenza and the rate of adherence to long-term zanamivir in 60 healthy volunteers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Laboratory Confirmed Influenza Infections","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Influenza Vaccine","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Antiviral Prophylaxis","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.25"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
