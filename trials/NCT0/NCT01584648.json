Subjects with histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma that is either Stage IIIC (unresectable) or Stage IV, and BRAF V600E/K mutation positive were screened for eligibility. Subjects who had prior systemic anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting were not eligible although prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting was allowed. Subjects were stratified according to the baseline lactate dehydrogenase level and BRAF genotype.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator","timeFrame":"From randomization until the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause (up to approximately 6 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dabrafenib + Trametinib","deltaMin":10.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dabrafenib + Placebo","deltaMin":8.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":121,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","France","Germany","Greece","Italy","Netherlands","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34225229","33587894","31166680","27864013","26037941","25794603","25411413","25265492"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":100,"n":209},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Fatigue","Nausea","Headache","Arthralgia"]}}
