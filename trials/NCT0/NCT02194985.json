Each AE was recorded at time of reporting; visits typically occurred every 6 months. Serious AEs were life threatening or resulted in death, resulted in disability/incapacity, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, or a congenital anomaly. The criteria for AE severity were: Mild: awareness of sign or symptom, does not interfere with normal everyday activities; Moderate: discomforting, interferes with normal everyday activities, but able to function; Severe: incapacitating, prevents normal everyday activities or significantly affects clinical status and requires medical intervention. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"80","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"56","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Annualized Rate Of Change In The Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)","description":"The annualized rate of change in the eGFR was assessed per participant by the slope of the simple linear regression between the observed values and the assessment times.
