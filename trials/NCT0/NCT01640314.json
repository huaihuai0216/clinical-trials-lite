Individuals with history or any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, pose additional risk to the subjects due to participation in the study.\n9. Individuals who within the past 6 months have:\n\n   * had any laboratory confirmed seasonal or pandemic influenza disease;\n   * received any seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine.\n10. Individuals who received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to enrollment in this study or who are planning to receive any vaccine during the study.\n11. Individuals with any acute or chronic infections requiring systemic antibiotic treatment or antiviral therapy within the last 7 days.\n12.
