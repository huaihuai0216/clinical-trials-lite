The CHQ-PF50 consists of 50 items organized into 15 subscales.The 15 subscales could be combined into 2 summary scores, physical and psychosocial. The calculated scores were transformed so that each scale had a range of 0-100. A higher score indicates better health. The SF-36-HS is composed of 36 items. Responses to the 36 items were combined to create 8 scales. The 8 scales could be further combined into 2 scores: Physical component summary and mental component summary. The item and scale scores were transformed to a range of 0-100 with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general US population. A higher score indicates better health. For both instruments, a positive change indicates improvement.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.63","spread":"5.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.01","spread":"5.78"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.21","spread":"6.00"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.36","spread":"7.33"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Adverse Event Causally Related to the Administration of the Study Drug","description":"An adverse event was considered to be causally related to the administration of the study drug if it judged to be probably or possibly related to the study drug, as assessed by the investigator.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Adverse Event Temporally Related to the Study Drug","description":"An adverse event was considered to be temporally related to the study drug if it started during an infusion or within 72 hours after the end of an infusion.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38.1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":["Sinusitis","Nausea","Vomiting","Abdominal pain","Diarrhoea"]}}}
