It aims at providing evidence on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic measures of 8 mg of moxidectin compared to 200 Î¼g/kg ivermectin in adults infected with S. stercoralis. The efficacy of the treatment will be assessed by collecting three stool samples once per-treatment and once 21-28 days post-treatment. The stool samples will be analyzed by a quantitative duplicate Baermann assay.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cure Rate Against Strongyloides Stercoralis","timeFrame":"14-21 days after treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Moxidectin","deltaMin":94.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ivermectin","deltaMin":99.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Cambodia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37949090"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":166},"commonTop":["Headache","Itching","Abdominal pain","Diarrhea","Vomiting"]}}
