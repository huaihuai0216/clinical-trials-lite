epithelium (RPE), subretinal fibrosis, or organized hard-exudate plaque.\n* Ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound interpretation of study results, including retinal vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, macular hole, or choroidal neovascularization (CNV) of any cause (eg, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), ocular histoplasmosis, or pathologic myopia).\n* Concurrent disease in the study eye that would compromise visual acuity or require medical or surgical intervention during the study period.\n* Cataract surgery in the study eye within 3 months, yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser capsulotomy within the past 2 months, or any other intraocular surgery within the 90 days preceding Day 0.\n* Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye.\n* Uncontrolled glaucoma or previous filtration surgery in the study eye.\n* Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye of more than -8 diopters myopia.\n* Evidence at examination of infectious blepharitis, keratitis, scleritis, or conjunctivitis in either eye or current treatment for serious systemic infection.\n* Uncontrolled blood pressure.\n* History of cerebral vascular accident or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior to Day 0.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n* Renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant.\n* Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days prior to screening that involved treatment with any drug (excluding vitamins and minerals) or device.\n* History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use an investigational drug, might affect interpretation of the results of the study, or renders the subject at high risk from treatment complications.\n* Pregnancy or lactation.\n* History of allergy to fluorescein.\n* History of allergy to ranibizumab injection or related molecule.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
