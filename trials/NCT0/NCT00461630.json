The secondary aim is to assess the effects of extended release niacin/laropiprant 2g daily on heart attack, coronary death, stroke, and revascularisation separately and to assess the effects on mortality both overall and in various categories of causes of death, and of the effects on major cardiovascular events in people with a history of different diseases at the beginning of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Major Vascular Event","timeFrame":"During scheduled treatment period (median duration 3.9 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ER Niacin/Laropiprant","deltaMin":1696,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1758,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31805983","31447131","30821829","29449329","27407053","25014686"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7137,"n":12838},"commonTop":["Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders","Gastrointestinal disorders","Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders","Vascular disorders","Metabolism and nutrition disorders"]}}
