IDQOL questionnaires were designed for infants (below the age of 4 years) with atopic dermatitis. The IDQOL was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score in each questionnaire, the more quality of life is impaired. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.95","spread":"1.078"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-10.91","spread":"1.159"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Part B: Percentage of Topical Corticosteroid (TCS) Medication-free Days From Baseline to Week 16","description":"Percentage of TCS medication-free days was calculated as the number of days that a subject used neither TCS/TCI nor system rescue therapy divided by the study days.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.04","spread":"0.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.21","spread":"0.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Part B: Mean Weekly Dose of Low Potency TCS in Grams From Baseline to Week 16","description":"Mean weekly dose of TCS in grams/week for low potency TCS from baseline to Week 16 is reported.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.4","spread":"1.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.5","spread":"1.39"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Part B: Mean Weekly Dose of TCS in Grams for Medium or High Potency TCS From Baseline to Week 16","description":"Mean weekly dose of TCS in grams/week for medium or high potency TCS from baseline to Week 16 is reported.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.1","spread":"1.70"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.0","spread":"1.54"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Part B: Mean Number of Caregiver Missed Work Days Through Week 16","description":"Mean of number of caregiver missed work days through Week 16 is reported.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.05","spread":"8.975"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.49","spread":"5.524"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":10},"commonTop":["Dermatitis atopic","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Impetigo","Pyrexia"]}}}
