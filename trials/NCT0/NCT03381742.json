The blood was collected in an evacuated vacuum tube containing 3.2% trisodium citrate and lithium heparin. Then the samples were processed within two hours of blood draw according to standard operating procedure. The physical properties of samples were analyzed using Thromboelastography (TEG) Hemostasis Analyzer (CFMS LEPU-8800, Lepu Medical Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) and automated analytical software. TEG test used four channels to detect the effects of anti-platelet therapy via the arachidonic acid (AA) and ADP pathways. TEG test results were expressed in terms of ADP-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA, range 0% - 100%), with higher values indicating greater platelet inhibition.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"80.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"73.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"66","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Bleeding (Major or Minor Bleeding)","description":"Major bleeding was defined as type ≥ 3 and minor bleeding as types 1 and 2, in accordance to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium classification.
