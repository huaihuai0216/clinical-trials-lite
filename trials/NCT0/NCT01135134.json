The subjects 5 to 15 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis will enter a no-treatment observation period of 7 days at minimum and eligibility for inclusion in this study will be assessed. Following the observation period, eligible subjects will be randomized to MF or MF placebo for a 2-week double-blind treatment. At each clinic visit (at the start of treatment and after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment or at discontinuation), nasal symptom scores, nasal findings, and adverse events (AEs), will be evaluated. A 30-day follow-up visit will take place after the completion (or discontinuation) of the 2-week treatment period, to confirm presence or absence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and trial procedure-related AEs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score at 2 Weeks","timeFrame":"Baseline and 2 weeks (or discontinuation)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MFNS","deltaMin":-3.985,"sd":0.1633},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.9081,"sd":0.2233}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":220},"commonTop":["Epistaxis","Naspharyngitis"]}}
