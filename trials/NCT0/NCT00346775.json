Change in EARNS-Q Experience Module domain scores was calculated as scores in TP2 minus scores in TP1. If the change in EARNS-Q Experience Module domain scores is +ve, product in TP2 is preferred and vice-versa. A higher product rating for one of the sprays lead to a preference for that spray. The EARNS-Q preference module was assessed only once, at the end of TP2.

The rTNSS ranges from 0 (none) to 12 (severe). Higher score represents greater severity of symptoms. The reflective assessment of the TNSS scores the four nasal symptoms over the previous 12 hours and are assessed in the morning and evening. The participants themselves scored nasal symptoms in a diary card. The analysis was done based on the rTNSS averaged over the two weeks of the treatment period.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.3","spread":"0.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.1","spread":"0.28"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number or Participants With Preference of Nasal Sprays (Nasarel or Beconase AQ) at the End of the Last Cross-over Period Using the Preference Module of the EARNS-Q","description":"The participants with preference of nasal sprays (Nasarel or Beconase AQ) at the end of the last cross-over period was planned to be analyzed using the preference module of the EARNS-Q.
