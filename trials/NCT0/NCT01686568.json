D2 glucose will be infused to evaluate hepatic glucose production at baseline and in response to insulin. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique: The plasma insulin concentration is acutely raised and maintained by a continuous infusion of insulin. Meanwhile, the plasma glucose concentration is held constant at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion. When the steady-state is achieved, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) equals glucose uptake by all the tissues in the body and is therefore a measure of tissue insulin sensitivity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.92","spread":"1.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.39","spread":"0.76"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.16","spread":"1.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.80","spread":"0.73"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Beta Cell Function From Insulin Secretion Following Ingestion of a Mixed Meal at Baseline and 6 Month Follow up","description":"Following consumption of a mixed meal, beta cell function will be evaluated from serial measurements of C-peptide.
