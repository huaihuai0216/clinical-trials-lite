that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* A male or female between, and including, 8 and 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.\n\nAll preterm subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry:\n\n* Born after a gestation period of less than or equal to 36 weeks (≤258 days).\n* Medically stable, i.e. do not require significant medical support or ongoing management for debilitating disease and have demonstrated a clinical course of sustained recovery.\n\nAll full-term subjects must satisfy the following criteria at study entry:\n\n* Born after a gestation period between and including 37 and 42 weeks (≥259 days and ≤294 days).\n* Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since birth.\n* Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of vaccine until the last study visit, except measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccines which may be given according to local immunisation practices and except rotavirus oral vaccine which is allowed at anytime during the study after hospital discharge as per prescribing information.\n* Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, meningococcal serogroup C and or Streptococcus pneumoniae disease, with the exception of hepatitis B vaccine or BCG vaccine given in the first month of life according to the national recommendations (although BCG and hepatitis B vaccines should have been given outside a 30-day window from the first administration of study vaccines).\n* History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and or S. pneumoniae disease.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s).\n* Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.\n* History of any neurologic disorders or seizures.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins (with the exception of monoclonal antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus \\[RSV\\]) and/or any blood products within one month (30 days) preceding the first dose of study vaccines.\n* Planned administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the active phase of the study.\n\nSpecific criteria for the booster part of the study (to be checked at Visit 5, study month 14):\n\n* History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and or S. pneumoniae disease.\n* Previous vaccination, except the study vaccines and hepatitis birth dose, against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hepatitis B, H. influenzae type b, meningococcal disease and or S. pneumoniae
