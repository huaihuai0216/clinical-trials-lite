A pregnancy test is not required if the participant is post-menopausal or surgically sterile.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant has a Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS), Primary Progressive MS, or Secondary Progressive MS without superimposed relapses.\n* Participant had any prior interferon beta therapy (either beta-1b or beta-1a)\n* Participant has an ongoing MS relapse.\n* Participant received any other approved disease modifying therapy for MS (e.g. glatiramer acetate) or any cytokine or anti-cytokine therapy within the 3 months prior to Study Day 1(SD1).\n* Participant had prior use of cladribine or has previously received total lymphoid irradiation.\n* Participant received oral or systemic corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) within 30 days of SD1.\n* Participant received intravenous immunoglobulins or underwent plasmapheresis within the 6 months prior to SD1.\n* Participant received immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy (including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin, methotrexate, azathioprine, linomide, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, natalizumab, laquinimod, Campath) within the 12 months prior to SD1.\n* Participant requires chronic or monthly pulse corticosteroids during the study.\n* Participant received any investigational drug or experimental procedure within 12 weeks of SD1.\n* Participant has inadequate liver function, defined by a total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase \\> 2.5 times the upper limit of the normal values.\n* Participant has inadequate bone marrow reserve, defined as a white blood cell count less than 0.5 x lower limit of normal.\n* Participant suffers from current autoimmune disease.\n* Participant suffers from major medical or psychiatric illness that in the opinion of the investigator creates undue risk to the subject or could affect compliance with the study protocol.\n* Participant has a known allergy to IFN or the excipients.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Were Neutralising Antibody (NAb) Positive at the Week 96 Visit.","description":"The NAb positive value was defined as NAb value greater or equal to 20 NU/mL.
