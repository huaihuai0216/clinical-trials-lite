Analysis was conducted in a subset of participants who signed consent to participate in the PET substudy. Amyloid PET burden was measured in a composite region of interest (ROI) by using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) mapped to the centiloid scale. The composite region was composed of the following six bilateral regions: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex. The reference region used to normalize the composite region was the cerebellar cortex. SUVR is ratio of tracer uptake in each of cingulate, frontal, parietal and temporal cortexes relative to cerebellum. The centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scans.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-81.01","spread":"47.08"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-84.93","spread":"28.38"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Mean Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Activity Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog13) Scores at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Mean Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Scores at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percentage Change From Baseline in Total Tau (T-tau) in CSF at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percentage Change From Baseline in Abeta 1-42 Levels in CSF at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percentage Change From Baseline in Phosphorylated Tau [P-tau] in CSF at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percent Change From Baseline in Hippocampal Volume at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percent Change From Baseline in Whole Brain Volume at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percent Change From Baseline in Cortical Thickness at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Ventricular Volume as Measured by MRI at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Global Score (CDR-GS) at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in CDR Sum of Boxes (SB) at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in NPI Domain Score at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total Score at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Dementia (QoL-AD) Global Score at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Symptom Guide Facilitated (GAS) at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Dependence Scale (DS) at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Resource Utilization Dementia-Lite (RUD - Lite) Scale at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Zarit Caregiver Interview for Alzheimer's Disease (ZCI-AD) at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Time to Clinical Decline","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Change From Baseline in Clinical Composite Score (Prespecified Items From The ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and CDR) at Week 104","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Part 1: Percentage of Participants With ADAS-Cog Response","description":null,"paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":195},"commonTop":["Injection site reaction","ARIA-E","ARIA-H","Fall","Headache"]}}}
