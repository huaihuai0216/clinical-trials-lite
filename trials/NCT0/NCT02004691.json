(For the US, the effect of olipudase alfa on the SRS is part of the primary objective).\n* To characterize the effect of olipudase alfa after 52 weeks of study drug administration on the following outcome measures assessed sequentially:\n\n  * The effect of olipudase alfa on liver volume;\n  * The effect of olipudase alfa on platelet count;\n  * The effect of olipudase alfa on fatigue;\n  * The effect of olipudase alfa on pain;\n  * The effect of olipudase alfa on dyspnea.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Predicted (% Predicted) Hemoglobin (Hb) and Altitude-Adjusted Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLco) at Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 1)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":48.45,"sd":10.76},{"arm":"Olipudase Alfa","deltaMin":49.44,"sd":10.99}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Chile","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Portugal","Spain","Tunisia","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38042851"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":18},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Covid-19","Arthralgia"]}}
