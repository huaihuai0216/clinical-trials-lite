Though research suggests smoking is linked with PTSD symptoms, existing smoking cessation treatments targeting PTSD smokers do not include PTSD treatment. The purpose of this study is to examine a treatment that combines evidence based treatment for PTSD (cognitive processing therapy, or CPT) with smoking cessation treatment for PTSD and a mobile text messaging program. The study objectives are to evaluate feasibility of the treatment and to examine effectiveness of CPT and smoking cessation treatment combined compared to smoking cessation treatment without CPT. Fifty Veteran smokers with PTSD will participate in fourteen study sessions, ending with the final follow-up session six months after the scheduled quit date.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Self-report 7-day Point Prevalence Smoking Abstinence at 6-month Follow-up.","timeFrame":"6-month follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CPT+ICSC","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Present-focused ICSC","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30664539"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Nausea","Increased anxiety","Congestion","Stomach pain/flank pain","Cervicalgia"]}}
