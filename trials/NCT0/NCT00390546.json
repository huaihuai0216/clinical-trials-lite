Presentation with SVT due to AVRT or AVNRT.\n2. Age 4 months or less at presentation.\n3. No major structural heart disease (patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus are allowable.\n4. No other significant co-morbid condition likely to result in non-compliance or death in next 6 months.\n\nThe SVT mechanism will be presumed to be AVRT or AVNRT if the ECG shows:\n\n* Normal complex tachycardia with abrupt onset and offset;\n* The RR interval remains relatively constant during tachycardia with heart rates of 220-310 bpm;\n* VA (ventriculo-atrial) association \\[i.e., there is a 1:1 AV relationship (except for cases of proven AV nodal reentry with a 2:1 relationship between atrium and ventricle)\\]; and\n* Termination of tachycardia with vagal maneuvres or adenosine with AV block or VA block.\n\nAdditional supportive information:\n\n* The presence of a P wave in either the ST segment or T wave, or the presence of a P wave altering the terminal portion of the QRS complex;\n* Spontaneous termination of the tachycardia with a P wave;\n* Onset with prolongation of the PR interval;\n* Altered rate with resolution of temporary bundle branch block;\n* Esophageal or electrophysiology study confirming tachycardia mechanism.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Failure to obtain consent;\n2. Known hypersensitivity to either study medication or suspension;\n3. Structural heart disease other than a patent foramen ovale or patent ductus arteriosus;\n4. Persistent abnormal cardiac function documented by echocardiogram (shortening fraction \\<28%) in sinus rhythm;\n5. Pre-excitation (Wolff Parkinson White syndrome);\n6. Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia;\n7. Ectopic atrial tachycardia;\n8. Atrial flutter;\n9. Sick sinus syndrome or significant bradycardia;\n10. Long QT syndrome;\n11.
