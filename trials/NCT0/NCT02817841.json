Participants were asked to rate 16 different items on a 5-point scale where score 1 = very poor and score 5 = very good. The last two items - item 15 rating \"satisfaction with medicine\" and item 16 rating \"overall life satisfaction over the past week\" are two global items that are scored individually. For both items, a higher score is associated with a better outcome.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.2","spread":"0.69"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.75"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.77"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in the Score of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ)","description":"The MDQ is a standard method for measuring cyclical perimenstrual symptoms.
