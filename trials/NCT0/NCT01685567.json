The MICHI NPS+f also facilitates access to the carotid and neuro anatomy for the introduction of therapeutic or diagnostic endovascular devices and/or agents. It will be used in conjunction with a FDA approved carotid artery stent for the treatment of carotid artery disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hierarchical Composite of Stroke, Myocardial Infarction, and Death","timeFrame":"30-day post-procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intention-to-Treat (ITT)","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26506270","28335706","36563712","30611582"],"seeAlso":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26506270","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28335706"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":219},"commonTop":["Pain","Hypotension","Urinary Retention","Pyrexia","Artery Dissection"]}}
