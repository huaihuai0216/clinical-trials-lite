English speaking\n3. be able to tolerate wrist actigraphy (wear a watch on their wrist for a month)\n4. diagnosed with dementia using standard assessments and diagnostic criteria\n5. has CG reporting the presence of CRD symptoms\n6. If the CR is on any of four classes of psychotropic medications (antidepressant, benzodiazepines, antipsychotic, or anti-convulsant) or an anti-dementia medication (memantine or a cholinesterase inhibitor), we will require that the CR have been on a stable dose for 90 days prior to enrollment (typical time frame in clinical trials) to minimize possible confounding effects of concomitant medications\n\nInclusion criteria for caregiver (CG):\n\n1. CG is at least 18 years old\n2. CG lives close to the participant\n3. CG is planning to live in the area for at least 6 months\n4. If CG is on a psychotropic medication, CG must be on a stable dose for at least 60 days\n\nExclusion criteria for CR:\n\n1. deemed to be in a crisis/unsafe situation at baseline\n2. reported planned transition to another residential or care setting in less than 6 months\n3. at end-stage disease (defined as bed-bound and noncommunicative, or on hospice at baseline)\n4. currently enrolled in an interventional clinical trial for dementia or associated symptoms\n5. regular use of medications with substantial known effects on the measurement of HPA activity (e.g. corticosteroids, interferons, beta-blockers, cytotoxic chemotherapy)\n6. major surgery in the past 3 months\n7. history of major psychiatric and/or personality disorder\n8. history of heavy cigarette smoking (e.g. than 50 pack years)\n9. loss of a loved one in the past 3 months\n10. conditions known to affect measurement of circadian rhythm such as use of sedatives/ hypnotics, Huntington's disease, Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease, advanced heart failure (New York Heart Stage 3-4), morbid obesity (BMI 35)","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"110 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) Scale","description":"Person living with dementia quality of life. The QOL-AD scale uses a scale of 1-4 (poor, fair, good, or excellent) to rate a variety of life domains, including the patient's physical health, mood, relationships, activities, and ability to complete tasks. Total scores are calculated by summing all domain scores. The total score range is 13 to 52, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life. Total scores were analyzed to see if there was a change from baseline to one month. The change was calculated from two time points as the value at the later time point minus the value at the earlier time point.
