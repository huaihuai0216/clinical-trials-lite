In order to be eligible for the study, patients must have completed the double-blind phase of the NMS-Nab trial as responders within the last 2 months.\n2. For patients that completed NMS-Nab Study over 2 months prior to the Screening / Baseline Visit, and meet all other inclusion criteria, eligibility should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.\n3. Only patients without a drug-related serious adverse event (SAE) or (drug-related) moderate or severe AE during the NMS-Nab Study can be included in the study\n4. Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any study related procedure being performed. Patients with a legal guardian should be consented according to local requirements.\n5. Patients must be willing and able to take oral medication and able to comply with the study specific procedures.\n6. The patient is in good health as determined by medical examination and based on the investigator's judgement\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients with any of the following characteristics will be excluded from entering the study:\n\n1. Patients with PArkinson´s Disease (PD) who have not participated in the randomized double-blind phase of the previous NMS-Nab Study.\n2. Patients that experienced a drug-related SAE or had a (drug-related) moderate or severe AE during the NMS-Nab Study will be excluded in the study.\n3. Patients who are unable or unwilling to comply with the study procedures in the investigator´s opinion.\n4. Patients with any clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition at the Screening / Baseline Visit that may preclude safety and the completion of the study participation (based on the investigator's judgement).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"AEs in PD Patients Taking Nabilone, Between V 1 and V 3","description":"Safety and tolerability will be evaluated with reference to the following:\n\nAdverse Events (AE)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"39","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects (%) Who Discontinue the Study Due to an AE Between V 1 and V 3","description":"Safety and tolerability will be evaluated with reference to the following:\n\nNumber of subjects (%) who discontinue the study due to an AE The reasons for discontinuation will be grouped in \"discontinuation due to an AE\" and \"discontinuation due to other reasons\".
