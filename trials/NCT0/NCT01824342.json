Patients currently participating in the phase 3 study 20050147 (NCT00286091) will be offered this study if a positive benefit:risk compared with placebo is determined in the 20050147 study. The primary endpoint of the 20050147 study is bone metastases-free survival determined by the time to first occurrence of bone metastases (either symptomatic or asymptomatic) or death from any cause. Participants will receive open-label denosumab administered once every 4 weeks (Q4W) subcutaneously (SC) until they developed a bone metastasis or for up to 3 years, whichever comes first.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Deaths","timeFrame":"From the first dose of open-label denosumab until 4 weeks after the last; maximum time on study was 37 months.
