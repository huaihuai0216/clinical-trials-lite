Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, decitabine, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Midostaurin may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving azacitidine with or without nivolumab or midostaurin, or decitabine and cytarabine alone may kill more cancer cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) (Phase II)","timeFrame":"Day of registration on study until death from any cause, assessed for up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Azacitidine","deltaMin":6.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Azacitidine + Nivolumab","deltaMin":5.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Azacitidine +Midostaurin","deltaMin":7.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":36,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":506,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":25},"commonTop":["White blood cell decreased","Anemia","Constipation","Platelet count decreased","Fatigue"]}}
