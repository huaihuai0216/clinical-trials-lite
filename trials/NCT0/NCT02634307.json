Positive change from baseline indicates improved health.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.793","spread":"0.137"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.841","spread":"0.128"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.837","spread":"0.128"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.002","spread":"0.110"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.018","spread":"0.085"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.035","spread":"0.096"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.006","spread":"0.108"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.026","spread":"0.086"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.037","spread":"0.101"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.010","spread":"0.109"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.030","spread":"0.108"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.036","spread":"0.110"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.009","spread":"0.114"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.042","spread":"0.109"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.057","spread":"0.117"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Change From Baseline in the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Score","description":"The SF-12 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health.
