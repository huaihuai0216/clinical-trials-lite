Participant must voluntarily sign and date the informed consent form approved by an Independent Review Board or Ethics Committee prior to the initiation of any study-specific procedures.\n5. Participant completed the post-treatment period of an eligible prior study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. The investigator considers the participant unsuitable for the study for any reasons (e.g., failure to comply with study procedures in the prior AbbVie clinical study).\n2. Receipt of any investigational HCV antiviral treatment after receiving ABT-493 and/or ABT-530 in the prior study.\n3. Participants who experienced non-virologic treatment failure due to premature discontinuation of study drug in prior study of ABT-493/ABT-530.\n4.
