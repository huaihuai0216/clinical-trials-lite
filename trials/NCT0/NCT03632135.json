In all cases, the diagnosis must be confirmed by a pathologist.\n6. Recurrent surgically resectable tumor and/or biopsy;\n7. Participants who have undergone surgical resection should have received an MRI or a scan after surgery in order to visualize residual tumor. If not, the operative report must be available;\n8. Prior to surgery there was imaging evidence of measurable progressive disease (PD);\n9. Start of radiotherapy, if indicated, must occur at least 2 weeks after surgery and/or biopsy;\n10. Estimated survival of at least 3 months;\n11. Hgb \\> 9 gm; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\> 1500/Î¼l; platelets \\> 100,000; Creatinine \\< 1.5 times the upper limit of laboratory normal value; Bilirubin \\< 2 times the upper limit of laboratory normal value; serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) or serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) \\< 3 times the upper limit of laboratory normal value;\n12. If indicated radiation therapy and chemotherapy must start within 8 weeks of tumor resection or biopsy.\n13. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is allowed. If indicated it should be initiated at least 4 weeks post craniotomy or biopsy if the wound has healed well without any drainage or cellulitis;\n14. The use of herbal preparation or tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol is strongly discouraged, but not contraindicated;\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects with newly diagnosed GBM\n2.

History of another malignancy in the previous 2 years, with a disease-free interval of \\< 2 years. Patients with prior history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer, any time prior to screening, are eligible;\n8. OPTUNE device is not permitted in the study;\n9. Patients cannot participate to any clinical trials utilizing a liquid biomarker or imaging studies that impact the overall survival.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Median Overall Survival (OS)","description":"Overall survival (OS) in recurrent GBM patients who have had a ChemoID assay-guided treatment compared to standard therapy chosen by the physician.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Median Progression Free Survival (PFS)","description":"Median Progression Free Survival in recurrent GBM patients who have had a ChemoID assay-guided treatment compared to standard therapy chosen by the physician.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":35},"commonTop":["Low white blood cells count","Platelet count decreased","Fatigue","Neuropathy","Constipation"]}}}
