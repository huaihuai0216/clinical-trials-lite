Treated sleep apnea (e.g., Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, surgery) will not be exclusionary.\n* Allergy or previous adverse reaction to prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist.\n* Wounds requiring surgery, embedded shrapnel, and recent surgical amputation do not comprise an exclusion if the individual is otherwise medically eligible.\n* Women of childbearing potential with positive pregnancy test or refusal to use effective birth control method, or who are breastfeeding will be excluded.\n\nPsychiatric/Behavioral:\n\n* Meets DSM-IV criteria for current schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), delirium, or any DSM-IV cognitive disorder.\n* Exclusion for psychotic disorder is not to be confused with combat trauma-induced reexperiencing symptoms (transient dissociative states or flashbacks), which will not be exclusionary.\n* Substance dependence disorder within 3 months or any current substance dependence (stable methadone maintenance will not be exclusionary).\n* Current cocaine or stimulant abuse.\n* Severe psychiatric instability or severe situational life crises, including evidence of being actively suicidal or homicidal, or any behavior which poses an immediate danger to patient or others.\n* Nonsuicidal depression comorbid with PTSD will not be exclusionary (see below).\n\nMedications/Therapies:\n\n* Current use of prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist.\n* Previous adequate trial of prazosin for PTSD.\n* Subjects on trazodone will undergo a 2-week washout period before baseline assessment. (Combining prazosin and trazodone may increase risk of priapism).\n* Sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra) will be not be permitted during the study dose titration period because of increased risk of hypotension in combination with alpha-1 blockers. Following achieving stable dose of study drug, sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil will be permitted at 1/2 the usual starting dose.\n* Stimulants or alternative medications with stimulant properties (e.g., ephedra).\n* Recent exposure therapy and/or Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprogramming (EMDR). These therapies must have been completed \\> 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Other psychotropic medications and/or maintenance psychotherapy at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks will not be exclusionary.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"CAPS Recurrent Distressing Dreams Item","description":"Change from baseline in frequency and/or severity of combat trauma-related nightmares will be assessed by the CAPS Recurrent Distressing Dreams item.
