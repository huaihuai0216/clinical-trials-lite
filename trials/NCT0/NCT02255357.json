The main objective is to test whether intranasal Oxytocin could reduce relapse risk by reducing stress sensitivity. To measure the stress sensitivity, this study will evaluate a new stress challenge: a) Intranasal desmopressin, a vasopressin analog, will be used an endocrine stressor; its effects will be evaluated by serial measurements of serum Adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and self reports; b) if pretreatment with intranasal oxytocin dampens the ACTH and subjective response to intranasal desmopressin. These measures will be tested during a 7-day inpatient abstinence induction hospitalization. For those patients with family and work obligations, an outpatient abstinence induction procedure is available. The response to the desmopressin challenge will be compared to a cohort of matched control subjects. After abstinence induction, cocaine dependent patients enter a 6-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 24 IU of intranasal oxytocin vs. placebo, to monitor if this reduces the relapse risk.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Weeks of Abstinence From Cocaine","timeFrame":"Phase 1: 7 days; Phase 2: 6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo for Phase 2, Clinical Trial","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intranasal Syntocinon for Clinical Trial Phase 2","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17526941","18655903","19934046","15290695","9256988"],"seeAlso":["http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/pitocin?druglabelid=1666&mode=preview","http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/ddavp-nasal-spray?druglabelid=1034&mode=preview"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["headache","feeling energized","feeling woozy","nausea","cough"]}}
