Patients will be randomized to receive tocilizumab 4 mg/kg IV, tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV or placebo IV, every 4 weeks. All patients will also receive methotrexate, 10-25 mg/week. The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years and the target sample size is 500+ individuals. After completion of the 2 year study participants could participate in the optional 3 year open label extension phase (year 3 to 5).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology-ACR20 Response","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo + Methotrexate","deltaMin":27,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 4 mg/kg + Methotrexate","deltaMin":50.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + Methotrexate","deltaMin":56.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":152,"countries":["United States","Australia","Brazil","China","Denmark","Finland","France","Greece","Italy","Mexico","Norway","Poland","Puerto Rico","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27564431","27087059","26787505","24429164","23945134","23322466","22491018","21360490"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":392},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Bronchitis","Hypertension","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
