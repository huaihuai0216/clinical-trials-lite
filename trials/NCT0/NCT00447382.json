The aim of this trial was to make a safety comparison of insulin detemir produced by a new production method (NN729) with insulin detemir made by the previous production method (NN304). Subjects were treated with NN729 or NN304 for a period of 52 weeks at the same total daily dose and frequency of administration as their own pre-trial basal insulin . During the trial doses were individualised based on subject's plasma glucose measurements.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Insulin Detemir - Human Insulin Cross-reacting Antibodies","timeFrame":"week 0, week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NN304","deltaMin":1.81,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"NN729","deltaMin":1.89,"sd":0.07}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.649"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["Germany","North Macedonia","Russia","Serbia and Montenegro","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":164},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Influenza","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
