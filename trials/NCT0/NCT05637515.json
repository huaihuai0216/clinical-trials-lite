Able to understand and voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study\n2. Aged 18 to 75 years, inclusive, at the time of Screening\n3. Has moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months prior to screening and that has involved body surface area ≥10%, PASI ≥12, and static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥3 (moderate) at Screening and at Baseline\n4. Has stable disease for at least 2 months (i.e., without significant changes as defined by the principal investigator \\[PI\\] or designee)\n5. Is a candidate for systemic therapy or phototherapy\n6. Has a previous failure, inadequate response, intolerance, or contraindication to at least 1 conventional antipsoriatic systemic therapy, including methotrexate, cyclosporine, psoralen plus ultraviolet light A (PUVA), and ultraviolet light B (UVB)\n7. Willing to follow the contraception requirement, based on the childbearing potential.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects must not be enrolled in the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n1. Has been diagnosed with erythrodermic psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, medication-induced psoriasis, other skin conditions (e.g., eczema), or other systemic autoimmune disorder/ inflammatory disease at the time of the Screening visit that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of the study treatment of psoriasis\n2. Prior and concomitant medications: Has prior use of any of the medications specified in the CTP within specified time periods or will require use during the study:\n3. Has received live or attenuated vaccines during the 4 weeks prior to Screening or has the intention of receiving a live or attenuated vaccine at any time during the study\n4. Other medical conditions: Known chronic or relevant acute TB\n5. Has an underlying condition (including, but not limited to, metabolic, hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic, endocrine, cardiac, infectious, or gastrointestinal) which, in the opinion of the PI or designee, significantly immunocompromises the subject and/or places the subject at unacceptable risk for receiving an immunomodulatory therapy\n6. Has a planned surgical intervention during the duration of the study and which, in the opinion of the PI or designee, will put the subject at further risk or hinder the subject's ability to maintain compliance with study treatment and the visit schedule\n7. Has any active and serious infection or history of infections\n8. Is positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus antibody, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or is positive for hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) at Screening\n9. Has laboratory abnormalities, including but not limited to clinically significant hematological abnormalities, that, in the opinion of the PI or designee, could cause this study to be detrimental to the subject. The subjects should be excluded if they have the following laboratory abnormalities\n\n   1. Hemoglobin \\<9 g/dL\n   2. Platelet count \\<100 000/mm3\n   3. White blood cell count \\<3000 cells/mm3\n   4. Aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase that is persistently ≥2.5 × the upper limit of normal. (Persistently indicates elevated transaminases, at least on two separate occasions)\n   5. Creatinine clearance \\<50 mL/min (Cockcroft Gault formula)\n10. Has severe progressive or uncontrolled, clinically significant disease that in the judgment of the PI or designee renders the subject unsuitable for the study\n11. Has moderate to severe heart failure (New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] Class III/IV)\n12. Has a history of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of Humira or Hulio\n13. Is pregnant or nursing (lactating) woman\n14. Has evidence (as assessed by the PI or designee using good clinical judgment) of alcohol or drug abuse or dependency up to 5 years prior to Screening\n15. Is unable to follow study instructions and comply with the protocol in the opinion of the PI or designee.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Primary Endpoints: Pharmacokinetics (PK) - AUC","description":"AUCτ, 26-28 (Area under the adalimumab concentration-time curve \\[AUC\\] over the dosing interval of Week 26-28)","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2127.57","spread":"1432.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2357.61","spread":"1636.09"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Primary Endpoints: Pharmacokinetics (PK) - Cmax","description":"Cmax, 26-28 (Maximum observed adalimumab concentration during the dosing interval Week 26-28).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.69","spread":"4.96"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.46","spread":"5.42"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":193},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Pharyngitis"]}}}
