Several studies have investigated different methods of delivering cervical anesthesia prior to abortion, however to the best of the investigators' knowledge, there is no published data that 1) rigorously examines the effect of a time interval between local anesthetic administration and procedure initiation, or 2) explores whether adequate pain relief is possible through self-administered, non-invasive means alone. Research in this area has a significant public health impact, given the large number of women worldwide who seek abortions.\n\nThe investigators propose to explore the effect of a locally applied vaginal lidocaine gel in place of the traditional paracervical block prior to first trimester surgical abortion. They hypothesize that lidocaine gel is no worse than paracervical block at decreasing abortion related pain at a variety of time points throughout the procedure. This is a non-inferiority, open label, randomized controlled trial.\n\nIf self-administered vaginal gel is acceptable and effective, it would increase options for pain control during abortion and other gynecologic procedures.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Difference in Pain Level at Time of Cervical Dilation as Measured by a Visual Analog Scale","timeFrame":"At time of cervical dilation, 30 minutes after lidocaine administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Comparator","deltaMin":68,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Lidocaine Paracervical Block","deltaMin":65,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27400015"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":69},"commonTop":[]}}
