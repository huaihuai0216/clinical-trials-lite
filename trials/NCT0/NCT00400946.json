We have previously reported that patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in whom asparaginase treatment was discontinued because of intolerable side-effects had survival outcomes that were inferior to those who received all or nearly all of their intended doses. Two bacterial sources of asparaginase exist: Escherichia coli (E coli) and Erwinia chrysanthemia (Erwinia). Generally, the E coli-derived enzyme has been used as front-line therapy and the Erwinia-derived preparation has been reserved for patients who develop hypersensitivity reactions. Pegylated E coli asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) has a longer half-life and is potentially less immunogenic than native E coli L-asparaginase, and has been used as the initial asparaginase preparation in some pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment regimens.\n\nPURPOSE: Although the pharmacokinetics of each of these asparaginase preparations: intravenous PEG-asparaginase (IV-PEG) and intramuscular native E coli L-asparaginase (IM-EC) have been well characterized, their relative efficacy and toxicity have not been studied extensively.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Asparaginase-Related Toxicity Rate","timeFrame":"30-week post-induction asparaginase treatment period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intramuscular Native E Coli L-asparaginase (IM-EC)","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intravenous PEG-asparaginase (IV-PEG)","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".60"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20007809","26549586","29941458","29090520"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":132,"n":231},"commonTop":["Fracture","Pancreatitis","Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis)","Hypertension","Allergic reaction"]}}
