Please Note:\n\n  * Inactivated influenza (Flu) vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib) vaccines may be given at any time during the study, including the day of study vaccination (Flu and Hib vaccines must be administered at a different location than the study vaccine/s).\n  * Any age appropriate vaccine may be given starting at Visit 2 (or starting at Visit 3 for the US post-dose 2 sub-cohort), and anytime thereafter.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting 180 days prior to study vaccination at Visit 1 or planned administration from the date of vaccination through the immunogenicity evaluation at Visit 2, or at Visit 3 for the US post-dose 2 sub-cohort.\n* History of measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster and/or hepatitis A diseases.\n* Known exposure to measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella/zoster during the period starting 30 days prior to the first study vaccination.\n* Previous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A and/or varicella virus.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines, including hypersensitivity to neomycin, latex or gelatin.\n* Blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrollment. Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever. Fever is defined as temperature ≥38°C/100.4°F by any age appropriate route.
