It comprises 13 items (grouped under the subcategories of attention, deportment, quality of work, and compliance) on which subjects are rated according to a 7-point scale (0 = normal to 6 = maximal impairment) by trained study personnel (Swanson 1998). The SKAMP-C score was obtained by summing the rating values for each of the 13 items (range: 0-78), with higher scores indicating greater impairment.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.87","spread":"0.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.536","spread":"0.70"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) Rating Scale, Number of Problems Attempted (PERMP-A)","description":"The PERMP is an adjusted math test designed to assess attention in children with ADHD (Swanson 1999). The test measures attention through a subject's ability to initiate, self-monitor, and complete the math test. A Placement PERMP was performed early in the trial to assure that subjects could complete at least the basic level of math problems and to determine the appropriate level of math to be assigned during the remainder of the study. The PERMP is an individually calibrated 5-page mathematics worksheet consisting of 400 problems. PERMP-A scores document the number of problems attempted, from 0 to 400, and thus higher scores represent a better outcome.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.82","spread":"3.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.25","spread":"3.05"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":155},"commonTop":["Decreased appetite","Insomnia","Affect lability","Abdominal pain upper","Headache"]}}}
