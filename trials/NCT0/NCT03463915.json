IC/BPS affects women more often than men. How the disorder develops is not completely known. Bladder instillation is a commonly used treatment in which a mixture of different ingredients are passed into the bladder to help IC/BPS symptoms. There is room to learn more about bladder instillations and which ingredients in them work best. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a bladder instillation that contains a steroid (triamcinolone acetonide) to a bladder instillation that does not contain a steroid to treat IC/BPS in women. The study hypothesis is that women with IC/BPS treated with bladder instillations that contain a steroid will have improved outcomes compared to women treated with bladder instillations that do not contain a steroid.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Treatment Response as Measured by the Total Score on the O'Leary-Sant Questionnaire","timeFrame":"Assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks; change from baseline to week 6 reported","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bladder Instillation WITH Triamcinolone Acetonide","deltaMin":-6.7,"sd":7.1},{"arm":"Bladder Instillation WITHOUT Triamcinolone Acetonide","deltaMin":-5.8,"sd":8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15592041","15049588","11346323","9146002","23234637","9201654","17943887","26272202","22786518","26816864","26590137","15711286","19364425","33831942","32734597"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":45},"commonTop":["Urethral pain","Urinary tract infection","Anxiety attack","Strong bladder spasms"]}}
