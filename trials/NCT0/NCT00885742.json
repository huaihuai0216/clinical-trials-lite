Factor XIII Concentrate is given to patients whose blood is lacking factor XIII. Factor XIII Concentrate works by assisting blood in the usual clotting process, thereby preventing bleeding.\n\nIn this study, patients will be treated with FXIII Concentrate (Human) and followed closely to determine that they receive the dose that will best minimize the chance of bruising and bleeding.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Incidence of Spontaneous Bleeding Events Requiring Treatment (Treatment is Defined as Administration of a FXIII-Containing Product to Treat the Bleeding Event)","timeFrame":"Up to week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FXIII","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25377187"],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00883090?term=FXIII&rank=2","http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00945906"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":41},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory infection","Fever","Cough","Fall","Nasal congestion"]}}
