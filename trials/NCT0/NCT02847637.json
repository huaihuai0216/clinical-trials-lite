The 72-hour rule was implemented: two bleeds of the same type and at the same anatomical location were counted as one bleed if the second bleed occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first bleed. Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were excluded. For participants with dose up-titration or a change in emicizumab dosing regimen (after implementation of protocol v4), the efficacy period ended the day before the first day on the up-titrated dose or changed dosing regimen.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Anti-Emicizumab Antibodies at Any Time Post-Baseline During the Study","description":"A validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to analyze the levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against emicizumab in plasma.
