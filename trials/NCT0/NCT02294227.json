Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score.
