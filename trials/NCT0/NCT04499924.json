This study will also look at what side effects happen when participants take this combination of drugs. A side effect is anything the drug does other than treating cancer.\n\nStudy treatment will be given in 28-day cycles.\n\nIn the Phase 2 part of the trial, participants and their doctors will know what drugs are being given (open-label). In the Phase 3 part, the study is \"blinded.\" This means that participants, their doctor, and the study sponsor will not know which drugs are being given.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT) During the First Cycle of Treatment","timeFrame":"Cycle 1 (28 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","South Korea","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":8},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Epistaxis"]}}
