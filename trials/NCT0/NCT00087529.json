treatment with rituximab (MabThera(R)/Rituxan(R))\n* Previous treatment with lymphocyte-depleting therapies (e.g., cyclophosphamide, Campath(R), anti-CD4, cladribine, total body irradiation, bone marrow transplantation), except mitoxantrone, which should not be used 12 months prior to randomization\n* Treatment with an investigational agent within 90 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug (whichever is longer) prior to randomization\n* Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to randomization\n* Systemic corticosteroid therapy within 30 days prior to randomization\n* Treatment with IFN-\\&#x3B2;, glatiramer acetate, IVIg, or plasmapheresis within 60 days prior to randomization\n* Treatment with non-lymphocyte-depleting immunosuppressive therapies (e.g.,

Those who did not meet criteria for CDP, completed treatment with only initial progression, or received an exclusionary therapy were censored at last EDSS assessment.
