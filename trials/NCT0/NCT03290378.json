As higher pain scores indicate worse pain, a negative Pain Intensity Difference (PID) indicates less pain (improvement from baseline). Thus, SPID scores are expected to be negative if a patient's pain decreases over time, with the lower SPID values indicating greater reduction in pain intensity.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-122.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-110.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-97.8","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":140},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Headache","Dizziness","Infusion Site Pain"]}}}
