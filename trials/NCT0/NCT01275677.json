Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with trastuzumab in treating breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Alive and Free From Invasive Disease (IDFS)","timeFrame":"5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Chemotherapy)","deltaMin":89.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Chemotherapy, Trastuzumab)","deltaMin":89.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":25,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":1283,"countries":["United States","Canada","Ireland","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31821109"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":1615},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Fatigue","Nausea","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Diarrhea"]}}
