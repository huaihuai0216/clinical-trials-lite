therefore, the local pathology department policy regarding release of tumor samples must be considered in the screening process; patients whose tumor samples are located in a pathology department that by policy will not submit any samples for research purposes should not be approached for participation in the B-47 trial\n* The patient must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines\n* Eastern Cooperation Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1\n* The tumor must be unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination\n* All of the following staging criteria (according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer \\[AJCC\\] Cancer Staging Manual) must be met:\n\n  * By pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be pT1-3\n  * By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN0, pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN2b, pN3a, or pN3b\n\n    * If pN0, one of the following criteria must be met:\n\n      * pT2 and estrogen receptor (ER) negative and progesterone receptor (PgR) negative;

all testing performed must indicate that the tumor is HER2-low as defined below\n\n  * IHC must be performed and the IHC staining results must indicate a score of 1+ (in situ hybridization \\[ISH\\] testing is not required) or 2+ (ISH must also be performed and must indicate that the tumor is HER2-low as described below)\n  * If ISH testing is performed, test results must be as follows and IHC must be 1+ or 2+: the ratio of HER2 to chromosome enumeration probe 17 (CEP17) must be \\< 2.0 or, if a ratio was not performed, the HER2 gene copy number must be \\< 4 per nucleus\n  * Note: If the IHC staining intensity is reported as a range, e.g., 0 to 1+ or 1+ to 2+, the higher intensity score in the range should be used to determine eligibility\n* The patient must have undergone either a total mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy); (patients who have had a nipple-sparing mastectomy are eligible)\n* For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as determined by the local pathologist; if pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins; if tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible; (patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ \\[LCIS\\] are eligible without additional resection)\n* For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor;

or\n  * Axillary lymphadenectomy with or without SN isolation procedures\n* The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer (treatment or staging) and randomization must be no more than 84 days\n* The patient must have ER analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization;
