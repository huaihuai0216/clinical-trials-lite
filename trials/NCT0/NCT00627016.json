Schatzki's ring (a ring of mucosal tissue near the lower esophageal sphincter) is acceptable.\n* Has another condition that could be the primary cause of the subject's sleep disturbance.\n* Evidence of uncontrolled, clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, metabolic, gastrointestinal, or endocrine disease or other abnormality (other than the disease being studied) which may impact the ability of the subject to participate or potentially confound the trial results.\n* Diagnosis of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma) within 5 years of screening.\n* Has a condition likely to require surgery during the study.\n* Currently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n* Abnormal clinical laboratory values.\n* History of alcoholism or drug addiction.\n* Subject who works the night shift.\n* Subject who is planning to travel beyond 3 time zones during the study.\n* Chronic use (more than 12 doses/month) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2) inhibitors within 30 days prior to randomization or anticipated use during the study.\n* Use of the following medications during the 14 days prior to randomization or anticipated use during the study: proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate, misoprostol, corticosteroids, prokinetics, anticoagulant therapy, antiseizure medications (other than stable doses), psychotropic medications (other than stable doses), narcotic medications (occasional use allowed), bisphosphonates.\n* Use of sleep medications, first generation antihistamines, benzodiazepines, modified cyclic antidepressants, antianxiety medications or drugs with significant anticholinergic effects such as tricyclic antidepressants or drugs with central nervous system effects that could mask perception of symptoms (eg, selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However, subjects who remain on a stable regimen and dose of these medications during the 90 days prior to randomization and who agree to maintain the same regimen and dose during the trial will qualify. Also, short term use of anticholinergics for trial related procedures is not exclusionary. Second generation antihistamines are not excluded.\n* Use of histamine (H2) receptor antagonists or antacids (except for trial supplied Gelusil) during the screening period or anticipated use during the treatment period.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Median Percentage of Nights Without Heartburn Over 4 Weeks as Assessed by Daily Diary.","description":"Percentage calculated by the number of heartburn-free nights out of the total number of nights during the treatment period with a diary entry indicating presence or absence of nighttime heartburn in subjects who had â‰¥1 diary entry indicating presence or absence of nighttime heartburn, as indicated by the subject's daily diary.
