The vaccine will be given to healthy subjects who do not have a smallpox scar.\n\nApproximately 1110 subjects will be randomly enrolled into one of three groups:\n\nGroup 1 will include 370 subjects, who will receive two separate injections (shot) with a short needle, given below the skin of the upper arm with 0.5 mL FD MVA-BN (Lot 1).\n\nGroup 2 will include 370 subjects, who will receive two separate injections (shot) with a short needle, given below the skin of the upper arm with 0.5 mL FD MVA-BN (Lot 2).\n\nGroup 3 will include 370 subjects, who will receive two separate injections (shot) with a short needle, given below the skin of the upper arm with 0.5 mL FD MVA-BN (Lot 3).\n\nThe primary objective of the trial is to show that the immune response elicited (produced) by three consecutively produced MVA-BN lots are statistically (numerically) comparable.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Vaccinia-Specific Neutralizing Antibodies Measured by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT)","timeFrame":"Two weeks post second vaccination; approximately Week 6.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GP 1: Two Doses of FD MVA-BN--Lot 1","deltaMin":252.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"GP 2: Two Doses of FD MVA-BN--Lot 2","deltaMin":269.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"GP 3: Two Doses of FD MVA-BN--Lot 3","deltaMin":242,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36460535"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":377},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Injection site swelling","Injection site induration","Injection site pruritis"]}}
