Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating patients who are receiving radiation therapy and fluorouracil either before or after surgery for rectal cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"3-year Overall Survival Rate","timeFrame":"assessed every 3 months withihn 2 years of study entry, every 6 monhts between years 3-5 and then annually for 5 years, estimated at 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Irinocetan (Arm I)","deltaMin":0.965,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oxaliplatin (Arm II)","deltaMin":0.843,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control (Arm III)","deltaMin":0.87,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.35"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.69"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":62,"n":123},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Anemia","Nausea","Diarrhea w/o prior colostomy","Leukocytes decreased"]}}
