Children without advanced fibrosis and without cirrhosis will be randomized 2:1 to treatment Group A, receiving Pegasys 45-180 mcg subcutaneously weekly for 48 weeks, or to the untreated control Group B. Children with advanced fibrosis will be assigned to treatment group C and receive 48 weeks of treatment with Pegasys. Children in the untreated control Group B who have not experienced seroconversion 48 weeks after randomization may enter the Switch Arm to receive 48 weeks of Pegasys treatment. This offer will be available for 1 year following 48 weeks from randomization. Anticipated time on study treatment is 48 weeks. All subjects will be followed up for 5 years after the end of treatment (A,C,Switch)/principal observation (B) period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With HBeAg Seroconversion at 24 Weeks After End of Treatment (EOT)/POP in Groups A and B","timeFrame":"FU Week 24 (up to 72 weeks overall)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A: PEG-IFN Monotherapy Without Advanced Fibrosis","deltaMin":25.7,"sd":17.56},{"arm":"Group B: Untreated Control Without Advanced Fibrosis","deltaMin":6,"sd":1.25}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.0043"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.3732"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","China","Germany","Israel","Italy","Poland","Russia","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29689122"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":101},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Headache","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Abdominal pain","Asthenia"]}}
