Each item was given a weighted score(1 to 8 with higher score indicating increased activity)and summed if present at time of analysis. SLEDAI-2K score was sum of all 24 individual items from SLEDAI-2K, ranges from 0(no symptoms) to 105(presence of all defined symptoms). Higher scores indicates increased disease activity. A worsening was defined as an increase(compared to Baseline) in SLEDAI-2K score within same organ system at a post-Baseline visit. Baseline value was latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Percentage of participants with SLEDAI-2K organ worsening for following organ systems were reported;CNS total,Vascular total,Musculoskeletal total,Renal total,Mucocutaneous total,Cardio and Resp total,Immunologic total and Hematologic total.

From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment (PGA) by Visits","description":"The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) was a physician-reported visual analogue scale that provides an overall measure of the participant's current disease activity. Physician's Global Assessment was collected on a 10 centimeter (cm) visual analogue scale (VAS) by placing a mark on the scale between 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity). The PGA score was then rescaled for reporting by multiplying the collected score by 3 divided by 10. Hence, the PGA score ranges from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating greater disease activity. Baseline value was the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.
