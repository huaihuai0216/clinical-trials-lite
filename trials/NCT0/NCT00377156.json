Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiation therapy is more effective with or without whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying stereotactic radiation therapy and whole-brain radiation therapy to see how well they work compared with stereotactic radiation therapy alone in treating patients with brain metastases.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Neurocognitive Progression as Measured by the Number of Participants With Cognitive Deterioration by 3 Months","timeFrame":"3 months post radiosurgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (SRS)","deltaMin":40,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (SRS+WBRT)","deltaMin":44,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":64,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28939223","27458945"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":68},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Nausea","Peripheral motor neuropathy","Cognitive disturbance","Vomiting"]}}
