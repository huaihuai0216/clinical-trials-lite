The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (q.d.) reduces A1C more than the addition of placebo in participants with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control on acarbose monotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":-0.76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28035868"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":191},"commonTop":[]}}
