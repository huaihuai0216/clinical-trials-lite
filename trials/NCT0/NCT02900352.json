Other specific exclusionary disorders include;\n* History of clinically significant renal calculi or renal failure; a significant indication of renal compromise will be defined by an elevation of serum creatinine above the investigators' laboratory's limit of normal, or a known history of renal failure or chronic renal disease, or any current or chronic disease that could reasonably be expected to result in renal failure\n* History of hypersensitivity to ZNS or any sulfonamide, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, penicillin allergy, or history of any severe drug allergic reaction; History of systemic autoimmune disease such as lupus erythematosis, fibromyalgia, or rheumatoid arthritis;\n* Current blood dyscrasia or a history of such, with the exception of a past history of iron deficiency anemia\n* History of seizure disorder\n* Use of any of a number of medications that might prominently influence drinking patterns or cause risk of harm or injury (e.g., topiramate, disulfiram, naltrexone, acetazolamide, stimulants such as amphetamine, or tramadol; Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, PTSD, or substantial suicide or violence risk (i.e., can't be managed safely in the outpatient setting) on the basis of history or psychiatric examination; j) currently dependent on opioids or benzodiazepines or other sedatives\n* Considered by the investigators to be clinically inappropriate for study participation or have participated in another pharmacotherapy study in the past thirty days\n* Subjects with prominent signs of physical dependence, and/or medical comorbidities such that study physicians feel they should consider immediate detoxification, and referred for medical detoxification in a normal treatment setting","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Drinks Per Week","description":"Difference between groups in the number of total standard drinks per week over 8 weeks (weeks 9-16, the weeks on the target dose) performed using a mixed models longitudinal analysis.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.7","spread":"2.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23.7","spread":"1.98"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects With No Heavy Drinking Days","description":"percentage of subjects with no heavy drinking days (PSNHDD) The PSNHDD can be derived from each subject's Timeline Followback (TLFB) data.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.97","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.13","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) Levels","description":"Difference between groups on levels of GGT over time from baseline to endpoint, which will includes two interim data points for a total of four time points.
