Other aims are to check how well icatibant controls HAE symptoms in these children and teenagers, and how much icatibant stays in their blood.\n\nAt the first visit, the study doctor will check if each child or teenager can take part. For those who can take part, participants and their parents or caregivers will visit the clinic or hospital when they have their next HAE attack. Participants will receive 1 injection (shot) of icatibant in a vein and will stay at the clinic or hospital until their HAE symptoms are under control. Participants can receive up to 2 more injections of icatibant over time if their HAE symptoms don't improve or get worse.\n\nAfter the participants go home, the study staff will follow up with them by a telephone call 1 to 2 days later. Then, the participants will visit the clinic or hospital 1 week after they received the icatabant injection.\n\nThe participant can visit the clinic or hospital and be treated with icatibant in the same way for up to 3 HAE attacks in total.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TAK-667 10-30 mg","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5ff6d454565ce300294c6abc"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":2},"commonTop":[]}}
