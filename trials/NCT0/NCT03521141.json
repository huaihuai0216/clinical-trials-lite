Participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 groups; (1) group one informs selection of medication with information on nicotine metabolism; (2) group two offers a genetically-informed lung cancer risk score, and (3) group 3 is Guideline-Based Care (GBC). All groups will be followed for 6 months. All RCT participants will receive FDA-approved smoking cessation medication, be referred to the shared TN/MS state quitline, and be offered the NCI \"Clearing the Air\" standard intervention. The primary outcome is feasibility of delivering the precision interventions in the SCCS population, as evidenced by ability to recruit, engage, and retain participants through end of study. Secondary outcomes, for which the study is not powered, will include risk perceptions, use of quit aids, lung cancer screening among those who are eligible, and smoking cessation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Intervention Feasibility: Ability to Retain Participants","timeFrame":"Full trial: Baseline - 6 month survey","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Guideline-Based Care (GBC)","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nicotine Metabolite Ratio (PC-NMR)","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Respiragene (PC-Respiragene)","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38491559"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":["Insomnia and/or other sleep","Agitation and/or Irritability","Depressed mood","Cough","Anger"]}}
