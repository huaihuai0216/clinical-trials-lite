Using 6 questions, it yields four types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work), work productivity loss (overall work impairment), and activity impairment, with outcomes expressed as impairment percentages. Percentage work time missed absenteeism: Q2/(Q2+Q4)\\*100, Percentage impairment while working presenteeism: Q5/10\\*100; Percentage overall work impairment work productivity loss: Q2/(Q2+Q4)+\\[(1-Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)\\]\\*100; Percentage activity impairment activity impairment: Q6/10\\*100. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity, that is, worse outcomes.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.2","spread":"23.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-6.7","spread":"26.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-6.5","spread":"22.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.9","spread":"12.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.9","spread":"31.4"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-2.3","spread":"29.5"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.1","spread":"26.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-12.0","spread":"24.0"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-10.5","spread":"24.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-7.1","spread":"30.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-11.4","spread":"24.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-15.6","spread":"25.4"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.2","spread":"27.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-13.7","spread":"26.7"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-12.3","spread":"24.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.0","spread":"33.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-13.2","spread":"27.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-14.8","spread":"32.4"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.4","spread":"22.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-16.0","spread":"25.5"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-18.1","spread":"24.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-15.7","spread":"25.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-20.8","spread":"23.7"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-25.8","spread":"25.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Population Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration at Steady State of Dosing (Cmax,ss) of Baricitinib","description":null,"paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"Geometric Coefficient of Variation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"65.6","spread":"21.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"130","spread":"19.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Population PK: Area Under the Concentration Curve Versus Time at a Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUCtau,ss) of Baricitinib","description":null,"paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"Geometric Coefficient of Variation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"615","spread":"43.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1140","spread":"38.7"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":176},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Nausea"]}}}
