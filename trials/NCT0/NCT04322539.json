EQ-5D VAS was used to record participant's rating for his/her current health-related quality of life state on a vertical VAS with scores ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 = worst imaginable health state and 100 = best imaginable health state. The higher the score the better the health status. A negative change from baseline value represents patient condition worsened. Change from baseline in the EQ-5D-5L VAS scores was performed by visit (i.e. cycle), using a REML-based MMRM approach.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.3","spread":"1.38"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.9","spread":"1.69"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.1","spread":"1.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.5","spread":"2.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.0","spread":"1.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.1","spread":"2.79"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Health Utility Index Scores","description":"EQ-5D-5L consisted of 2 components: health state profile and optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile had 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problem, 2= slight problem, 3= moderate problem, 4= severe problem, and 5= extreme problem. The response levels collected from the EQ-5D-5L five dimensions as a health profile are converted into an EQ-5D-5L index (utility) scores to represent participants' utility value. The range of health utility index score is from -0.285 to 1, where higher value indicates perfect health and a negative value represents a state worse than dead. Change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L health utility index scores was performed by visit (i.e., cycle), using a REML-based MMRM approach.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":"0.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":"0.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.1","spread":"0.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":"0.03"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Health Care Resource Utilization: Duration of Hospital Visits by Participants","description":"Duration of hospital visit was calculated as = stop date - start date + 1.
