examples include, but are not limited to, treatment with \"4-drug induction\" (anthracycline, vincristine, asparaginase, and steroid), high dose cytarabine, anthracycline/cytarabine, ifosfamide/etoposide, and clofarabine-containing regimens\n  * Stem cell transplantation patients\n\n    * Planned to receive at least 1 myeloablative autologous or allogeneic HSCT\n    * For the purposes of this study, myeloablative autologous and allogeneic HSCT are those in which the conditioning regimen is predicted by the local Investigator to cause neutropenia for \\> 7 days\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\> 70 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 OR serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * 0.5 mg/dL (6 months to \\< 1 year of age)\n  * 0.6 mg/dL (1 to \\< 2 years of age)\n  * 0.8 mg/dL (2 to \\< 6 years of age)\n  * 1.0 mg/dL (6 to \\< 10 years of age)\n  * 1.2 mg/dL (10 to \\< 13 years of age)\n  * 1.5 mg/dL (male)/1.4 mg/dL (female) (13 to \\< 16 years of age)\n  * 1.7 mg/dL (male)/1.4 mg/dL (female) (\\>= 16 years of age)\n* Patients must have a performance status corresponding to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, or 2;
