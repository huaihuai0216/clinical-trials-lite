DAN affects the nerves that control heart rate and blood flow to the heart in people with diabetes. DAN may cause problems with the rhythm of the heartbeat or decrease blood flow to the heart. Three medications will be tested for their effectiveness in DAN.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Global [11C]HED Retention Index (RI)","timeFrame":"Baseline, 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ORAL ANTIOXIDANT","deltaMin":0.081,"sd":0.017},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.073,"sd":0.016}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.32"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.045"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23740194"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":22},"commonTop":["Non-Serious Adverse Events"]}}
