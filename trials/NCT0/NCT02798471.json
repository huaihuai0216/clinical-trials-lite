Male or female pediatric subjects between birth (defined as 38 weeks gestational age) and less than 18 years of age at the time of consent.\n2. Pediatric subjects with the presence of documented VTE confirmed by appropriate diagnostic imaging and requiring anticoagulant therapy for at least 90 days.\n3. Subjects must have received at least 5 days of heparin therapy prior to randomization to treat the newly identified index VTE. In addition, prior to being randomized to edoxaban or SOC, subjects initially treated with VKA are recommended to have an international normalized ratio (INR) \\< 2.0.\n4. Subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) or legally acceptable representative is informed and provides signed consent for the child to participate in the study.\n5. Female subjects who have menarche must test negative for pregnancy at Screening and must consent to avoid becoming pregnant by using an approved contraception method throughout the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subjects with active bleeding or high risk of bleeding contraindicating treatment with LMWH, SP Xa inhibitors, VKAs, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; identified high risk of bleeding during prior experimental administration of DOACs).\n2. Subjects who have been or are being treated with thrombolytic agents, thrombectomy or insertion of a caval filter for the newly identified index VTE.\n3. Administration of antiplatelet therapy is contraindicated in both arms except for low dose aspirin defined as 1-5 mg/Kg/day with maximum of 100 mg/day.\n4. Administration of rifampin is prohibited during the study and subjects on concomitant use of rifampin are excluded.\n5. Subjects with hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy leading to a clinically relevant bleeding risk (aPTT \\> 50 seconds or international normalized ratio \\[INR\\] \\> 2.0 not related to anticoagulation therapy) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\> 5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin \\> 2 × ULN with direct bilirubin \\> 20% of the total at Screening Visit.\n6. Subjects with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\< 30% of normal for age and size as determined by the Schwartz formula.\n7. Subjects with stage 2 hypertension defined as blood pressure (BP) systolic and/or diastolic confirmed \\> 99th percentile + 5 mmHg.\n8. Subject with thrombocytopenia \\< 50 × 109/L at Screening Visit. Subjects with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia may be enrolled in the study at the Investigator's discretion.\n9. Life expectancy less than the expected study treatment duration (3 months).\n10. Subjects who are known to be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n11. Subjects with any condition that, as judged by the Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk of harm if he/she participated in the study, including contraindicated medications.\n12. Subjects who participated in another clinical study or treated with an experimental therapy with less than a 30 day washout period prior to identifying the qualifying index VTE.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Day","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Symptomatic Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism During the Main Treatment Period Following Edoxaban or Standard of Care Treatment (Adjudicated Composite)","description":"Diagnosis of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) requires the confirmation by diagnostic imaging and at least one of the symptoms of VTE from such areas as lower or upper extremity, catheter related thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or sinovenous thrombosis.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Died as a Result of VTE During the Main Treatment Period Following Edoxaban or Standard of Care Treatment (Adjudicated Composite)","description":"Death from venous thromboembolism (VTE) is based on objective diagnostic testing, autopsy or death which cannot be attributed to documented cause for which VTE cannot be ruled out.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With No Change or Extension of Thrombotic Burden During the Main Treatment Period Following Edoxaban or Standard of Care Treatment (Adjudicated Composite)","description":"No change or extension of thrombotic burden as assessed by quantitative diagnostic imaging of the index qualifying VTE thrombus at baseline and at Month 3.
