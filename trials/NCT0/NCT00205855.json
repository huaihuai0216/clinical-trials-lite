Some include, but are not limited to, over-the-counter medications, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs, Physical Therapy, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and nerve blocks. Historically, the mainstay of pain treatment has been pharmacotherapy. However, pharmacotherapy has varying degrees of effectiveness and is often associated with undesirable side effects. Although many patients are successfully treated, for those who fail some of these more conservative therapies the remaining option is limited to spinal cord stimulation (SCS), proven to be an effective therapy to more than half of those failing conservative treatments . Over 50% of those who have failed these more conservative methods of pain management, can now, under the guidance of a clinician utilizing SCS, have their pain levels successfully managed. SCS is a less invasive therapy that is a reversible treatment with greater long-term benefits than more permanent, radical approaches and one that deserves greater consideration in the management of chronic, intractable pain.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score From Baseline to 2 Week Post Initial Fitting.","timeFrame":"2 weeks post initial fitting","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) Group","deltaMin":35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":65},"commonTop":["Device Malfunction","Lead Migration","Over and Under stimulation during SCS Trial","CSF leak","Unpleasant Stimulation"]}}
