History of mild persistent asthma symptoms (on average greater than 2 days per week with symptoms or albuterol use for symptoms or greater than 2 night-time awakenings per month during the year prior to study entry) and has been treated with a single-controller inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose less than or equal to 160 mcg per day of a beclomethasone-equivalent or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) (in an age-appropriate dose) for the 4 weeks prior to study entry; individuals treated with a combination controller therapy (e.g. ICS+LTRA or ICS+long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)) in the past 8 weeks will not be eligible\n  2. Not currently being treated with ICS, a history of mild persistent asthma, and 1 to 2 exacerbations in the year prior to study entry (but none in the 3 months prior to study entry)\n* Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) reversibility of greater than or equal to 12% following bronchodilator administration (4 puffs); individuals who do not meet this requirement may qualify for enrollment if their methacholine provocative concentration at 20% (PC20) is less than or equal to 12.5 milligrams per milliliter (mg/ml)\n* History of clinical varicella or varicella vaccine; individuals needing the vaccine may receive it from their primary care physician prior to study entry\n* Ability of parent to provide informed consent; verbal assent must be obtained from children less than 7 years of age and written assent must be obtained from children between 7 and 18 years of age\n* If female, willing to use an effective form of contraception\n\nParticipants will be eligible for the 44 weeks of treatment if, after the 4-week screening period, their asthma remains controlled, and they demonstrate at least 80% predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1. Participants must meet ALL of the criteria stated below during the 8-week screening period to continue in the study:\n\n* Meets the definition of acceptable asthma control, which is NOT having one or more of the following during ANY 2-week period:\n\n  1. On average, on more than 2 days per week, experiences one or more of the following:\n\n     1. Diary-reported symptoms\n     2. The use of inhaled bronchodilator (not including pre-exercise)\n     3. Peak flows in the yellow zone (less than 80% of personal best defined as based on peak expiratory flow (PEF) value obtained at study visit 1\n  2. More than 1 night-time awakening due to asthma\n* Demonstrates adherence with taking study medications (at least 75% of scheduled doses), rescue medications (using both rescue inhalers for at least 75% of rescue doses), and completing patient diaries (at least 75% of days)\n* Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 greater than or equal to 80% predicted at study visits 2 and 3\n* Agrees to not use a spacer with beclomethasone/placebo study and rescue medications\n\nNOTE: In January 2008, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) approved changes in the TREXA eligibility criteria, by which neither FEV1 reversibility ≥ 12% nor a participant's methacholine PC20 ≤ 12.5 mg/ml were required for randomization.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Corticosteroid treatment for any condition prior to study entry within the following defined timepoints:\n\n  1. Oral - Use within 2-week period of the screening visit\n  2. Injectable - Use within 2-week period of the screening visit\n  3. Nasal corticosteroids may be used at any time during the study at the discretion of the study investigator or primary care physician\n* Current or prior use of medications known to significantly interact with corticosteroid disposition (within a 2-week period of study visit 1), including but not limited to carbamazepine, erythromycin or other macrolide antibiotics, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, or ketoconazole\n* Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 less than 60% predicted at study visit 1\n* Any hospitalization for asthma in the year prior to study entry\n* Presence of chronic or active lung disease other than asthma\n* Significant medical illness other than asthma, including thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, hepatic disease, or concurrent medical problems that could require oral corticosteroids during the study\n* History of cataracts, glaucoma, or any other medical disorder associated with an adverse effect to corticosteroids\n* Any asthma exacerbation in the past 3 months or more than 2 in the past year.\n* History of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, or resulting in a hypoxic seizure\n* History of adverse reactions to ICS preparations or any of its ingredients\n* Receiving hyposensitization therapy other than an established maintenance regimen (continuous regimen for at least 3 months)\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Cigarette smoking or smokeless tobacco use in the year prior to study entry\n* Refusal to consent to a genotype evaluation\n* Current participation or participation within 1 month of study entry in another investigational drug trial\n* Evidence that the family may be unreliable or nonadherent, or may move from the clinical center area before study completion","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Years","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Participants Experiencing an Asthma Exacerbation That Requires Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"36","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change Between Week 44 and Week 0 in the Asthma Control Days","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.006","spread":"0.03"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.021","spread":"0.03"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.064","spread":"0.03"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.034","spread":"0.03"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change Between Week 44 and Week 0 in Rescue Albuterol Puffs Per Day","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.26","spread":"0.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.24","spread":"0.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.26","spread":"0.09"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.18","spread":"0.09"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change Between Week 44 and Week 0 in the Pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV!)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.104","spread":"0.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.113","spread":"0.04"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.097","spread":"0.05"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.063","spread":"0.04"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change Between Week 44 and Week 0 in the Morning Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.7","spread":"4.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.3","spread":"4.8"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"16.5","spread":"4.9"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"21.1","spread":"5.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change Between Week 44 and Week 0 in the Evening Peak Expiratory Flow Rate Variability (PEFR)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.2","spread":"4.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.9","spread":"4.4"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12.9","spread":"4.6"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"20.6","spread":"5.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change Between Week 44 and Week 0 Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) Variability","description":"PEFR variability represents the relative change between the evening and morning PEFR measurements, so it could be a positive or negative number.
