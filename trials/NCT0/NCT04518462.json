Healthy adult male or female volunteers ages 18 or older\n2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2, or 3\n3. Able to provide informed consent, adhere to the study schedule, and complete all study assessments\n4. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥18 and ≤40 kg/m2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Allergy, hypersensitivity, intolerance, or contraindication to any of the study medications for which an alternative is not named in the protocol (e.g., amide-type local anesthetics, opioids, bupivacaine HCl, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \\[NSAIDs\\])\n2. Concurrent painful physical condition that may require analgesic treatment (such as long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the post dosing period for pain and which, in the investigator's opinion, may confound the post dosing assessments\n3. History of, suspected, or known addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years\n4. Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives of such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration, or planned administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject's participation in this study\n5. Previous participation in an EXPAREL study\n6. Uncontrolled anxiety, schizophrenia, or other psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with study assessments or compliance\n7. Currently pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study\n8. Clinically significant medical disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation in a clinical study inappropriate. This includes diabetic neuropathy, coagulation or bleeding disorders, severe peripheral vascular disease, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction or other conditions that would constitute a contraindication to participation in the study.\n9.
