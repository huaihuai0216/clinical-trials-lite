Any disruptions in dosing during ATLAS2-M must be discussed with the Medical Monitor for a final determination of eligibility into the sub-study.\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA \\<50 copies/mL at Sub-Study Screening.\n\nInclusion criteria detailed for the ATLAS-2M main study apply to the sub-study:\n\n* A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin \\[hCG\\] test) not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies:\n\n  1. Non-reproductive potential defined as:\n\n     * Pre-menopausal females with one of the following:\n\n       i. Documented tubal ligation ii.

Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy\n     * Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea \\[in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.\n  2. Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication, throughout the study, for at least 30 days after discontinuation of all oral study medications, and for at least 52 weeks after discontinuation of CAB LA and RPV LA.\n* The investigator is responsible for ensuring that participants understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSub-study specific Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with more than 1 plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement \\>=50 copies/mL to \\<200 copies/mL (virologic blip) within 24 weeks prior to sub-study Screening visit.\n* Any Suspected Virologic Failure (HIV-RNA greater than \\[\\>\\]200 copies/mL as defined in during ATLAS-2M study.\n* Participants planning to require oral bridging during participation in the ATLAS-2M sub-study.\n* The participant has a tattoo or any dermatological condition overlying the thigh region which may interfere with interpretation of injection site reactions.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drugs or render the participant unable to receive study medication.\n\nExclusion criteria detailed for the ATLAS-2M main study apply to the sub-study:\n\n* Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study.\n* Any evidence of a current Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Stage 3 disease, except cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma not requiring systemic therapy, and Cluster of Differentiation 4 positive (CD4+) counts \\<200 cells per microliter are not exclusionary.\n* Participants with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.\n* Any pre-existing physical or mental condition (including substance use disorder) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the participant's ability to comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations or which may compromise the safety of the participant.\n* Participants determined by the Investigator to have a high risk of seizures, including participants with an unstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder. A participant with a prior history of seizure may be considered for enrollment if the Investigator believes the risk of seizure recurrence is low.
