Enrollment\n\n* Medications that are known to interact with POS or FLU and that may lead to serious or life threatening side effects within 7 days prior to initiating study drug;\n* Medications known to lower the serum concentration/efficacy of azole antifungals within 7 days prior to study drug start;\n* Prior investigational drug use or biologic product administration within 30 days before study
