Thus, treatment with high dose recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) may prevent kidney tissue damage and loss of renal function after successful kidney transplantation in humans.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kidney Graft Function by Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)","timeFrame":"42 days after transplantation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Erythropoietin","deltaMin":47,"sd":28},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":46,"sd":22}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":44},"commonTop":[]}}
