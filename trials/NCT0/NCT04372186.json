pneumonia confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of any specimen and radiographic imaging\n* SpO2 \\< 94% while on ambient air\n\nInclusion Criteria Specific to Long-Term Extension\n\n* Participated in Study ML42528 (EMPACTA) (includes participants who completed or discontinued early from the main study)\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Known severe allergic reactions to TCZ or other monoclonal antibodies\n* Require continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP), or invasive mechanical ventilation\n* Suspected active bacterial, fungal, viral, or other infection (besides COVID-19)\n* In the opinion of the investigator, progression to death is imminent and inevitable within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments\n* Immunocompromised (besides well-controlled HIV) or on immunosuppressive therapy (except for steroids for COVID), advanced cancer\n* Have received oral anti-rejection or immunomodulatory drugs (including TCZ) within the past 3 months\n* Participating in another interleukin (IL)-6 antagonist clinical trial or other drug clinical trials (participation in COVID-19 anti-viral trials may be permitted if approved by Medical Monitor)\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\> 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) detected within 24 hours at screening (according to local laboratory reference ranges)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\< 1000/uL at screening (according to local laboratory reference ranges)\n* Platelet count \\< 50,000/uL at screening (according to local laboratory reference ranges)\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding, or positive pregnancy test in a pre-dose examination\n* Treatment with an investigational drug within 5 half lives or 30 days (whichever is longer) of randomization (investigational COVID-19 antivirals may be permitted if approved by Medical Monitor)\n* Any serious medical condition or abnormality of clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study\n* Any history of Diverticulitis or GI perforation\n* Use of systemic corticosteroids unless on a stable chronic dose","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
