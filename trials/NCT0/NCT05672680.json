The endpoints include whether preoperative TAP blocks improve pain score (primary end point) and decrease opioid use (secondary endpoint) after an inguinal hernia repair. Other end points- complications after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Score at Rest","timeFrame":"on post-op days 1, 2, 3, and 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.31,"sd":2.46},{"arm":"Experimental","deltaMin":4.55,"sd":2.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":44},"commonTop":[]}}
