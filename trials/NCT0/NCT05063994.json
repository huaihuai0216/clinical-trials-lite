Note: females presenting with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea who are aged ≤55 years should be considered potentially fertile and therefore should undergo pregnancy testing like all other female participants.\n* Capable of giving signed informed consent/assent which includes compliance with requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatic or renal disease e.g. creatinine \\>2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or elevated liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] or aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\] \\>2 times the ULN).\n* History of bilateral adrenalectomy.\n* History of malignancy (other than basal cell carcinoma successfully treated \\>26 weeks prior to entry into the study).\n* Participants who have type 1 diabetes or receive regular insulin, have uncontrolled diabetes, or have a screening HbA1c greater than 8%.\n* Persistent signs of adrenal insufficiency or the participant does not tolerate treatment at the end of the 4-week run-in period.\n* Participants with any other significant medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the study.\n* Participants on regular daily inhaled, topical, nasal or oral steroids for any indication other than CAH.\n* Co-morbid condition requiring daily administration of a medication or consumption of any material that interferes with the metabolism of glucocorticoids.\n* Participants who are receiving \\<10 mg hydrocortisone dose at screening or the hydrocortisone dose equivalent.\n* Participants anticipating regular prophylactic use of additional steroids e.g. for strenuous exercise.\n* Participation in another clinical study of an investigational or licensed drug or device within the 12 weeks prior to screening.\n* Inclusion in any natural history or translational research study that would require evaluation of androgen levels during the study period outside of this protocol's assessments.\n* Participants who have previously been exposed to Chronocort in any Diurnal study.\n* Participants who routinely work night shifts and so do not sleep during the usual night-time hours.\n* Participants, who in the opinion of the Investigator, will be unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* Participants with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the Chronocort capsules, the Cortef tablets, or the placebo capsules.\n* Participants with congenital galactosemia, malabsorption of glucose and galactose, or who are lactase deficient.\n* Participants with a body weight of 45 kg or less.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16
