The MSFCS is based on the concept that scores for these three dimensions (arm, leg, and cognitive function) are combined to create a single score (the MSFC) that can be used to detect change over time in a group of participants with MS. Since the three primary measures differ in what they actually measure, a common composite score for the three different measures i.e., Z- score was selected for the purpose. MSFC Score = {Z arm, average + Z leg, average + Z cognitive} / 3.0. The results from each of these three tests are transformed into Z-scores and averaged to yield a composite score for each participant at each time point. A score of +1 indicates that, on average, an individual scored 1 standard deviation (SD) better than the reference population and a score of -1 indicates that an individual scored 1 SD worse than the reference population.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.001","spread":"0.033"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.026","spread":"0.034"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.169","spread":"0.029"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.276","spread":"0.028"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent Change in Brain Volume as Detected by Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) From Week 24 to Week 96 In Double Blind Period","description":"Brain volume was recorded as an absolute \"normalized\" value at the baseline visit then recorded at subsequent visits as a percentage change relative to the absolute value at the baseline visit.
