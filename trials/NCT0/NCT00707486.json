Additional follow-up visits may be scheduled at the discretion of the surgeon based on the severity of particular patient cases or the patient's need for earlier follow-up.\n* Extraction sites do not require primary closure or suturing\n* Willingness and ability to provide informed consent/ assent for participation\n* Patients with seafood allergies\n* Patients who have discontinued the use of anticoagulant medications (e.g., aspirin, coumadin, Plavix, etc.) for a minimum of 3 days prior to their planned surgical visit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure other than 3rd molar tooth extractions\n* Scheduled to undergo 2 extractions whereby one is an upper 3rd molar and the other is a lower 3rd molar. These will not reflect a proper index pairing for statistical calculations and data analysis based on anatomical similarities.\n* Extraction procedures are expected to require primary closure or suturing of the HemConÂ® Dental Dressing within the oral wound.\n* Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent/ assent for participation as a subject\n* Patients who are currently taking anticoagulant medications (e.g., aspirin, coumadin, Plavix, etc.) or have discontinued their anticoagulant medications less than 3 days prior to their surgical visit.\n* Patients who are undergoing bisphosphonate therapy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"14 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to Hemostasis","description":"This outcome measures the time it takes in minutes for the subject's extraction site to stop bleeding.
