Provided written informed consent signed by participant or legal guardian prior to entering the study or undergoing any study procedures (If the written informed consent was provided by the legal guardian because the participant was unable to do so, a written or verbal assent from the participant was obtained).\n3. Who was considered reliable and willing to be available for the study period and record seizures and report adverse events them self or have a caregiver who can record and report the events for them.\n4. Females who were either of non-childbearing potential (defined as having undergone surgical sterilization, or postmenopausal \\[\\>age 50 and amenorrheic for 12 months\\]) or of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential were enrolled only if they agreed to be abstinent or continue using at least 1 medically acceptable method of contraception (eg, a double-barrier method \\[eg, condom + spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide\\], IUD, or have a vasectomised partner) throughout the study period and for 2 months after the last dose of study drug. Women using hormonal contraceptives were required to use an additional approved method of contraception (as described previously) continuously throughout the entire study period and for 2 months after the last dose of study drug. (It was not required for male subjects to use contraceptive measures based on preclinical toxicology data).\n5. Continued to be treated with a stable dose of 1 or a maximum of 3 approved anti-epileptic drugs.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants who met the following criteria were excluded from the study:\n\n1\\.
