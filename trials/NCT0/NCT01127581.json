Biopsies, including cone biopsy of the cervix, are permitted;\n* Administration of oxytocin or any cervical ripening or labor inducing agents (including mechanical methods) or a tocolytic drug within 7 days prior to enrollment. Magnesium sulfate is permitted if prescribed as treatment for pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension;\n* Severe pre-eclampsia marked by Hemolytic anemia, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, other end-organ affliction or Central Nervous System (CNS) findings other than mild headache;\n* Fetal malpresentation;\n* Diagnosed congenital anomalies, not including polydactyly;\n* Any evidence of fetal compromise at baseline (e.g., non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern or meconium staining);\n* Amnioinfusion or other treatment of non-reassuring fetal status at any time prior to the induction attempt;\n* Ruptured membranes ≥ 48 hours prior to the start of treatment;\n* Suspected chorioamnionitis;\n* Fever (oral or aural temperature \\> 37.5°C);\n* Any condition in which vaginal delivery is contraindicated e.g., placenta previa or any unexplained genital bleeding at any time after 24 weeks during this pregnancy;\n* Known or suspected allergy to misoprostol, dinoprostone, other prostaglandins or any of the excipients;\n* Any condition urgently requiring delivery;\n* Unable to comply with the protocol.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18
