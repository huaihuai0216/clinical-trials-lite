Subjects in the NB and CLI group are required to undergo an evaluation to continue treatment at Week 16. Subjects are to be discontinued from full participation if they do not lose at least 5% of their body weight relative to baseline and/or are experiencing sustained increases in blood pressure (systolic or diastolic) of â‰¥10 mmHg above baseline. At Week 26, subjects originally assigned to Usual Care switch to treatment with NB and CLI, and subjects assigned to NB and CLI continue treatment for the duration of the study (78-weeks treatment period).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Body Weight From Baseline (Day 1) to Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NB + CLI","deltaMin":-9.46,"sd":0.54},{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":-0.94,"sd":0.49}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28026920"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":153},"commonTop":["Nausea","Anxiety","Headache","Insomnia","Dizziness"]}}
