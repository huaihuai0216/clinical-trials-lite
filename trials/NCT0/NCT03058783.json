EASI is composite score based on the evaluated severity of 4 key signs of AD (i.e., erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification), and the extent of disease in each of the 4 body regions (i.e., head/neck, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs). The area of involvement (affected by inflammation, not including dry skin) of each of the 4 body regions is determined and represented by a numeric coded value based on a scale from 0 to 6. The 4 body regions are assessed separately for each sign/symptom, and the average degree of severity of each sign in each of the 4 body parts is assigned a score of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) on a scale that allows half-unit increments. The EASI score ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores being worse.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.61","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26.18","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.45","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34.00","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Had at Least a 1 Grade Improvement From Baseline in the Severity of Pruritus Score and a Pruritus Score Equating to \"None\" or \"Mild\"","description":"Pruritis was assessed on a 4-point scale with 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and higher scores being worse.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.41","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.76","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"39.81","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":216},"commonTop":[]}}}
