Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Lapatinib may stop the growth of breast cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether fulvestrant is more effective with or without lapatinib in treating breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Interval from randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Lapatinib)","deltaMin":4.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Placebo)","deltaMin":3.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.37"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":27,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":368,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25348000"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":141},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Diarrhea","Nausea","Hot flashes","Rash acneiform"]}}
