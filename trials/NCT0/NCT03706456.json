The participant who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at least 6 months prior to the screening period according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Crohn's Disease issued by Research Group for Intractable Inflammatory Bowel Disease Designated as Specified Disease by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan (revised January 2017).\n4.
