In this study, participants will be people with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC for short). The main aim of the study is to learn if brigatinib stops the tumors from growing, or if the tumors have shrunk or disappeared, compared to a medicine called alectinib.\n\nAt the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants who can take part will be picked for 1 of 2 treatments by chance:\n\n* Brigatinib tablets\n* Alectinib capsules\n\nAll participants will take brigatinib or alectinib at about the same time every day. They will continue with treatment throughout the study unless their cancer gets worse, they have side effects from the treatment, they leave the study for certain reasons, or the study is stopped.\n\nAfter stopping treatment, participants will visit the study clinic for a check-up 30 days later.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) Per RECIST v1.1","timeFrame":"Up to 33.8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Brigatinib","deltaMin":19.253,"sd":null},{"arm":"Alectinib","deltaMin":19.187,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.8672"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":114,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Canada","Chile","China","Croatia","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Italy","Mexico","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37574132","34423676"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b601c4db2bf003ab493af"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":125},"commonTop":["Blood creatine phosphokinase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Anaemia","Lipase increased"]}}
