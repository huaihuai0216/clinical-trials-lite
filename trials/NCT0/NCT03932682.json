If subjects do not meet the criteria of the original inclusion criteria listed above, they should not receive additional vaccinations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Acute (severe) febrile illness. Enrollment could be considered if the fever is absent for 72 hours.\n* History of any anaphylaxis, serious vaccine reactions or hypersensitivity, including allergic reactions, to any component of vaccine or medical equipment whose use is foreseen in this study.\n* Clinical conditions representing a contraindication to intramuscular vaccination and blood draws. These may include known bleeding disorders, or treatment with anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding vaccination.\n* A known history of Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome or other demyelinating diseases such as encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis.\n* Abnormal function of the immune system resulting from a clinical condition\n* Received influenza vaccination or has had documented influenza disease in the last 6 months prior to informed consent.\n* Prior vaccination to prevent Neisseria meningitides serogroup C disease or prior infection caused by this organism.\n\nAdditional eligibility criteria
