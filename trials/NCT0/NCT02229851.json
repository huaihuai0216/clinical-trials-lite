A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.87","spread":"8.13"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.83","spread":"7.66"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.43","spread":"6.96"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.84","spread":"8.07"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.31","spread":"9.81"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.16","spread":"10.10"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.65","spread":"10.06"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.45","spread":"10.50"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.46","spread":"11.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.46","spread":"12.25"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.30","spread":"13.46"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.13","spread":"11.20"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.71","spread":"11.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.18","spread":"9.30"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8.16","spread":"12.77"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"4.16","spread":"8.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.80","spread":"10.55"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.66","spread":"8.12"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.12","spread":"13.02"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.70","spread":"10.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.84","spread":"10.36"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.44","spread":"10.29"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.56","spread":"10.34"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.57","spread":"11.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.41","spread":"8.57"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.47","spread":"10.29"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.51","spread":"9.57"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.30","spread":"11.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.46","spread":"7.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.32","spread":"7.70"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.66","spread":"9.67"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.20","spread":"8.66"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.66","spread":"6.91"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.98","spread":"7.24"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.06","spread":"7.07"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.81","spread":"7.72"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.51","spread":"10.39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.56","spread":"9.06"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.50","spread":"13.59"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.66","spread":"10.18"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"TSQM-9 Scores (Domain Scores) (Week 34)","description":"Scores from the TSQM-9 scale were calculated at the end of the main treatment period (week 34).
