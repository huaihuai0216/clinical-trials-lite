It is an antihistamine that reduces the harmful effects of histamine. The ophthalmic (eye drops) formulation of ketotifen has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been available in the United States for more than a decade. Oral (taken by mouth) ketotifen has been in available in other countries for several decades. Commonly prescribed for the maintenance treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis, ketotifen has long track record of safety. To date, the oral form of ketotifen has not been approved by the FDA, therefore this study is referred to as an \"investigational drug study.\" Prior to opening recruitment an \"investigational new drug\" (IND) application which included scientific data and information regarding human safety plans was submitted to and approved by the FDA.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Weekly Average Pain Score on the Visual Analog Scale at Week 10","timeFrame":"baseline and week 10","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ketotifen","deltaMin":-1.33,"sd":1.92},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.54,"sd":1.93}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":24},"commonTop":["Fatigue"]}}
