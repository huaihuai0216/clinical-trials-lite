Ongoing immunosuppressive illness.\n12. Clinically significant illnesses including: cardiac, hepatic, renal, endocrine, neurological, hematological, neoplastic, immunological, skeletal or other) that in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the safety, compliance or other aspects of this study.\n13. All types of malignancies except for basal and squamous cell (scaly or plate-like) skin cancer, in- situ cervical carcinoma must be in remission for a minimum of 5 years prior to Day 0.

Currently receiving or have received within the past 6 months (prior to Day 0):\n\n    * immunosuppressive drugs\n    * immunomodulatory drugs\n16. Currently receiving or have received oral or IV steroids within 14 days (prior to DAY 0) or expected to require oral or IV steroids during the study.\n17. Evidence of uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of \\>150 mmHg, and/or diastolic blood pressure of \\>100 mmHg).\n18. Heart rate \\>120/min.\n19. Weight \\> 95.5 kg\n20. History of IgA deficiency.\n21. Is positive for any of the following at screening: serological test for HIV 1\\&2, HCV or HBsAg.\n22. Presence of psychiatric disorder, other mental disorder or any other medical disorder which might impair the subject's ability to give informed consent or to comply with the requirements of the study protocol.\n23. Previous enrollment in this study.\n24. Participation in an interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to baseline visit (Day 0).\n25. Evidence of alcohol abuse or history of alcohol abuse or illegal and/or legally prescribed drugs in the past 2 years.\n26. Any other factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent the subject from complying with the requirements of the protocol.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Proportion of Subjects With Anti-rabies Antibody Titer of ≥0.5 IU/mL","description":"Non-inferiority in terms of the proportion of subjects with anti-rabies antibody titer of ≥0.5 IU/mL after study drug administration using a non-inferiority margin of 10%.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"73","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"72","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Analysis of AUC0-7d","description":"The AUC0-7d for BPL HRIG and vaccine versus comparator HRIG and vaccine using a non inferiority margin of 20%.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.32","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"RVNA Geometric Mean Titers at Days 3, 5, 7 and 14","description":"Comparison of the geometric mean titers (GMTs) for antirabies antibody titer after administration of BPL HRIG and vaccine versus comparator HRIG and vaccine.
