Male or female aged ≥18 years on the day informed consent is obtained\n2. A clinical history of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for two years or more with or without asthma\n3. A clinical history of severe allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (interfering with usual daily activities or sleep) induced by grass pollen, which remain troublesome despite symptomatic treatment with antihistamines, nasal steroids or eye drops during the previous grass pollen season\n4. Positive specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) (defined as ≥class 2, ≥0.70 kU/l) against grass: Phleum pratense\n5. Positive skin prick test to Phleum pratense at screening\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Has a clinically relevant history of symptomatic seasonal and/or perennial allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma caused by an allergen other than grass pollen, to which the subject is exposed, which could potentially overlap with the efficacy assessment periods\n2.
