The efficacy of daily Vytorin versus placebo in reducing the concentration of LDL-C will be evaluated, and the efficacy of daily Vytorin versus placebo with respect to change in the concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C will be compared. The safety of Vytorin versus placebo will also be assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) From Baseline to Endpoint After 8 Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline, 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vytorin 10/10","deltaMin":-41.69,"sd":2.06},{"arm":"Vytorin 10/20","deltaMin":-46.83,"sd":2.08},{"arm":"Vytorin 10/40","deltaMin":-49.1,"sd":2.07},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-7.53,"sd":2.04}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":97},"commonTop":[]}}
