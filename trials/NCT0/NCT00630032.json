Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving them after surgery may kill any tumor cells remaining after surgery. It is not yet known whether docetaxel is more effective than ixabepilone when given after surgery and combination chemotherapy in treating breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy followed by docetaxel or ixabepilone to compare how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for nonmetastatic breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Disease-free Survival (DFS)","timeFrame":"At 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Docetaxel","deltaMin":78.97,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ixabepilone","deltaMin":83.37,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.175"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":86,"countries":["United States","Belgium","France"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30267987"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":207,"n":398},"commonTop":["neutropenia","Alopecia","Nausea","Anemia","Mucitis"]}}
