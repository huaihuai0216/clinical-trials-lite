The total score and sub-scores were calculated using the following formula: ((X -Y) / 4Y) x 100, X=sum of the scores for individual items (between 1 and 5 for each item), Y=number of individual items included in above sum (i.e. 22 for the total score, 8 for the physical sub-score, 14 for the psychological sub-score, 7 for the sub-score 'appearance' and 'personal relations'). The scoring of the questionnaire was performed as specified by the instrument developers. Total scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better quality of life. If more than 25% of items are not completed, results were considered invalid.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.2","spread":"16.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.9","spread":"19.09"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.8","spread":"10.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.6","spread":"13.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.8","spread":"16.83"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.3","spread":"10.70"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.2","spread":"15.78"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.5","spread":"18.21"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.2","spread":"10.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.1","spread":"14.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.7","spread":"18.69"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.2","spread":"11.01"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.8","spread":"13.65"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.2","spread":"18.89"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.4","spread":"12.12"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.7","spread":"14.93"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.5","spread":"19.30"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.7","spread":"15.17"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.6","spread":"15.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.6","spread":"18.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.4","spread":"10.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.3","spread":"14.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.9","spread":"16.91"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.9","spread":"11.13"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.6","spread":"15.83"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.5","spread":"18.36"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.1","spread":"10.35"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.8","spread":"16.46"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0","spread":"17.95"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.0","spread":"10.97"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.5","spread":"18.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.4","spread":"16.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.5","spread":"11.82"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.6","spread":"18.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.8","spread":"16.65"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.5","spread":"12.95"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.0","spread":"19.10"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.1","spread":"15.70"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.5","spread":"13.36"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.8","spread":"17.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.7","spread":"17.52"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.1","spread":"12.13"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.8","spread":"15.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.8","spread":"16.83"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.6","spread":"12.45"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.1","spread":"16.94"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.0","spread":"18.58"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.8","spread":"13.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.2","spread":"13.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.2","spread":"17.31"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.5","spread":"12.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.8","spread":"21.99"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.8","spread":"17.12"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.3","spread":"16.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.1","spread":"17.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.2","spread":"16.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.0","spread":"15.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.5","spread":"20.06"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.3","spread":"11.05"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.0","spread":"18.65"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.1","spread":"25.91"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.0","spread":"7.07"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.3","spread":"14.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.6","spread":"16.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.9","spread":"4.30"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-10.6","spread":"7.57"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Summary of Pasireotide Trough Concentrations in Acromegaly Patients Following Monthly i.m.
