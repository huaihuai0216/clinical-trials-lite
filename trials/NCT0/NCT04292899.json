Death; 2. Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 3. Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4. Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen; 5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 6. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer required ongoing medical care (other than per protocol remdesivir administration); 7. Not hospitalized.
