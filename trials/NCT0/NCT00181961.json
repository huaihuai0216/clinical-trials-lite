We propose to carry out a dose-finding pilot study to determine the minimum effective dose of Maca Root. We hypothesize that patients who receive Maca Root will experience alleviation of their sexual dysfunction, and this effect will be more pronounced in those who receive higher doses of maca root.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Dysfunction Inventory Scores","timeFrame":"baseline to endpoint (8 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Maca Root 1500mg","deltaMin":0.249,"sd":2.39},{"arm":"Maca Root 3000mg","deltaMin":0.017,"sd":1.15}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".016"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":7},"commonTop":["GI Upset","Headache","Irritability","Urinary Frequency","Sleep issues"]}}
