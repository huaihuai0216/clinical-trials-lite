Neovascular AMD is an eye disease that causes blurred vision or a blind spot due to abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid or blood into the light sensitive lining inside the eye (retina). The fluid buildup causes the central part of the retina (macula) responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision to swell and thicken (edema), which distorts vision.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in BCVA Measured by the ETDRS Letter Score at Week 48","timeFrame":"At baseline and Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aflibercept 2q8","deltaMin":7.03,"sd":0.74},{"arm":"Aflibercept HDq12","deltaMin":6.06,"sd":0.77},{"arm":"Aflibercept HDq16","deltaMin":5.89,"sd":0.72}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0009"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0011"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":235,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Czechia","Estonia","France","Georgia","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Lithuania","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38461841"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":69,"n":336},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Cataract","Nasopharyngitis","Hypertension","Visual acuity reduced"]}}
