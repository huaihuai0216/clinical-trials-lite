For those children on insulin, investigators will confirm that attempts at removing insulin from the subject's therapeutic regimen had been previously made but had not been successful.\n* Age and Reproductive Status\n* Male and female patients eligible if 10 years of age, up to but not including 18 years of age at the time of enrollment/screening. At least 30% of total subjects will be between the ages of 10 and 14 years and at least one third, but no more than two thirds, female subjects.\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.\n* Women must not be breastfeeding.\n* Women of childbearing potential must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of treatment with study drugs: saxagliptin, and dapagliflozin, plus 5 half-lives of study drugs or 30 days (whichever is longer), plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for a total of 60 days post treatment completion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Target Disease Exceptions\n* Presence of Type 1 diabetes, as demonstrated by Preexisting diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes,\n* Previous diagnosis of monogenic etiology of Type 2 diabetes\n* Diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) within 6 months of screening\n* Current use of the following medications for the treatment of diabetes, or use within the specified timeframe prior to screening for the main study:\n* Eight weeks: sulfonylureas, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, metiglinide, oral or injectable incretins or incretin mimetics, other antidiabetes medications not otherwise specified.\n* Sixteen weeks: thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors (with no reported medication related AEs related to DPP-4 inhibitors), sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (with no reported medication related AEs related to SGLT-2 inhibitors)\n* Initiation or discontinuation of prescription or non-prescription weight loss drugs within 8 weeks of screening.

(Note: under certain specific circumstances a person who has been imprisoned may be included or permitted to continue as a subject. Strict conditions apply and Sponsor/designee approval is required.)\n* Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness.\n* Psychiatric or cognitive disorder that will, in the opinion of investigators, limit the subject's ability to comply with the study medications and monitoring.\n* Subjects who have contraindications to therapy as outlined in the saxagliptin and dapagliflozin Investigator Brochure or local package inserts.\n* Participation and receiving IP in another clinical study during the prior 3 months","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"10 Years","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Dapagliflozin Versus Placebo: Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in HbA1c at Week 26","description":"Data was analysed with an ANCOVA model with treatment, sex, age group and background antidiabetes medication as factors and Baseline HbA1c as covariate.
