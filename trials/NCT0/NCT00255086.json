In secondary analyses, we will determine if measures of clinical stabilization produced by memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) parallels stabilization of MRS measures of brain NAA and MRI volumetric measures of hippocampal volume.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"NAA/Cr Ratio","timeFrame":"Baseline; Year 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Memantine","deltaMin":1.47,"sd":0.11},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":1.38,"sd":0.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":9},"commonTop":["Study medication non compliance","Irritability","Tattoo eyeliner","Lethargy"]}}
