Criteria:\n\n* Have used insulin therapy (outside of pregnancy) any time in the past 2 years, except for short-term treatment of acute conditions, and up to a maximum of 4 weeks.\n* Have taken any glucose-lowering medications not included in Inclusion Criterion #3; (for example, acarbose, miglitol, pramlintide, exenatide, repaglinide, or nateglinide) in the past 3 months before Visit 1.\n* Have
