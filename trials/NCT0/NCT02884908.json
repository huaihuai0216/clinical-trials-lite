The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in participants with alcohol use disorder and co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder who have selected genotypes at the gamma-amino butyric acid transporter and receptor genes. The investigators will utilize a sample of African-Americans that includes both genders and individuals with different types of trauma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Heavy Drinking Days as Measured by the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB)","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pregabalin + BBCET","deltaMin":10.5,"sd":13.1},{"arm":"Placebo + BBCET","deltaMin":10.2,"sd":11.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.80"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24713617","25406046","22210072","23132700","18072813","22725618","23782139","19346279","26088121","22568872","20070788","19060720","26587796","18794673","40483726","38113919","34291990"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":26},"commonTop":["Reports of medical or psychiatric issues","Reports of medical or psychiatric issues","Reports of medical or psychiatric issues","Reports of medical or psychiatric issues","Reports of medical or psychiatric issues"]}}
