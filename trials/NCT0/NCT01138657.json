Only one TB test is required to allow the subject in the study. Subjects with either negative purified protein derivative (PPD) (\\< 5 mm of induration) or negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) equivalent) are eligible. Subjects with a repeat indeterminate QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) result are not eligible. Note, that only one TB screening test is allowed and required. A repeat QuantiFERON® TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) is not permitted if the PPD skin test is positive. The TB screening tests are diagnostic tests. In the event of a negative TB screening test, the results are to be interpreted in the context of the patient's epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc. and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a patient has previous, active or latent tuberculosis or not. Under no circumstances can a patient with a positive PPD result or positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) enter the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject with isolated anterior uveitis.\n* Subject with prior inadequate response to high-dose oral corticosteroids\n* Subject with confirmed or suspected infectious uveitis, including but not limited to infectious uveitis due to TB, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type 1 (HTLV-1), Whipple's disease, Herpes Zoster virus (HZV), Lyme disease, toxoplasmosis and herpes simplex virus (HSV).\n* Subject with serpiginous choroidopathy.\n* Subject with corneal or lens opacity that precludes visualization of the fundus or that likely requires cataract surgery during the duration of the trial.\n* Subject with intraocular pressure of ≥ 25 mmHg and on ≥ 2 glaucoma medications or evidence of glaucomatous optic nerve injury.\n* Subject with Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) less than 20 letters (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) in at least one eye at the Baseline Visit.\n* Subject with intermediate uveitis or panuveitis that has signs of intermediate uveitis (e.g.presence or history of snowbanking or snowballs) and symptoms and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggestive of a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. All subjects with intermediate uveitis or panuveitis that have signs of intermediate uveitis (e.g., presence or history of snowbanking or snowballs) must have had a brain MRI within 90 days prior to the Baseline Visit.\n* Subject has previous exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy or any biologic therapy (except intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\] therapy) with a potential therapeutic impact on non-infectious uveitis.\n* If entering the study on 1 concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, dose has been increased within the last 28 days prior to Baseline visit or is not within the following allowable doses at the Baseline visit:\n\n  * Methotrexate (MTX) ≤ 25 mg per week\n  * Cyclosporine ≤ 4 mg/kg per day\n  * Mycophenolate mofetil ≤ 2 grams per day or an equivalent drug to mycophenolate mofetil (e.g. mycophenolic acid) at an equivalent dose approved by the Medical Monitor.\n  * Azathioprine ≤ 175 mg per day\n  * Tacrolimus (oral formulation) ≤ 8 mg per day\n* Subject has received Retisert® (glucocorticosteroids implant) within 3 years prior to the Baseline visit or that has had complications related to the device. Subject has had Retisert® (glucocorticosteroids implant) removed within 90 days prior to the Baseline visit or has had complications related to the removal of the device.\n* Subject has received intraocular or periocular corticosteroids within 30 days prior to Baseline visit.\n* Subject with proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or clinically significant macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy.\n* Subject with neovascular/wet age-related macular degeneration\n* Subject with abnormality of vitreo-retinal interface (i.e., vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membranes, etc.) with the potential for macular structural damage independent of the inflammatory process.\n* Subject with severe vitreous haze that precludes visualization of the fundus at the Baseline visit.\n* Subject has received Ozurdex® (dexamethasone implant) within 6 months prior to the Baseline visit.\n* Subject has received intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy within 45 days of the Baseline visit for Lucentis® (ranibizumab) or Avastin® (bevacizumab) or within 60 days of the Baseline visit for anti-VEGF Trap (aflibercept).\n* Subject has received intravitreal methotrexate within 90 days prior to the Baseline visit\n* Subject on systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor within 1 week prior to Screening visit.\n* Subject with macular edema as the only sign of uveitis.\n* Subject with a history of scleritis.\n* Subject with intolerance to high-dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent of oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day or 60 to 80 mg/day).\n* Subject on cyclophosphamide within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to Treatment Failure on or After Week 6","description":"Time to treatment failure was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods.
