Telemedicine has shown promise in patients with other chronic diseases; pilot testing in our patients with inflammatory bowel disease demonstrated that the technology was feasible and improved clinical outcomes.\n\nThe telemedicine system for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Tele-IBD) should improve outcomes for patients, improve access to care in areas with limited resources, and decrease health care costs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Harvey Bradshaw Index","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":3.6},{"arm":"Weekly Home Monitoring","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":3.4},{"arm":"Home Monitoring Every Other Week","deltaMin":4.2,"sd":3.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25812483"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":117},"commonTop":[]}}
