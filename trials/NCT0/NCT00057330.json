The study will enroll approximately 7550 healthy women. These women will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible study groups: herpes vaccine (experimental group) or hepatitis A vaccine (control group). Participants will receive their assigned vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months. Participants will have 9 scheduled study visits and additional unscheduled visits for an evaluation of herpes if it is suspected. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 20 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Newly Acquired Genital Herpes Disease, Caused by Either Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1 or HSV-2","timeFrame":"Between Months 2 and 20","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Herpes Simplex Virus Group","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Havrix Group","deltaMin":35,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":75,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35199165","24285844","22216840"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":171,"n":4488},"commonTop":["Pain","Upper respiratory tract infection","Fatigue","Headache","Malaise"]}}
