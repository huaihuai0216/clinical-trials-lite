Inhaled or topical steroids are allowed.)\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Recent history of chronic alcohol consumption (defined as more than 5 oz of ethanol \\[absolute alcohol\\] per day) and/or drug abuse.\n* History of sexually transmitted infection within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"30 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Newly Acquired Genital Herpes Disease, Caused by Either Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1 or HSV-2","description":"Genital herpes disease was defined as signs (swelling, papules, vesicles, ulcers, crusts, fissures, erythema, or vaginal discharge) and/or symptoms (pain, burning, itching, tingling, dysuria) which developed on the skin or mucosa of the anogenital region and/or buttocks and laboratory confirmation of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1 or 2 infection (either concomitant positive HSV culture or HSV seroconversion within 6 months after onset of signs and/or symptoms).
