Were assessed when the patient was in a stable hemodynamic rest state (as demonstrated by three consecutive Mean PAP and CO measurements within 10% of each other). PAP was assessed when the patient was breathing ambient air, every 2 minutes whilst breathing Nitric Oxide(NO) (1st and 2nd), 5 min after the end of NO administration, and 15 mins after the end of NO administration. SVR was calculated according to the equation: SVR = (Paorta - Pright atrium)/CO","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1674.4","spread":"761.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1764.8","spread":"481.9"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1778.2","spread":"709.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1769.7","spread":"457.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1807.3","spread":"615.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1664.7","spread":"472.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1609.2","spread":"593.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1666.6","spread":"488.6"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1976.3","spread":"877.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1748.4","spread":"499.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1427.2","spread":"446.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1667.9","spread":"357.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1344.2","spread":"474.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1579.3","spread":"386.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1367.9","spread":"601.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1592.5","spread":"389.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1419.7","spread":"566.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1503.9","spread":"305.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1431.7","spread":"524.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1629.3","spread":"355.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Blood Gas Measurement - PaO2 at Baseline and Study Completion","description":"The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess Blood Gas Measurements in pulmonary hypertension, including PaO2 levels at baseline and Study completion Week 24.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"63.36","spread":"14.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"63.75","spread":"12.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"72.49","spread":"14.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"70.13","spread":"16.72"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Blood Gas Measurement - PaCO2 at Baseline and Study Completion","description":"The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess Blood Gas Measurements in pulmonary hypertension, including PaCO2 levels at baseline and Study completion Week 24.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32.70","spread":"4.40"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.02","spread":"4.76"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.36","spread":"5.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.23","spread":"3.55"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Blood Gas Measurement - PvO2 at Baseline and Study Completion","description":"The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess Blood Gas Measurements in pulmonary hypertension, including PvO2 levels at baseline and Study completion Week 24.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.16","spread":"4.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34.70","spread":"4.75"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35.56","spread":"3.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32.65","spread":"4.18"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Blood Gas Measurement - Arterial Saturation at Baseline and Study Completion","description":"The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess Blood Gas Measurements in pulmonary hypertension, including Arterial Saturation levels at baseline and Study completion Week 24.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"87.99","spread":"9.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.81","spread":"4.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"92.89","spread":"4.50"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.78","spread":"3.36"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Blood Gas Measurement - Venous Saturation at Baseline and Study Completion","description":"The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess Blood Gas Measurements in pulmonary hypertension, including Venous Saturation levels at baseline and Study completion Week 24.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"57.96","spread":"10.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"60.84","spread":"6.61"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"65.11","spread":"6.91"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"57.00","spread":"9.18"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Blood Gas Measurement - pH at Baseline and Study Completion","description":"The right heart catheter assessment was performed to assess Blood Gas Measurements in pulmonary hypertension, including pH levels at baseline and Study completion Week 24.
