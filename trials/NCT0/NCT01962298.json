However, since the availability of sugammadex, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of this novel product on these muscles.\n\nOur hypothesis is that by applying a different strategy in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and their reversal agents we might see a different activity of the respiratory muscles.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Electric Activity of the Diaphragm (Microvolts)","timeFrame":"From the start of spontaneous breathing till extubation, limited to maximum ten minutes after the onset of spontaneous breathing","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Single Rocuronium Dose - Placebo","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Single Rocuronium Dose - Sugammadex","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Repeated Rocuronium Dose - Neostigmine","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Repeated Rocuronium Dose - Sugammadex","deltaMin":2.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Continuous Rocuronium Dose","deltaMin":4.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Belgium"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23011532","31629404"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
