Participants receiving opioid medications at the onset of diarrhea may be included if they are on a stable dose or if there is anticipation of a dose decrease or cessation of use.\n* Participant plans to take the probiotic Saccaromyces boulardii or plans to receive fecal transplantation therapy, or any other therapies that have been demonstrated to decrease CDI recurrence at any time after infusion (Day 1) and through completion of the 12-week study period.\n* Participant has received another investigational study agent within the past 30 days or is currently participating in or scheduled to participate in any other clinical study with an investigational agent during the 12-week study.\n* Participant is not expected to survive for 72 hours.\n* Participant has any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the safety or rights of the participant, would make it unlikely for the participant to complete the study, or would confound the results of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With CDI Recurrence","description":"CDI recurrence is defined as the development of a new episode of diarrhea (3 or more loose stools in 24 or fewer hours) and a positive lab stool test (local or central) for toxigenic C. difficile after clinical cure of the initial CDI episode.
