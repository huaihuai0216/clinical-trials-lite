This suggests that agents with known anti-inflammatory properties, such as salicylates, may prevent the development of DN and the pain associated with DN. This study builds upon and expands on prior work done by the investigators with salsalate, a pro-drug form of salicylate, as an agent to address inflammatory pathways in people with T1DM.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Skin Biopsy - Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density (IENFD) - Distal Thigh","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Salsalate","deltaMin":12,"sd":57},{"arm":"Comparator","deltaMin":14,"sd":55}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39727210"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":37},"commonTop":["Infection","Gastrointestinal adverse event","Musculoskeletal adverse event","Endocrine, Endocrine/Infectious, Endocrine/Gastrointestinal","Otorhinolaryngologic adverse event"]}}
