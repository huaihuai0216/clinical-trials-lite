The secondary objectives are: to characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at the 15K baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment; to characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at 1000 IU/vial and 6000 IU/vial strengths; and to evaluate the safety of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUCinf) as Measured by One-stage Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) Clotting Assay for Pharmacokinetic Assessment 1 (PK1) and Pharmacokinetic Assessment 2 (PK2)","timeFrame":"Pre-dose and post dose at: 0.5 hour (hr), 1 hr, 6 hr, 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and 96 hr","effectByArm":[{"arm":"2K rFVIIIFc (1000 IU/Vial Strength) (PK1)","deltaMin":2255.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"15K rFVIIIFc (1000 and 6000 IU/Vial Strength Combined) (PK2)","deltaMin":2425.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Australia","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
