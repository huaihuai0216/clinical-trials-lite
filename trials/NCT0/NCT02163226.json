Pain response was defined by international consensus criteria as a combination of pain score and analgesic use (daily morphine-equivalent dose). Pain failure (ie, lack of response) was defined as worsening pain score (2 points on a 0-to-10 scale), an increase in morphine-equivalent opioid dose of 50% or more, reirradiation, or pathologic fracture. Time to failure was defined as the first occurrence of any of the following events: worsening in pain score by at least 2 categories by MDASI survey. Statistical tests in treatment group were based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare changes in pain scores and analgesic use at each assessment point relative to baseline. Increases or decreases of 2 or more points on a scale of 0 to 10 indicated improving or worsening pain. Fisher exact tests were used to compare the distribution of pain responders (CR + PR) and nonresponders (PP + IR).","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Evaluable Participants With Pain Response by Treatment","description":"Evaluate single fraction stereotactic regimen for pain response in terms of time to failure.
