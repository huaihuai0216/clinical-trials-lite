It is not known whether treatment with SOF/VEL can be shortened.\n\nThis study aims to find out if treatment for 6 weeks with open-label SOF/VEL is equivalent to treatment for 12 weeks with SOF/VEL in participants with recently acquired hepatitis C infection. The project is a randomised study where both participants and investigators would not find out the treatment duration of the participants until week 6 of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Undetectable HCV RNA at 12 Weeks Post End of Treatment (SVR12) Following SOF/VEL for 6 Weeks as Compared With 12 Weeks in People With Recent HCV Infection- Among Intention-to-treat (ITT) Population","timeFrame":"12 weeks post treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Drug: SOF/VEL for 6 Weeks","deltaMin":76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Drug: SOF/VEL for 12 Weeks","deltaMin":86,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Germany","Netherlands","New Zealand","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37675828","34023350"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":93},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Nausea","Diarrhoea"]}}
