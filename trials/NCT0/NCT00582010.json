The purpose of the study is to test if inhaled nitric oxide prevents liver injury associated with the restoration of blood flow. The premise of the current study is provided by previous studies which document a protective effect of inhaled nitric oxide in this clinical setting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changed Rate of Liver Function Recovery Post-transplantation (Percent Change in AST Levels)","timeFrame":"baseline and 96 hours after baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Inhaled Nitric Oxide","deltaMin":83,"sd":14.6},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":86.4,"sd":18}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17717604","24533048"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}
