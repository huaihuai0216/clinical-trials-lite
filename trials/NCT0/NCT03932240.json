Samples were centrifuged to yield platelet poor plasma (PPP), stored at -80 degrees Celsius and utilized for the clot analysis. Clot degradation was determined by degradation kinetic study. Blood samples were collected at four time points:1) baseline sample within 24 hours of surgery and after induction of anesthesia prior to CPB; 2) after termination of CPB and transfusion of platelets and either cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen (within 1 hour of separation from bypass; 3) upon arrival to the ICU; 4) 24 hours post-operatively. The primary outcome is to examine differences in clot degradation between study arms at 24 hours post-surgery.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.88","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.78","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.46","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.55","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.92","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.76","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Clot Strength","description":"Blood samples will be obtained from an arterial line that is required for the planned surgical procedure.
