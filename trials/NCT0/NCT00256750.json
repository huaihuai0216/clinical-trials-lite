Scoring is standardized using the norm-based scoring method where data is scored in relation to the U.S. general population having a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores below 50 are below the U.S. general population norm and above 50 are above the U.S. general population norm.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.9","spread":"0.712"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.5","spread":"0.691"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.6","spread":"0.712"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.7","spread":"0.631"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.1","spread":"0.612"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.3","spread":"0.630"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.7","spread":"0.716"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.2","spread":"0.698"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.1","spread":"0.712"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.7","spread":"0.610"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.3","spread":"0.592"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.6","spread":"0.610"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.7","spread":"0.767"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.8","spread":"0.744"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.9","spread":"0.772"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.4","spread":"0.718"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.4","spread":"0.694"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.6","spread":"0.720"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.0","spread":"0.724"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.8","spread":"0.702"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.9","spread":"0.722"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.5","spread":"0.668"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.0","spread":"0.651"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.9","spread":"0.665"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.1","spread":"0.665"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.8","spread":"0.647"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.5","spread":"0.664"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.0","spread":"0.638"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.7","spread":"0.619"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.6","spread":"0.636"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.4","spread":"0.685"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.0","spread":"0.670"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.0","spread":"0.684"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.7","spread":"0.640"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.2","spread":"0.621"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.8","spread":"0.641"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.7","spread":"0.765"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.6","spread":"0.741"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.9","spread":"0.768"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.3","spread":"0.716"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.3","spread":"0.695"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10.4","spread":"0.720"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.4","spread":"0.669"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.7","spread":"0.650"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8.0","spread":"0.667"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.0","spread":"0.651"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.2","spread":"0.636"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.7","spread":"0.649"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.2","spread":"0.722"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.3","spread":"0.696"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.1","spread":"0.713"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.1","spread":"0.641"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.2","spread":"0.619"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.8","spread":"0.635"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.2","spread":"0.710"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.6","spread":"0.692"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.0","spread":"0.706"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.685"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.7","spread":"0.662"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.5","spread":"0.679"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.7","spread":"0.793"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.0","spread":"0.766"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.9","spread":"0.785"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.4","spread":"0.740"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.4","spread":"0.715"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10.7","spread":"0.737"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.9","spread":"0.722"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.4","spread":"0.697"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.3","spread":"0.715"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.2","spread":"0.700"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.9","spread":"0.682"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8.0","spread":"0.695"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":"0.739"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.2","spread":"0.710"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.0","spread":"0.730"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.681"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.6","spread":"0.657"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.8","spread":"0.674"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8",
