This phase 3b study is designed to evaluate the safety and to explore the efficacy of an edoxaban-based antithrombotic regimen versus a VKA-based antithrombotic regimen in subjects with AF following catheter ablation. Bleeding is a central safety outcome in cardiovascular clinical trials, especially for antithrombotic strategies and invasive procedures.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Experienced the Composite of All-cause Death, Stroke (VARC-2), and Major Bleeding (ISTH) in the Edoxaban Group Compared With Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) Group in Participants Undergoing Catheter Ablation (Adjudicated Data)","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Day 90","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Edoxaban-based Regimen","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"VKA-based Regimen","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":75,"countries":["Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Poland","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24251359","27567465","19864188","19968920","25975659","24569891","23991658","19995881","33249467","29663464"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":40,"n":405},"commonTop":["Atrial fibrillation","Atrial flutter","Pyrexia","Palpitations","Dyspnea"]}}
