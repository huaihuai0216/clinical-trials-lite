This non-inferiority study focused on the primary objective of demonstrating that BT524 is non-inferior that means not worse than the comparator fresh frozen plasma/cryoprecipitate in reducing intraoperative blood loss when administered intravenously in subjects with acquired hypofibrinogenemia undergoing elective major spinal or abdominal surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Intra-operative Blood Loss","timeFrame":"From decision to treat the subject with IMP until end of surgery, an average of 5 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BT524","deltaMin":1380.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)/Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)","deltaMin":1660.13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["Belgium","Czechia","Germany","Poland","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40741224"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":28,"n":110},"commonTop":["Hallucination","Hypotension","Tachycardia","Hypertransaminasaemia","Anaemia postoperative"]}}
