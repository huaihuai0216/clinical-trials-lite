These data will be collected from the national registers and will be analyzed in combination with data collected for subjects enrolled in a large scale cluster-randomized study 111442.\n\nThe study will also assess the immune response to the GSK1024850A vaccine and the impact of the vaccine on occurrence of acute otitis media, carriage, safety in children starting vaccination below 18 months of age.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Person Year Rate as Regards Subjects With Culture-confirmed IPD Due to Any of the 10 Pneumococcal Vaccine Serotypes.
