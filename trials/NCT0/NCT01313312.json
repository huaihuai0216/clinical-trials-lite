The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3.
