For each participant, the difference between the morning and corresponding non-morning log WBC cystine value (non-morning minus morning) at each monthly visit during the Cystagon® phase (Months 1, 2, and 3) was computed and these differences were averaged. The average difference between morning and non-morning log WBC cystine value was similarly computed for each participant during the RP103 phase (Months 5, 6, and 7). The primary analysis compared within-subject pairs (Cystagon® phase paired with RP103 phase) of non-morning minus morning average differences of log WBC cystine level.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.229","spread":"0.5027"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.080","spread":"0.3939"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Discontinuations Due to AEs","description":"AE: any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug.
