(1-3 teeth may be treated. In case of adjacent teeth requiring grafting, only one tooth at each site will act as test or control tooth, but all teeth will get the same treatment).\n* Root coverage is not desired at the time of grafting.\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative urine pregnancy test.\n* Subjects must have read, understood and signed an institutional review board (IRB) approved Informed Consent Form.\n* Subjects must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject with class III recession in the presence of a shallow vestibule or class IV recession.\n* Subject with vestibule depth of less than 7mm from base of recession.\n* Subject with any systemic conditions that could compromise wound healing and preclude periodontal surgery (i.e., diabetes mellitus, cancer, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), bone metabolic diseases).\n* Subject who is currently receiving or has received within two months prior to study entry, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy which could compromise wound healing and preclude periodontal surgery.\n* Subject with the presence of acute infectious lesions in the areas intended for surgery.\n* Subject who has used any tobacco product within 3 months.\n* Subject who is taking intramuscular or intravenous bisphosphonates.\n* Subject with only molar teeth suitable for soft tissue grafting.\n* Subject with teeth that have Miller Grade 2 or higher mobility.\n* Subject with known hypersensitivity to bovine collagen and/or iodine (shellfish allergy).\n* Subject who has received an investigational drug or biological/bioactive treatment within 30 days prior to study enrollment (medical or dental).\n* Subject who was previously treated with Gintuit, Dermagraft or any other skin graft at the target site(s) or immediately adjacent teeth.\n* Subject, who in the opinion of the investigator, for any reason other than those listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects With at Least 2 mm Keratinized Tissue (KT) at 6 Months at the Gintuit Treated Site.","description":"The superiority of Gintuit relative to a pre-defined standard (50% success) for a 2 mm KT threshold after six months.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Color Same as Adjacent Tissues After 6 Months (Superiority)","description":"An examiner assessed color of both treated sites compared with the adjacent, non-treated tissue.
