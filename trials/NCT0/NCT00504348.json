High-resolution CT findings consistent with interstitial pneumonitis, confirmed by a radiologist. If consolidation is the only abnormal findings, the patient must have pathologically documented evidence of interstitial pneumonitis of other histological type than cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (the patient could have more than one histological type including cryptogenic organizing pneumonia/bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia)\n3. Meet two or more of the following criteria (must include 1) 1. Serum KL-6 above the upper normal limit 2. Presence of dyspnea on exertion (grade 2 on the Magnitude of Task component of the Mahler Modified Dyspnea Index 3. PaO2 of less than 80 mmHg while breathing ambient air at rest, not accompanied by abnormal increase of PaCO2 4.
