AD, also known as atopic eczema, is a chronic, relapsing skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin lesions which can affect any part of the body. Adult peoples who participate in this study will take either 100 mg or 200 mg of abrocitinib tablets by mouth for a duration of 12 weeks and adolescents will take for duration of 52 weeks. Knee Magnetic Resonance Imagine (MRI) will be done on adolescent peoples to determine bone safety findings. We will examine the experiences of people receiving the study medicines. This will help us determine if the study medicines are safe and how well they work.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs): Main Study","timeFrame":"From Day 1 of dosing up to 4 weeks post last dose (maximum up to Week 16)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Main Study: Abrocitinib 200 mg","deltaMin":30,"sd":null},{"arm":"Main Study: Abrocitinib 100 mg","deltaMin":26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=B7451094"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":99},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dermatitis atopic","Pyrexia","Gastrooesophageal reflux disease","Cough"]}}
