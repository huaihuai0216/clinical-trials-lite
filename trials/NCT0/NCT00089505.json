However, HIV infected women who have previously taken the single dose NNRTI nevirapine (SD NVP) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV may not respond as well to NNRTIs as women who have never taken NVP. Another class of anti-HIV drugs, protease inhibitors (PIs), may be more effective for women who have previously taken NNRTIs. This study will compare the effectiveness of NNRTI- and PI-based regimens in women who have taken NVP for prevention of MTCT of HIV. This study will also compare regimens including an NNRTI with regimens including a PI in women who have never taken NVP.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time From Randomization to Virologic Failure or Death for Participants Who Had SD NVP Exposure Prior to Study Entry","timeFrame":"Through database cutoff for DSMB review (by October 6, 2008) with median follow-up 72 weeks and range from 0 to 144 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NVP/NVP","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"NVP/LPV_r","deltaMin":60,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["Botswana","Kenya","Malawi","South Africa","Uganda","Zambia","Zimbabwe"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12152519","11600822","14562858","15247339","16877674","16736948","31487271","24938526","24443547","22719231","22509297","22301417","22123685","20942666"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":121},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Rash","Cough","Headache","Blood sodium decreased"]}}
