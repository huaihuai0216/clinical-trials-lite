Individuals on a tapering dose schedule of oral steroids lasting \\< 7 days and individuals (e.g., asthmatics) on a short schedule of oral steroids lasting 3 to 4 days may be included in the trial as long as they have not received more than one course within the last two weeks prior to enrollment. Topical steroids are not included in this exclusion criterion.\n* Anticipated to receive oral or injected antibiotic therapy within the 72 hours prior to the study blood draw. Topical antibiotics or antibiotic drops are not included in this exclusion criterion.\n* Suspected or known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the study vaccines or a vaccine containing the same substances. For ProQuad vaccine recipients, this includes a hypersensitivity to gelatin or a history of anaphylactic reactions to neomycin.\n* Thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder contraindicating intramuscular (IM) vaccination.\n* Parent or legal guardian unable or unwilling to comply with the study procedures.\n* Participation in another interventional clinical trial in the 30 days preceding enrollment, or participation in another clinical trial involving the investigation of a drug, vaccine, medical procedure, or medical device during the subject's trial period.\n* Diagnosed with any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would pose a health risk to the subject or interfere with the evaluation of the vaccine.\n* Received any vaccine in the 30-day period prior to receipt of study vaccine, or scheduled to receive any vaccination other than influenza vaccination and hyposensitization therapy in the 30-day period after receipt of any study vaccine. Hyposensitization therapy and influenza vaccination may be received up to two weeks before or two weeks after receiving the study vaccines. Subjects should not have received their 4th dose of Pneumococcal Conjugate (PCV) or Hib vaccine or their first dose of Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella (MMRV) vaccine before enrollment.\n* Personal or family history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).\n* History of seizures, including febrile seizures, or any other neurologic disorder.\n* Known hypersensitivity to dry natural rubber latex (pertinent
