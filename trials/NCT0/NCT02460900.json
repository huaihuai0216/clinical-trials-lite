The investigators will use a factorial design to evaluate the most promising behavioral and pharmacologic treatments aimed at achieving maximal efficacy for smoking cessation among people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke. Results of this study will provide crucial, real world evidence of the best way for healthcare providers to help smokers living with HIV/AIDS quit smoking.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With 7-day Point Prevalence Abstinence at 36 Weeks","timeFrame":"36 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Varenicline and Standard of Care","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo and Standard of Care","deltaMin":4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Positively Smoke Free and Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Positively Smoke Free and Varenicline","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":46},"commonTop":["Increased appetite","Nausea","Dry mouth","Rhinorrhea","Headache"]}}
