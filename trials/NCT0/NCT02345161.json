The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate improvements in lung function and health status for subjects treated with FF/UMEC/VI compared with budesonide/formoterol for 24 weeks. Once-daily 'closed' triple therapy of a Inhaled Corticosteroid/ Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists/ Long Acting Beta-Agonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) combination FF/UMEC/VI (100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) in a single device is being developed with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management of advanced (GOLD Group D) COPD which will reduce the exacerbation frequency, allow for a reduced burden of polypharmacy, convenience, and increase the potential for improvement in lung function, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established dual/monotherapies.\n\nSubjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have successfully completed all protocol procedures at the Screening Visit will enter the two-week run-in period. Following the run-in period, eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to one of the following double-blind treatment groups: FF/UMEC/VI 100 mcg/62.5 mcg/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA™ dry powder inhaler (DPI) once daily in the morning and placebo via reservoir inhaler twice daily OR Budesonide/formoterol 400 mcg/12 mcg via reservoir inhaler twice daily and placebo via the ELLIPTA DPI once daily in the morning.\n\nThe target enrollment is 1800 randomised subjects at approximately 200 study centers globally. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 27 weeks, consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 24-week treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period. Subjects will run-in on their existing COPD medications for 2 weeks and in addition will be provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol to be used on an as-needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study. Subjects will discontinue all existing COPD medications during the randomised treatment period but may continue their study supplied rescue albuterol/salbutamol. A sub-set of approximately 400 subjects will remain on blinded study treatment for up to a total of 52 weeks to provide additional long term safety data.\n\nELLIPTA and NUBULES are a trade marks of the GlaxoSmithKline Group of Companies.
