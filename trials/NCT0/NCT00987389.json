Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels: 1: no problems; 2: slight problems; 3: moderate problems; 4: severe problems; 5: Unable to do. The digits for each of 5 dimensions were combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state: e.g. state 11111 indicates no problem on any of the 5 dimensions. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death; negative values are valued as worse than death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.79","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.77","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":225,"n":352},"commonTop":[]}}}
