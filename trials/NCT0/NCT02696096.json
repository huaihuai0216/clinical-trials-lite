They represent the effect of the association between the brain activity of the seed region and each brain voxel over time during the resting state FMRI scan. A central z-value of 0 means that there is no association between the seed region and the voxel.\n\nPositive and negative z-values approaching 0 reflect increasingly weaker associations, and more extreme positive and negative values reflect stronger associations. Attributing the qualitative labels better or worse to these values depend upon the brain network and context. In many networks (eg, task-positive cognitive control network), a stronger positive correlation is thought to reflect better network organization. In the task-negative default mode network a stronger positive relationship is considered by some as worse. For this study, these are not yet used as clinical measures and there are not known cutoffs.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.315","spread":"0.057"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.328","spread":"0.076"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.384","spread":"0.098"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.394","spread":"0.139"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Working Memory - Between Groups at Baseline by Lapsed Category","description":"fMRI working memory differences between participants who lapse back to opioid use and those who don't","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.45","spread":"0.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.42","spread":"0.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.39","spread":"0.15"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":"0.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.34","spread":"0.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.33","spread":"0.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.36","spread":"0.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.32","spread":"0.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.46","spread":"0.20"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.49","spread":"0.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.36","spread":"0.16"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.33","spread":"0.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.39","spread":"0.22"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.36","spread":"0.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.38","spread":"0.20"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.37","spread":"0.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.42","spread":"0.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.39","spread":"0.26"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Changes in Working Memory - Within Groups During Satiation and Withdrawal","description":"fMRI working memory differences under satiation vs withdrawal from opioids","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.35","spread":"0.30"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.37","spread":"0.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.33","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.42","spread":"0.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.47","spread":"0.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.54","spread":"0.32"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.34","spread":"0.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.35","spread":"0.22"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}}
