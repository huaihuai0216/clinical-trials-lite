While stably using opiates (initial study appointment) and again during withdrawal (approximately 3 days later), participants will receive an FMRI scan with behavioral challenges; immediately after the second FMRI, they will receive their first dose of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine treatment will continue for twelve weeks, followed by a four week taper. Urine toxicological analysis will be performed prior to the first scanning session, weekly for two weeks and biweekly thereafter.\n\nParticipation for all individuals will last 4 months. Assessments will occur at baseline, and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Buprenorphine induction will begin at the completion of the second scan; follow-up medical visits will align with study assessments on weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All participants will receive 16 weeks of buprenorphine (the final 4 of these 16 weeks will include a taper).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes in Resting State Disorganization Between Baseline and One Week by Person by Lapsed Category","timeFrame":"Baseline and 1 week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"No Lapse","deltaMin":0.315,"sd":0.057},{"arm":"Lapse","deltaMin":0.328,"sd":0.076}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
