Chronic HCV genotype 1-infection prior to study enrollment. Chronic HCV-infection is defined as the following:\n\n   * Positive for anti-HCV antibody (Ab) or HCV RNA \\> 1,000 IU/mL at least 6 months before Screening, and positive for HCV RNA and anti-HCV Ab at the time of Screening; or\n   * HCV RNA \\> 1,000 IU/mL at the time of Screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV-infection (or a liver biopsy performed prior to enrollment with evidence of chronic hepatitis C disease).\n2. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV genotype 1b-infection.\n3. Compensated cirrhosis defined as a Child-Pugh Score of 5 or 6 at Screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n2. Positive test result for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody (confirmed by Western Blot).\n3. Any current or past clinical evidence of Child-Pugh B or C classification or clinical history of liver decompensation such as ascites (noted on physical exam), variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy.\n4. Confirmed presence of hepatocellular carcinoma indicated on imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to Screening or on an ultrasound performed at Screening (a positive ultrasound result will be confirmed with CT scan or MRI.)\n5. Use of contraindicated medications within 2 weeks of dosing\n6.
