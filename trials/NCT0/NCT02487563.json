Current treatments for thrombocytopenia after HSCT are frequently unsatisfactory in platelet recovery and for preventing potentially fatal bleeding complications. Therefore, it is urgent to explore an effective therapy to improve the outcomes of thrombocytopenia after HSCT. Previous studies have demonstrated that decitabine, a hypomethylating agent, may reduce platelet transfusions in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. The investigators conducted an prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficiency of rhTPO and decitabine in the treatment of thrombocytopenia following HSCT.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Platelet Count Recovery","timeFrame":"Up to 4 weeks after the treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Experimental Group 1","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Experimental Group 2","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["3881142","21713321","25566808","33646303"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":30},"commonTop":["Bleeding events","Hypohepatia","Fatigue","Fever","Chest distress"]}}
