Deposition of amyloid fibrils of variant TTR (primarily V30M) in peripheral nerve tissue produces the condition called FAP.\n\nThe prevention of the formation of amyloid by stabilization of the TTR native state should constitute an effective therapy for amyloid diseases. Therapeutic intervention with a TTR stabilizer drug, such as Fx-1006A, is hypothesized to stop progression of the disease in FAP patients. FAP is a uniformly fatal disease and Fx-1006A is intended to halt the relentless neurological deterioration FAP patients experience.\n\nThis Phase 2/3 study will enroll early to mid-stage FAP patients in order to interrupt and stabilize the disease at a point in time where progression of motor and autonomic dysfunction can be maximally effected. Male and female patients with FAP with documented V30M TTR mutation will receive Fx-1006A or placebo once daily for a period of eighteen (18) months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Response to Treatment as Measured by Neuropathy Impairment Score - Lower Limb (NIS-LL) at Month 18","timeFrame":"Month 18","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tafamidis","deltaMin":45.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":29.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","France","Germany","Portugal","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32107748","31353964","30558645","29115008","28393570","27494299"],"seeAlso":["http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3365.htm"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":65},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Urinary tract infection","Headache","Influenza","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
