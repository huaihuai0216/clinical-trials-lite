Both standard and fractional doses will be tested.\n\nParticipants are healthy adults aged 18 years or older, with no upper age limit. Procedures will be implemented to ensure participants of all ages (aged 18 and above) are included and that there is an even age distribution (\\<50 and ≥50 years) in each group. There will be a total of 6 groups (Sinopharm-standard dose Pfizer, Sinopharm-fractional dose Pfizer, AstraZeneca-standard dose Pfizer, AstraZeneca-fractional dose Pfizer, Sputnik - standard dose Pfizer, Sputnik - fractional dose Pfizer), with 200 participants per group for Sinopharm and 100 for AstraZeneca and Sputnik.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Seroresponse","timeFrame":"28-days post booster vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard","deltaMin":253,"sd":null},{"arm":"Fractional","deltaMin":250,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Mongolia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34863358","38357398"],"seeAlso":["https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01893-0","https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":65},"commonTop":["Headache","Hypertension","Acute respiratory tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Acute upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
