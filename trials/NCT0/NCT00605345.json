Patients currently receiving maintenance treatment with darbepoetin alfa will be randomized either to receive 4-weekly injections of Mircera with a starting dose (120, 200 or 360 micrograms subcutaneously) derived from the dose of darbepoetin alfa they were receiving in the 2 weeks preceding study start, or to stay on 2-weekly darbepoetin alfa therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Percentage of Participants Maintaining Average Haemoglobin (Hb) Concentration During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP) Within the Target Range","timeFrame":"Weeks 16-28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CERA Treatment Once Monthly","deltaMin":64.29,"sd":null},{"arm":"Darbepoetin Alfa Once Biweekly","deltaMin":57.14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.5947"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36791280","23325012"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":46},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Diarrhoea","Oedema Peripheral","Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
