A clot solubility assay was used to screen for FXIII deficiency. The assay is based on the ability of urea to dissolve fibrin clots that have not undergone FXIII-induced stabilization. Normal blood clots generally remain stable for 24 hours or more, while clots in which fibrin molecules have not been cross-linked are soluble within minutes. The outcome of the test is normal (FXIII present; a clot is observed in the test tube) or abnormal (FXIII absent or very low level; no clot in test tube).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Level of FXIII Activity One Hour After rFXIII Administration and 28 Days After rFXIII Administration for All Dosing Visits","description":"Subjects entered a 52-week treatment period of monthly (28Â±2 days) doses of 35 IU/kg rFXIII.
