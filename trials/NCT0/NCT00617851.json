In addition, this study is to show how safe and well tolerated a conventional inactivated subunit influenza vaccine, licensed in many countries outside the United States, is compared to an inactivated influenza vaccine, licensed in the United States.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs), by Vaccine Lots","timeFrame":"21 days after vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Influenza Virus Vaccine (Lot A)","deltaMin":566,"sd":null},{"arm":"Influenza Virus Vaccine (Lot B)","deltaMin":518,"sd":null},{"arm":"Influenza Virus Vaccine (Lot C)","deltaMin":513,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Dominican Republic"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":1209},"commonTop":[]}}
