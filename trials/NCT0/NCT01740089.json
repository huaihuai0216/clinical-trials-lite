Signed informed consent to participate in the study.\n2. Hepatitis С virus infection (genotypes 1а, 1b, 2, 3, 4) confirmed by a positive quantitative PCR (HCV RNA \\> 50 IU/ml).\n3. Males and females aged from 18 to 70 years inclusive.\n4. Body mass index of 18 - 30 kg/m inclusive.\n5. Increased ALT level (\\> 40, \\< 400 IU/L), documented at least twice within the last 6 months.\n6. Preserved protein synthetic liver function (i.e. INR \\< 1.7, albumin \\> 35 g/l).\n7. No signs of hepatic encephalopathy or abdominal fluid retention according to clinical and ultrasound examination.\n8. Fertile patients and their partners agree to use barrier contraception throughout the study and 7 months after its completion.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Intolerance of IFN alpha formulations, ribavirin or any components of these drugs according to the past medical history.\n2. Infection by hepatitis B virus or HIV.\n3. Past history of HCV treatment with IFN alfa or pegylated IFN alfa formulations.\n4. Administration of interferons and/or interferon inducing drugs for any indication within 1 month prior to the enrollment into the study.\n5. Cholestatic hepatitis (conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT levels of more than 5 ULN).\n6. Decompensated liver cirrhosis confirmed by laboratory findings (Child-Pugh class B, С) or ultrasound examination.\n7. Any documented autoimmune diseases.\n8. Hematologic (hemoglobin \\< 130 g/L for males and \\< 120 g/L for females; neutrophils \\< 1.5 х109/L; platelets \\< 90 х109/L) or biochemical abnormalities (creatinine level of more than 1.5 ULN, creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min).\n9. Documented diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle-cell anemia).\n10. Heavy depression, any other mental disorders, which in the Investigator's opinion can be contraindications for antiviral treatment.\n11. Epilepsy and/or other functional disorders of the central nervous system.\n12. Abnormal thyroid function (TTH level beyond the normal values).\n13. Malignant neoplasms.\n14. Pregnancy, lactation period.\n15. Severe comorbidities (for example, severe hypertension, severe coronary heart disease, decompensated diabetes mellitus), which in the Investigator's opinion can be contraindications for antiviral treatment.\n16. Documented rare hereditary diseases, such as intolerance of lactose, sucrose, fructose, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.\n17. Current alcohol or drug abuse, which in the Investigator's opinion can be contraindications for antiviral treatment or restrict treatment compliance.\n18. Simultaneous participation in other clinical trials or prior participation in this or another clinical trial within less than 30 days after its completion.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Randomized Patients Achieving Early Virologic Response (EVR) - Negative PCR Result for HCV RNA (< 15 IU/ml) or ≥ 2log10 Decrease of Viral Load After 12 Weeks of Study Treatment.","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"47","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"47","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Randomized Patients Achieving Rapid Virologic Response (RVR) - Negative PCR Result for HCV RNA (< 15 IU/ml) After 4 Weeks of Treatment.","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"33","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Randomized Patients Achieving Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) - Negative PCR Result for HCV RNA (< 15 IU/ml) 24 Weeks After Last Dose of Study Treatment.","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"75","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Patients Who Have Undetectable HCV RNA (< 15 IU/ml) at the End of Treatment.","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"88","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"38","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Immunogenicity","description":"Number of randomized patients with neutralizing antibodies to IFN alfa on weeks 0, 12, 24, 48 (for patients with genotype 1 or 4) and 24 weeks after last dose of study treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":101},"commonTop":["Flu-like syndrome","Grade 1 anemia","Asthenia (weakness, fatigue)","Headache","Grade 1 thrombocytopenia"]}}}
