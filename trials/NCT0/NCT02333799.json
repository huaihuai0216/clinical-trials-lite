Male or female, aged 14 years or above.\n4. Subjects with one of the following pulmonary TB conditions (WHO definitions prior to 2021):\n\n   a. Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) with\n\n   i. documented culture positive (for M.tb.) results within 3 months prior to screening or M.tb. confirmed in sputum based on molecular test within 3 months prior to or at screening;\n\n   ii. documented resistance to isoniazid, rifamycins, a fluoroquinolone and an injectable historically at any time or at screening;\n\n   b. Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) documented by culture positive results (for M.tb.) within 3 months prior to or at screening with documented non-response to treatment with the best available regimen for 6 months or more prior to enrolment who in the opinion of the Investigator have been adherent to treatment and will be adherent to study regimen;\n\n   c. MDR-TB documented by culture positive (for M.tb.) results within 3 months prior to or at screening who are unable to continue second line drug regimen due to a documented intolerance to:\n\n   i. PAS, ethionamide, aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones;\n\n   ii. Current treatment not listed above that renders subject eligible for the study in the Investigator's opinion.\n\n6\\.

Females who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening or already known to be pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to conceive a child during the study or within 6 months of cessation of treatment. Males planning to conceive a child during the study or within 6 months of cessation of treatment.\n9. A peripheral neuropathy of Grade 3 or 4, according to DMID (Appendix 2). Or, subjects with a Grade 1 or 2 neuropathy which is likely to progress/worsen over the course of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n10.
