Apremilast works by lowering some of the chemicals that affect psoriasis and therefore improves the symptoms of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to test apremilast and compare its effects to placebo (an inactive substance which contains no medicine but is in the same form as the drug). This study will test efficacy (improvement of signs and symptoms) and safety of apremilast in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 75% Improvement (Response) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI-75) at Week 16 From Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Apremilast","deltaMin":28.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":5.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":46,"countries":["United States","Austria","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Spain","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34255891","37316690"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":136},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Tension headache"]}}
