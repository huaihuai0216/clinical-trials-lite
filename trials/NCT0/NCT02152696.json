We will recruit hemodynamically stable women with a confirmed PPUL to be randomized to one of three strategies: 1) Uterine evacuation followed by methotrexate (MTX) for some (those that have evidence of a non visualized ectopic pregnancy) 2) Empiric treatment with MTX for all 3) Expectant management. Randomization will be 1:1:1 into these three arms. After randomization, they will be followed and treated clinically as is indicated by the progression of their condition. Primary outcome measures: uneventful decline of hCG to 5 IU/mL.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Uneventful Clinical Resolution of a Pregnancy of Unknown Location Without Change From the Initial Management Strategy","timeFrame":"6 weeks from randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Expectant Management","deltaMin":31,"sd":null},{"arm":"Uterine Evacuation With MTX for Some","deltaMin":42,"sd":null},{"arm":"Empiric Treatment With MTX for All","deltaMin":45,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34342619"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":86},"commonTop":["One or more adverse event","Vaginal bleeding","Pelvic Pain","Fatigue","Nausea"]}}
