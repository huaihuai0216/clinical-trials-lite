Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test at baseline and be willing to get an adequate method of contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients that are planned to be on dialysis or have a renal transplant in the following 6 months.\n* Transferrin iron Saturation \\< 20%.\n* Etiology of renal failure (as secondary to autoimmune diseases) that, to the judge to the physician, can affect the normal development of the protocol.\n* Active bleeding or history of hemorrhage that have led to a significative decrease of hematocrit in the last 30 days.\n* Non-controlled hypertension (≥160 mm Hg of systolic pressure and/or ≥100 mm Hg of diastolic pressure with anti-hypertensive treatment).\n* Anemia caused by any other cause than renal disease.\n* Having a transfusion in the last 3 months before basal visit or during screening.\n* Treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulant in the last 3 months before basal visit or screening.\n* Increase risk of thromboembolic disease: history of arterial thromboembolia (stroke, transient ischemic attack, Acute coronary syndrome, etc.) in the last 6 months or venous in the last 12 months before screening; surgery in the last month before screening; prolong immobilization or orthopedic surgery programmed in the following 6 months or any other condition that to the judge of the investigator can increase the risk of thromboembolism.\n* Hematological disease or myelodysplastic syndrome or history of hematological neoplasm or solid tumor in the last 5 years.\n* History of congestive heart failure\n* Pregnancy or breast feeding\n* Refuse to participate in the protocol or any medical condition, that in the investigator opinion, is significant to prevent the participant from being included in the trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85
