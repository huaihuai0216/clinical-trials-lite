An NIH clinical screening evaluation will be performed for those children who appear to have a history consistent with OI under protocol 04-CH-0077, Screening of and Diagnosis of Patients with Connective Tissue Disorder . Patients admitted for this screening visit who are less than four years of age as well as those older than 4 years of age but not meeting the criteria for inclusion in the growth hormone protocol, protocol 92-CH-0034, will be considered for enrollment in protocol 97-CH-0064 (Evaluation and Intervention for Ambulation, Growth and Basilar Invagination in OI), those older than four years who meet the criteria will be considered for co-enrollment in protocol 92-CH-0034.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for protocol 92-CH-0034 are as follows: patients must have a clinical/biochemical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta types III or IV, height less than third percentile for age, and radiological evidence that long bone epiphyses have not yet fused.\n\nPatients are excluded from protocol 92-CH-0034 if they have scoliosis of greater than 40 degrees unless scoliosis has been stable over the past two years, or evidence of severe basilar invagination.\n\nPatients with previous exposure to bisphosphonates in outside trials will be considered for participation in this trial.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nInability to comply with the visit schedule, maintenance of the physical therapy program, and ability to administer and comply with GH injections are central to our analysis of the outcomes of this study. Failure to comply with these conditions will constitute exclusion criteria.\n\nPregnancy.\n\nPatients that have had or will have surgery to place instrumentation in the spine (i.e. result of spine fusion).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"16 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bone Mineral Density in Response to Pamidronate","description":"Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) measurements were obtained using a Hologic QDR 4500 densitometer and low density software package.
