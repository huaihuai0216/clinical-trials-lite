For CD4+ cell count subgroup, Baseline CD4+ cell count group is included as a factor only.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"295.7","spread":"14.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"296.1","spread":"13.84"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"334.3","spread":"27.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"329.6","spread":"26.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"290.2","spread":"50.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"272.9","spread":"42.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"304.7","spread":"12.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"306.2","spread":"12.71"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"298.0","spread":"16.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"316.0","spread":"15.93"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"305.6","spread":"21.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"302.1","spread":"22.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"337.4","spread":"43.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"242.2","spread":"35.83"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"346.6","spread":"31.40"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"321.7","spread":"31.67"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"295.9","spread":"13.66"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"300.0","spread":"13.20"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"314.2","spread":"14.93"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"314.0","spread":"14.53"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"243.8","spread":"40.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"295.1","spread":"40.39"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"244.0","spread":"40.47"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"264.1","spread":"35.41"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"346.2","spread":"38.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"279.9","spread":"40.42"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in EuroQol - 5 Dimensions - 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) Utility Score at Weeks 4, 24, 48","description":"EQ-5D-5L questionnaire provides a profile of participant function and a global health state rating.
