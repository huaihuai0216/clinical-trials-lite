It is hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib will be superior to chemotherapy for progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR). It is also hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab + lenvatinib will be superior to chemotherapy for overall survival (OS).\n\nAs of Amendment 7 eligible participants on study completion will be able to transition to an extension study, if available, in which they can continue to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy, lenvatinib monotherapy, or a combination of both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib as received in the parent study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in Mismatch Repair Proficient (pMMR) Participants","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 44 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenvatinib + Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":9.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paclitaxel + Carboplatin","deltaMin":10.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.5550121"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":195,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39591551","34799418"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26245&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":228,"n":420},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Anaemia","Hypothyroidism"]}}
