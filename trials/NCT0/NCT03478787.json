Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON®-TB/purified protein derivative (PPD) test result may participate in the study if further work up (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then treatment must have been initiated and maintained according to local country guidelines.\n* Active systemic infection during the last 2 weeks prior to Baseline Visit (exception: common cold)\n* History of any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of any malignancy within the last 5 years except for successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n* Previous exposure to risankizumab\n* Previous exposure to secukinumab","healthyVolunteers":false,"minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With a 90% Reduction From Baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) at Week 16","description":"The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination.
