The OSDI questionnaire was administered at both visits and completed by the patient with no assistance from the office staff, physician, or anyone else. The baseline OSDI score was subtracted from the 90-day OSDI score and reported as change. A negative number represents a perceived improvement in ocular health.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11.3","spread":"0.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-11.4","spread":"1.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With Corneal Fluorescein Staining Score = 0","description":"The corneal surface was assessed by the investigator and graded on a scale of 0-3, where 0 = Absent (no staining present) and 3 = Severe (\\>50% coverage).
