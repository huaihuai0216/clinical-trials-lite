Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.68","spread":"0.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.70","spread":"0.21"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.66","spread":"0.24"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.69","spread":"0.23"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Time to First Greater Than 1 Day Sequential Decrease in Pain From Baseline for Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis","description":"Patient global assessment of arthritis: participants answered: \"Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?\" Participants responded by using a 0 - 100 mm VAS where 0 = very well and 100 = very poorly.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Time to First Greater Than 1 Day Sequential Decrease in Pain From Baseline for Patient Assessment of Arthritis Pain","description":"Participants rated the severity of arthritis pain on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no pain and 100 mm = most severe pain.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) Score at Baseline, Month 3 and 6","description":"WLQ: participant-reported 25-item scale to evaluate degree to which health problems interfere with an ability to perform job roles along 4 dimensions: time management scale (5-items); physical demands scale (6-item); mental-interpersonal demands Scale (9-items); output demands scale (5-items).
