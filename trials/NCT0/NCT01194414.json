Participants were randomized to receive either tocilizumab 162 mg sc weekly plus iv placebo every 4 weeks, or tocilizumab 8 mg/kg iv every 4 weeks plus sc placebo weekly during the double-blind period from baseline to Week 24. The double-blind period was followed by a 72-week open-label treatment with some switching of sc and iv administration. No placebo was administered in the open-label phase. Participants continued on their stable dose of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) throughout the study. Anticipated time on study treatment was 2 years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving an American College of Rheumatology Criteria (ACR20) Response at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline, 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab SC","deltaMin":69.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab IV","deltaMin":73.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":216,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Colombia","France","Germany","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Italy","Lithuania","Mexico","New Zealand","Peru","Philippines","Poland","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","Spain","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26056119"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":88,"n":631},"commonTop":["Alanine aminotransferase increased","Upper respiratory tract infection","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Nasopharyngitis","Urinary tract infection"]}}
