Lower scores indicate better stereoacuity and subjects who fail the first level (800 seconds of arc) are assigned a score of \\>800.\n\nWe administer a pretest, and those with a failed or uninterpretable score do not proceed with the Randot testing.\n\nThe Preschool Randot test consists of 3 booklets each with 2 sets of 4 random dot shapes (one is blank, 3 are actual figures), which can be matched to non-stereo shapes on the opposite side of the booklets. There are six levels (seconds of arc) in the test with two levels in each book. Each level has 4 rectangles that contain 3 shapes and one blank.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"39","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"47","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Distribution
