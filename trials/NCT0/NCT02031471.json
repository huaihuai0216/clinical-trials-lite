A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.57","spread":"1.92"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.57","spread":"1.36"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.41","spread":"1.83"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.62","spread":"2.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.33","spread":"2.59"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.15","spread":"2.46"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.69","spread":"2.80"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.89","spread":"5.91"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.07","spread":"2.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.66","spread":"1.56"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.74","spread":"2.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.50","spread":"2.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.36","spread":"1.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.18","spread":"1.41"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.56","spread":"1.61"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.46","spread":"2.37"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.17","spread":"2.46"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.92","spread":"2.53"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.65","spread":"2.87"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.75","spread":"NA"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Patient Fatigue VAS","description":"The Patient Fatigue VAS assessment represents the participant's assessment of his/her current level of fatigue on a 100 mm horizontal VAS.

The RA-WIS is scored by summing responses from all 23 scale items. The scale ranges from 0 to 23.
