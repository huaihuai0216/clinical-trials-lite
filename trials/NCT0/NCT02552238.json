Exclude the possibility of pregnancy: by testing on site at the institution (serum or urine βHCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of LUMASON administration(s), by surgical history (e.g., tubal ligation or hysterectomy), post menopausal with a minimum 1 year without menses;\n\n* Had any known hypersensitivity to 1 or more ingredients of LUMASON (sulfur hexafluoride or to any components of LUMASON);\n* Had any known hypersensitivity to dobutamine;\n* Had an ongoing or recent (within the last 30 days) acute myocardial infarction;\n* Had known right-to-left, bidirectional or transient cardiac shunt (ruled out with agitated saline study performed before administration of LUMASON);\n* Had electrolyte (especially potassium and magnesium) abnormalities;\n* Had unstable pulmonary and/or systemic hemodynamic conditions e.g.:\n\ndecompensated or inadequately controlled congestive heart failure (NYHA Class IV);\n\n* hypovolemia;\n* uncontrolled hypertension, i.e. resting systolic blood pressure \\>200 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>110 mmHg;\n* unstable angina;\n* acute coronary syndrome;\n* aortic dissection;\n* acute pericarditis,\n* myocarditis, or endocarditis;\n* stenosis of the main left coronary artery;\n* hemodynamically significant outflow obstruction of the left ventricle, including hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy;\n* hemodynamically significant cardiac valvular defect;\n* acute pulmonary embolism;\n* Had uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias;\n* Had significant disturbance in conduction;\n* Had hypertrophic subaortic stenosis;\n* Had an acute illness (e.g., infections, hyperthyroidism, or severe anemia);\n* Was previously entered into this study or received an investigational compound within 30 days before admission into this study;\n* Had been treated with any other contrast agent either intravascularly or orally within 48 hours of the first LUMASON administration;\n* Had any medical condition or other circumstances which would significantly decrease the chances of obtaining reliable data, achieving study objectives, or completing the study and/or postdose follow-up examinations;\n\nIn addition, due to the use of Atropine in subjects who had not reached targeted heart rate with peak dobutamine infusion, subjects with the following were excluded:\n\n* Glaucoma;\n* Pyloric stenosis;\n* Prostatic hypertrophy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Sensitivity and Specificity of Lumason Enhanced Dobutamine Stress Echo (DSE) for Detection or Exclusion of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)","description":"The diagnostic performance of the echocardiographic images was compared to the truth standard to determine sensitivity and specificity.
