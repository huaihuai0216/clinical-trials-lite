The participant should have received the metformin monotherapy for at least the 3 months prior to Screening; and must have a stable dose of greater than or equal to 1500 mg metformin for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization. Participants with a maximum tolerated dose that is documented to be less than 1500 mg of metformin may also be enrolled if this dose has been stable for 8 weeks prior to randomization.\n* No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than metformin within the 3 months prior to Screening. (Exception: if a participant has received other antidiabetic therapy for less than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)\n* Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2\n* Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng per mL. (If this screening criterion is not met, the participant still qualifies if C-peptide is greater than or equal to 1.5 ng per mL after a challenge test.\n* Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive\n* If regular use of other, non-excluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at least the 4 weeks prior to Screening. However, as needed use of prescription or over-the-counter medications is allowed at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure less than or equal to 110 mm Hg\n* Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g per dL for males and greater than or equal to 10 g per dL for females\n* Alanine aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 time the upper limit of normal\n* Serum creatinine less than1.5 mg per dL for males and less than 1.4 mg per dL for females\n* Thyroid-stimulating hormone level less than or equal to the upper limit of the normal range and the participant is clinically euthyroid.\n* Neither pregnant nor lactating.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must be practicing adequate contraception. Adequate contraception must be practiced for the duration of participation in the study.\n* Able and willing to monitor their own blood glucose concentrations with a home glucose monitor\n* No major illness or debility that in the investigator's opinion prohibits the participant from completing the study\n* Able and willing to provide written informed consent Exclusion Criteria\n* Urine albumin to creatinine ratio of greater than 1000 μg per mg at Screening. If elevated, the participant may be rescreened within 1 week.\n* History of cancer, other than squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, that has not been in full remission for at least 5 years prior to Screening. (A history of treated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II is allowed.)\n* History of laser treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy within the 6 months prior to Screening\n* History of treated diabetic gastric paresis\n* New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure regardless of therapy. Currently treated participants who are stable at Class I or II are candidates for the study.\n* History of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to Screening\n* History of any hemoglobinopathy that may affect determination of glycosylated hemoglobin\n* History of infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus\n* History of a psychiatric disorder that will affect the participant's ability to participate in the study\n* History of angioedema in association with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor inhibitors\n* History of alcohol or substance abuse within the 2 years prior to Screening\n* Receipt of any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to Screening or a history of receipt of an investigational antidiabetic drug within the 3 months prior to Screening\n* Prior treatment in an investigational study of alogliptin\n* Excluded Medications:\n\n  * Treatment with antidiabetic agents other than study drug or metformin is not allowed within the 3 months prior to Screening and through the completion of the end-of treatment/early termination procedures.\n  * Treatment with weight-loss drugs, any investigational antidiabetics, or oral or systemically injected glucocorticoids is not allowed from 3 months prior to randomization through the completion of the end-of-treatment/early termination procedures. Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n  * Participants must be instructed not to take any medications, including over-the-counter products, without first consulting with the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80
