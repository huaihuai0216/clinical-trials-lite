In the event that a pulmonary artery wedge pressure cannot be obtained during RHC, participants with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) \\<15 mm Hg, with normal left heart function, and absence of mitral stenosis on echocardiography can be eligible for enrollment\n* Have a World Health Organization (WHO) functional class value of II or III at the time of screening\n* All participants must be receiving an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) (such as bosentan or ambrisentan) and must be on a maintenance dose with no change in dose (other than weight-based adjustments) for at least 12 weeks prior to screening and have a screening aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) \\<3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* If on conventional PAH medication, including but not restricted to, anticoagulants, diuretics, digoxin, and oxygen therapy, the participant must be on stable doses with no changes (other than weight-based adjustments) for at least 4 weeks before screening\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy during screening. Furthermore, female participants must agree to abstain from sexual activity or to use two different reliable methods of birth control as determined by the Investigator during the study.
