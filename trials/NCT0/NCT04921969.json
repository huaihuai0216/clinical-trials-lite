This is a randomized, double-blind, Vehicle Controlled study. Participants will be randomized 2:2:1 to blinded treatment with ruxolitinib cream 0.75% ,1.5% , or vehicle cream, with stratification by baseline IGA score and age. At Week 8, efficacy will be evaluated. Participants who complete Week 8 assessments with no additional safety concerns will continue into the 44-week Long Term Safety (LTS) period with the same treatment regimen, except those initially randomized to vehicle cream will be rerandomized (1:1) in a blinded manner to 1 of the 2 active treatment groups (ruxolitinib cream 0.75% or 1.5%).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"VC Period: Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Investigator's Global Assessment - Treatment Success (IGA-TS) at Week 8","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"VC Period: Vehicle Cream BID","deltaMin":10.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"VC Period: Ruxolitinib 0.75% Cream BID","deltaMin":36.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"VC Period: Ruxolitinib 1.5% Cream BID","deltaMin":56.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":67,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":65},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","COVID-19","Pyrexia","Pharyngitis streptococcal"]}}
