Patient with surgical history should be excluded but patient with a pervious surgery more than 365 days before and apparently preserved maxillary sinus mucosa or patient with a previous surgery of nasal polypectomy more than 90 days before may be enrolled in the study.\n* Child with ABRS whose severity is classified as moderate or severe (total score \\>=4) based on the nasal cavity findings and symptoms.\n* Boy or girl aged \\>=3 months to \\<15 years.\n* Body weight \\>=6 kilograms (kg) to \\<40 kg.\n* Written informed consent has been obtained from the child's legally acceptable representative. If the child is 12 years or older, the child him/herself should have also provided written informed consent. The investigator (or sub-investigator) should attempt to obtain written informed consent from the child him/herself as far as possible even if the child is less than 12 years of age.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe infection that requires surgical treatment (e.g., child with systemic symptoms such as fever associated with swelling face, child with almost full nasal obstruction due to a large nasal polyp).\n* Serious complication such as acute mastoiditis, facial palsy, bacterial meningitis, and brain tumor.\n* Congenital disorder such as maxillofacial dysplasia.\n* Need of concomitant use of other antibiotics.\n* Serious underlying disease (e.g., cardiac disease, malignancy, juvenile diabetes).\n* Concurrent infection associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhoea, vomiting) that may affect safety assessment.\n* Known hypersensitivity to any component of CVA/AMPC or penicillin or cephem antibiotic, or past history of a serious adverse reaction possibly related to any of these agents.\n* Infectious mononucleosis.\n* Current hepatic impairment, or past history of jaundice or hepatic impairment due to any component of CVA/AMPC.\n* Past or current renal impairment (e.g., serum creatinine \\>=1.5 Ã— Upper Limit of Normal, creatinine clearance of less than 30 milliliter/liter \\[mL/L\\]).\n* Past or current immune dysfunction or insufficiency, or use of immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Need corticosteroid for systemic, eye drops or nasal drops.\n* Phenylketonuria.\n* Use of azithromycin within 14 days prior to the first dose of the investigational product.\n* Use of any antibiotic within 7 days prior to the first dose of the investigational product.\n* Current use or imperative use during the study period of probenecid or a tubular secretion inhibitor.\n* Participation in another clinical study within 3 months prior to enrollment, or prospected participation in another clinical study during the period of this study.\n* Girl with menstruation and childbearing potential, pregnant girl, lactating girl, or girl who is planning a pregnancy during the study period.
