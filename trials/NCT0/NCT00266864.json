Total body scans were performed and the energy level used for each total body scan was based on subject thickness (e. g., thin, standard, or thick). To analyze the results of each total body scan, proprietary software algorithms were used to segment the body into trunk, pelvis, and upper and lower extremities using the standard regions of interest. In accordance with International Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines, total body scans were repeated on 30 spinal cord injury subjects by the \"on-and-off -the-table\" method (i. e., subjects were repositioned between scans) and our precision error was equal to 1.2 % for LTM.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53.1","spread":"6.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"50.5","spread":"6.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Resting Energy Expenditure","description":"Resting Energy Expenditure was obtained by the measurement of exhaled air from fractions of mixed expired oxygen and carbon dioxide by a process known as indirect calorimetry.
