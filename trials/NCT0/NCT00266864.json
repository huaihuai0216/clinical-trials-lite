It is unclear whether the co-morbidity evident in this population are due directly to their immobility or are the result of unfavorable changes in their underlying hormonal milieu. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal males on:\n\nbody composition, i.e. lean tissue and fat mass, glucose tolerance, resting energy expenditure, autonomic-cardiovascular integrity, muscular strength, psychological assessment","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Assessment of Lean Tissue Mass (LTM)","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Testosterone Replacement Therapy","deltaMin":53.1,"sd":6.9},{"arm":"No Intervention","deltaMin":50.5,"sd":6.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21717386","21252493","23343764","24968251"],"seeAlso":["http://www.unitedspinal.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":18},"commonTop":["Skin irritation","Edema","Acne","Elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit","Liver function enzymes"]}}
