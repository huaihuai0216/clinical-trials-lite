This study will compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of mepolizumab administered as a liquid drug product in two different devices with the reconstituted lyophilized drug product in healthy subjects. Subjects will receive a single administration of 100 milligram (mg) mepolizumab as a single injection. The randomization will be stratified by body weight (\\<70 kilogram (kg), 70 \\<80 kg and \\>=80 kg) and the site of injection will be randomized 1:1:1 to the upper arm, abdomen or thigh. Approximately 243 healthy subjects will be randomized so that at least 9 subjects are randomized to each mepolizumab treatment within each weight strata and 3 subjects within each mepolizumab treatment, weight strata and injection site. Each subject will participate in the study for up to approximately 16 weeks (up to 85 days after drug administration), and will have a screening visit, a single dose treatment period, and a follow-up visit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Mepolizumab","timeFrame":"Day 1 (pre-dose, 2 hours, and 8 hours post-dose), Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57 and 85 post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lyophilized Vial","deltaMin":11.57,"sd":27.43},{"arm":"Liquid Autoinjector","deltaMin":11.98,"sd":24.96},{"arm":"Liquid Safety Syringe","deltaMin":12.07,"sd":27.29}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States","Germany","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31317668"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":85},"commonTop":["Headache","Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Fatigue"]}}
