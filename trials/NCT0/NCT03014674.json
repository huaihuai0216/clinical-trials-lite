Defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate.\n* Subjects who work for the Sponsor, contract research organization, or one of the study centers.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Mepolizumab","description":"Blood samples were collected at indicated time points.
