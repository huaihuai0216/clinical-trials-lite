The SKAMP-Combined score is obtained by summing 13 assessment items, where each item is rated on a 7-point scale (0 = normal to 6 = maximal impairment). This gives an overall (combined) SKAMP Score of 0= normal to 78 which indicates maximal impairment. The endpoint is assessed as a change from baseline in the overall score on the 78-point scale.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-9.1","spread":"7.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.6","spread":"7.85"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"PERMP (Permanent Product Measure of Performance).","description":"The PERMP is a math test that measures effortful performance without a learning curve (Wigal and Wigal 2006). The test determines the number of problems attempted and the number of problems correctly answered. In this study, the primary efficacy measure was a PERMP evaluation done 4 hours after taking study medication, a time selected a priori to coincide with the known pharmacodynamic effects based on prior research and to minimize the impact of repeated measures on adjustment of multiplicity (Wigal et al. 1998; Pelham et al. 2001). The PERMP consists of 400 math questions and each are scored. PERMP scores are expressed as the number of questions correct. Predose PERMP Tests are compared with post-dose PERMP scores at prespecfied timepoints.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.3","spread":"4.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-13.6","spread":"4.39"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":52},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain, upper","Epistaxis","Rhinitis, allergic"]}}}
