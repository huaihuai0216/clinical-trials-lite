Participants scored 4 symptoms (rhinorrhea, stuffiness, itching, sneezing) in their diaries using the following scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe. The Total Nasal Symptom Score was the sum of the 4 individual scores (range=0-12; higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms.) Change from baseline was the 15-day average score minus the baseline score. Scores were recorded twice daily, in the morning (AM) and night (PM). Average AM/PM scores were first calculated separately, then averaged together to obtain the 15-day average score. Baseline score was an average of the 3 AM scores and 3 PM scores preceding treatment. Negative changes indicated a decrease in symptom severity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.8","spread":"2.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.4","spread":"2.3"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.9","spread":"2.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Symptom Score at Day 4 (Physician Evaluation)","description":"Change from baseline at Day 4 was calculated for the Total Nasal Symptom Score, as assessed by the physician.
