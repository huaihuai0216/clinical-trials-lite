Treatment will continue through Week 144 (participants randomized to delayed treatment will change to bulevirtide 10 mg once daily SC after Week 48 through Week 144). All participants will be followed off-treatment for an additional 96 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Combined Response at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Delayed Treatment","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bulevirtide 2 mg/Day","deltaMin":44.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bulevirtide 10 mg/Day","deltaMin":48,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States","Germany","Italy","Russia","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35752223","37345876","38734383","39648559","39009085","38340811","37120031"],"seeAlso":["https://www.gileadclinicaltrials.com/study?nctid=NCT03852719"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":51},"commonTop":["Vitamin D deficiency","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Thrombocytopenia","Leukopenia","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
