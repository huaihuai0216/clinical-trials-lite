The change in Hb concentration between the baseline and evaluation periods was calculated by subtracting the baseline Hb from the evaluation period Hb. All blood samples for Hb measurements were taken prior to study drug administration.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.29","spread":"0.382"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.33","spread":"0.397"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.15","spread":"0.899"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.03","spread":"0.693"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Hemoglobin Concentration From Baseline Over Time","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.27","spread":"0.390"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.31","spread":"0.393"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.29","spread":"0.737"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.03","spread":"0.490"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.34","spread":"0.813"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.06","spread":"0.575"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.45","spread":"0.866"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.11","spread":"0.599"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.27","spread":"0.897"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.02","spread":"0.716"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.45","spread":"0.924"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.16","spread":"0.673"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.23","spread":"1.010"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.10","spread":"0.602"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.18","spread":"1.095"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.05","spread":"0.675"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.05","spread":"0.893"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.00","spread":"0.681"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.18","spread":"0.940"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.13","spread":"0.699"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.03","spread":"0.897"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.07","spread":"0.757"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.15","spread":"0.922"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.03","spread":"0.729"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.05","spread":"0.988"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.06","spread":"0.820"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.06","spread":"1.087"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.04","spread":"0.817"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.03","spread":"1.008"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.00","spread":"0.842"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.12","spread":"1.166"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.00","spread":"0.873"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.04","spread":"1.198"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.12","spread":"0.905"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.14","spread":"1.256"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.02","spread":"0.766"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.07","spread":"1.045"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.06","spread":"0.956"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusions","description":"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions could be given during the treatment period in case of medical need, i.e., in severely anemic patients with recognized symptoms or signs of anemia (e.g., in patients with acute blood loss, with severe angina, or whose Hemoglobin decreased to critical levels).
