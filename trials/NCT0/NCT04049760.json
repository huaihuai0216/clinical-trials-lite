Psychosocial, physical, and total scores were calculated based on the response to the questions within the patient reported outcome. The psychosocial score for the PedsQL encompassed 15 questions relating to the subjects' feelings, social interaction with others, and school. The physical score was derived from answers to 8 questions about the subjects' ease of managing physical activity. Total scores were the sum of all the item scores over the number of items answered on all the scales.
