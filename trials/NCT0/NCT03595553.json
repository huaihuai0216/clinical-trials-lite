A high fecal concentration of ridinilazole and little systemic exposure were noted.\n\nThe rationale for this phase 3 study is to confirm the improvement in sustained clinical response of CDI over vancomycin and to compare the safety and tolerability of ridinilazole to that of vancomycin.\n\nRidinilazole plasma concentration will be assessed in a subset of patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Sustained Clinical Response (SCR) Defined as Clinical Response and no Recurrence of CDI Through 30 Days Post End of Treatment (EOT).","timeFrame":"Day 40","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ridinilazole","deltaMin":238,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vancomycin","deltaMin":225,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":149,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Greece","Hungary","New Zealand","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38305378","30767587"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":32,"n":374},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Abdominal pain","Headache","Nausea","Anaemia"]}}
