items that measures fatigue related to MPN disease and the severity of nine of the most prevalent associated symptoms including: early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, concentration, night sweats, itching, bone pain, fever and weight loss. There were three recall periods used in this questionnaire, which were 24 hours for fatigue, the past week for symptoms of early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, concentration, night sweats, itching, bone pain and fever, and the past 6 months for weight loss, Each item was scored on a scale ranging from 0 (no fatigue/absent) to 10 (As bad as you can imagine/worst imaginable). The MPN-SAF TSS was computed as the average of the observed items multiplied by 10 to achieve a 0-to-100 scale.\n\nThe MPN-SAF TSS thus had a possible score range of 0 to 100.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.92","spread":"14.618"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.83","spread":"12.931"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-7.09","spread":"12.770"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22.66","spread":"14.319"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.26","spread":"13.896"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-6.40","spread":"14.101"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21.87","spread":"13.228"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.70","spread":"14.419"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-5.18","spread":"10.929"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22.14","spread":"13.994"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.76","spread":"16.880"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.38","spread":"14.438"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.00","spread":"13.007"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.35","spread":"12.357"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-2.65","spread":"13.753"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.41","spread":"13.148"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.47","spread":"11.441"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.94","spread":"13.840"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.57","spread":"14.233"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.36","spread":"9.443"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-6.21","spread":"12.135"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.92","spread":"14.494"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.33","spread":"8.026"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-7.58","spread":"11.237"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22.86","spread":"14.225"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.12","spread":"15.130"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.74","spread":"13.954"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":161},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Headache","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Fatigue"]}}}
