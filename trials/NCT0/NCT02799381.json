Part 1 contains 11 questions about the ON time dyskinesia and the impact of ON-dyskinesia on experiences of daily living. Part 2 contains 4 questions about OFF-dystonia rating. Part 3 contains 7 questions about objective evaluation of dyskinesia impairment and Part 4 contains 4 questions regarding dyskinesia disability. Each question is scored with respect to severity, which is rated on a scale where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3= moderate and 4 = severe. The UDysRS total score is obtained by summing the item scores, ranging from 0 to 104. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.33","spread":"2.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-17.37","spread":"2.79"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in ON Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia","description":"The Parkinson's Disease (PD) Symptom Diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected study visits.

Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness. The results are presented as a summary index.
