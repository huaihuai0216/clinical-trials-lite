Participants with body weight ≥30 kg (Cohort A) will be randomly assigned in a factorial design to (1) HCL plus intensive diabetes management or usual care with no HCL and (2) verapamil or placebo. Participants with body weight \\<30 kg (Cohort B) will be randomly assigned 2:1 in a parallel group design to HCL plus intensive diabetes management or to usual care with no HCL.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"C-peptide Area Under the Curve (AUC)","timeFrame":"52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HCL and Intensive Management","deltaMin":0.57,"sd":0.22},{"arm":"Non-HCL and Standard Care","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":0.18},{"arm":"Verapamil","deltaMin":0.66,"sd":0.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":0.22}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.89"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.04"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38860154","36826844","36826834"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":22},"commonTop":["Covid-19","Headache","Cold","Fever","Upper Respiratory Infection"]}}
