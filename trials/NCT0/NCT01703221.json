The primary hypotheses are that after 24 weeks: 1) Omarigliptin 25 mg weekly provides a greater reduction from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) compared with placebo, and 2) The mean change from baseline in HbA1c in participants treated with omarigliptin 25 mg weekly is non-inferior compared with that in participants treated with sitagliptin 50 mg daily.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline for Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Omarigliptin (Phase A)","deltaMin":-0.66,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sitagliptin (Phase A)","deltaMin":-0.65,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (Phase A)","deltaMin":0.13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.792"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28449368"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":166},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}
