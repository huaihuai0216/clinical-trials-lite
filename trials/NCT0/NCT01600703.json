The investigators therefore hypothesise that the drug sitagliptin which prevents the breakdown of GLP-1 will reduce intestinal lipoprotein production in humans. The investigators are unable to speculate whether sitagliptin will affect hepatic lipoprotein production because of lack of of data from animal studies or in vitro data. Sitagliptin is already an approved treatment for type 2 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Apolipoprotein B48 Production Rate After Acute Oral Administration of 100mg Sitagliptin (Compared to Placebo)","timeFrame":"10 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":122.9,"sd":30.4},{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":60.6,"sd":12.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24584549"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
