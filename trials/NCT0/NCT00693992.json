Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether sunitinib malate is effective in helping tumors continue to shrink or stop growing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Time from randomization to disease progression and death of any cause, whichever comes first (up to 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Sunitinib Malate)","deltaMin":4.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Placebo)","deltaMin":2.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":27,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":484,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28161554"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":97},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Diarrhea","Nausea","Anorexia","Hypertension"]}}
