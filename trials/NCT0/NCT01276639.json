lesions.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.31","spread":"0.99"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.23","spread":"1.01"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.38","spread":"0.99"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.26","spread":"0.90"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.87","spread":"0.64"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.88","spread":"0.64"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.83","spread":"0.54"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.92","spread":"0.54"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.85","spread":"0.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.91","spread":"0.73"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.79","spread":"0.85"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"3.08","spread":"0.56"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.21","spread":"0.60"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.19","spread":"0.62"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.14","spread":"0.58"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"3.27","spread":"0.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.08","spread":"0.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.96","spread":"1.01"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.14","spread":"0.97"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.02","spread":"0.90"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.69","spread":"0.71"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.65","spread":"0.67"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.71","spread":"0.58"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.68","spread":"0.59"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.60","spread":"0.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.63","spread":"0.77"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.53","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.71","spread":"0.78"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.91","spread":"0.69"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.90","spread":"0.66"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.83","spread":"0.69"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.98","spread":"0.69"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.32","spread":"1.05"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.23","spread":"1.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.33","spread":"1.10"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.24","spread":"1.07"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.75","spread":"0.78"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.71","spread":"0.75"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.55","spread":"0.59"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.76","spread":"0.70"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.60","spread":"0.86"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.60","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.36","spread":"0.82"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.77","spread":"0.86"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.98","spread":"0.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.91","spread":"0.72"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.77","spread":"0.72"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.97","spread":"0.78"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.84","spread":"1.05"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.72","spread":"1.05"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.14","spread":"0.99"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.17","spread":"0.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.40","spread":"0.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.26","spread":"0.86"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.64","spread":"0.62"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.83","spread":"0.68"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.39","spread":"0.92"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.28","spread":"0.89"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.58","spread":"0.88"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.91","spread":"0.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.75","spread":"0.81"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.60","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.98","spread":"0.64"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"3.14","spread":"0.69"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.70","spread":"1.05"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.48","spread":"1.03"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.94","spread":"0.99"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1.92","spread":"0.95"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.27","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.11","spread":"0.86"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.36","spread":"0.76"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.58","spread":"0.71"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.20","spread":"0.90"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.10","spread":"0.92"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.32","spread":"0.90"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.58","spread":"0.75"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.50","spread":"0.82"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.38","spread":"0.84"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.62","spread":"0.80"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.72","spread":"0.74"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.85","spread":"1.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.67","spread":"1.11"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.03","spread":"1
