The study will consist of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks followed by a 52-week treatment phase in which participants will be randomized in a ratio of 6:6:3:1:1:1 to receive GSK3196165 150 milligrams (mg) subcutaneous (SC) weekly, GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, tofacitinib capsules (cap) 5 mg twice a day or placebo (three arms, each placebo arm will have 12 weeks placebo followed by 40 weeks active treatment) respectively, all in combination with MTX. Participants who, in investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with GSK3196165, may be included in the long-term extension study \\[contRAst X (209564: NCT04333147)\\]. For those participants who do not continue into the long term-extension study, there will be an 8 week safety follow-up visit following the treatment phase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving 20 Percentage (%) Improvement in American College of Rheumatology Criteria (ACR20) at Week 12 Superiority Comparison With Placebo","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GSK3196165 90mg + MTX","deltaMin":54.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"GSK3196165 150mg + MTX","deltaMin":50.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tofacitinib 5mg + MTX","deltaMin":63.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pooled Placebo","deltaMin":42.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.0023"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0362"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0230"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0013"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":76,"countries":["China","Hungary","India","Italy","Malaysia","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37699654"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333147?term=209564&draw=2&rank=1"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":513},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Lymphopenia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
