It is hypothesized that V116 is noninferior to PCV20 for the common serotypes and superior to PCV20 for the unique serotypes as assessed by serotype specific opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) 30 days postvaccination. It is also hypothesized that V116 in participants 18 to 49 years of age immunobridges to V116 in participants 50 to 64 years of age as assessed by serotype specific OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs) 30 days postvaccination for all 21 serotypes in V116. Participants ≥50 years of age will be enrolled in Cohort 1, and participants 18 to 49 years of age will be enrolled in Cohort 2.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Solicited Injection-site Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"Up to 5 days post-vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cohort 1 V116","deltaMin":5.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 1 PCV20","deltaMin":6.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2 V116","deltaMin":15.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cohort 2 PCV20","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Chile","Germany","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","South Korea","Sweden","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38964361"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com","https://msd.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26092&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":1177},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Fatigue","Headache","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema"]}}
