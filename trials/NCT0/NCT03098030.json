Part 1 of the study involves intrasubject dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dinutuximab in combination with irinotecan. Part 2 of the study is designed to determine whether dinutuximab plus irinotecan prolongs overall survival (OS) compared with irinotecan alone. Subjects in Part 2 will be randomized in a 2:2:1 fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups: (A) irinotecan; (B) dinutuximab plus irinotecan; or (C) topotecan. Randomization will be stratified by duration of response to prior platinum therapy (relapse-free period \\<3 months or ≥3 months).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 2.5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 2: Dinutuximab + Irinotecan","deltaMin":6.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2: Irinotecan","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2: Topotecan","deltaMin":7.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":226,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bulgaria","Canada","France","Georgia","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Italy","Lithuania","Malaysia","Philippines","Poland","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35278766"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":12},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Anaemia","Neutropenia","Decreased appetite"]}}
