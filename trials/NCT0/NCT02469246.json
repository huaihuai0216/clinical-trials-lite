understand and sign a written informed consent form\n* On antiretroviral regimen containing ABC/3TC FDC in combination with one 3rd agent for ≥ 6 consecutive months prior to screening\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels \\< 50 copies/mL for ≥ 6 months preceding the screening visit (measured at least twice using the same assay) and without experiencing two consecutive HIV-1 RNA above detectable levels after achieving a confirmed (two consecutive) HIV-1 RNA below detectable levels on the current regimen in the past year\n* Plasma HIV-1 RNA should be \\< 50 copies/mL at the screening visit\n* Normal ECG\n* Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 50 mL/min according to the Cockcroft Gault formula for creatinine clearance\n* Hepatic transaminases (AST and ALT) ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin\n* Adequate hematologic function\n* Serum amylase ≤ 5 × ULN\n* Females of childbearing potential and males must agree to utilize highly effective contraception methods or be non-heterosexually active or practice sexual abstinence from screening throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening\n* Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive\n* Individuals experiencing decompensated cirrhosis\n* Individuals receiving ongoing treatment with bisphosphonate to treat bone disease (eg, osteoporosis)\n* Pregnant or lactating females\n* Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Current alcohol or substance use judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance\n* A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma.\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1 Visit\n* Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the individual unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with dosing requirements\n* Participation in any other clinical trial (including observational trials) without prior approval\n* Medications excluded due to the potential for interaction with emtricitabine (FTC), TAF, ABC or 3TC\n\nNote: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
