cancer treatment for the diagnosis that made the patient eligible for this study) with germ cell tumor, hepatoblastoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or other malignancy\n* Planning to receive a chemotherapy treatment regimen that includes a cumulative cisplatin dose ≥ 200 mg/m² with individual cisplatin doses to be infused over ≤ 6 hours\n* Enrolled on hearing assessment clinical trial COG-ACCL05C1\n\n  * Normal auditory results\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Karnofsky performance status (PS) 50-100% (for patients \\> 16 years of age)\n* Lansky PS 50-100% (for patients ≤ 16 years of age)\n* Serum sodium normal\n* Absolute granulocyte count \\> 1,000/mm³\n* Platelet count \\> 100,000/mm³\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate ≥ 70mL/min OR serum creatinine between 0.4 and 1.7 mg/dL, based on age and gender\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* AST or ALT \\< 2.5 times ULN for age\n* Not pregnant or nursing\n* Negative pregnancy test (if patient has child-bearing capacity)\n* Fertile patients must use effective contraception\n* No known hypersensitivity to sodium thiosulfate or other thiol agents (e.g., amifostine trihydrate, N-acetylcysteine, MESNA, or captopril)\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* No prior platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin)\n\n  * Other prior chemotherapy allowed\n* Prior cranial radiotherapy (e.g., for treatment of medulloblastoma) allowed provided normal hearing is documented after completion of radiotherapy and before enrollment and administration of cisplatin chemotherapy\n* At least 6 months since prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n\n  * No evidence of graft-versus-host disease\n* No concurrent enrollment on another COG clinical trial for treatment of the cancer.\n\n  * Concurrent enrollment on a non-COG clinical trial (e.g., Head start) allowed.\n* Cranial irradiation after the completion of all systemic chemotherapy allowed provided post end-of-treatment audiometry is completed prior to beginning irradiation.\n* Concurrent radiotherapy to extracranial sites allowed.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Year","maximumAge":"18
