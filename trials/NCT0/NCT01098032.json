All enrolled patients must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate \\<30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or a contrast nephropathy risk score â‰¥11). In all cases iodixanol (an iso-osmolar, non ionic contrast agent) will be administered. The primary end point is an increase of \\>=0.3 mg/dL in the creatinine concentration 48 hours after the procedure.\n\nThis study will give important answers on how to prevent CI-AKI in high and very-high risk patients undergoing contrast media exposure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Contrast-induced Acute Kidney Injury","timeFrame":"at 48 hours following contrast exposure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Systemic Alone Therapy Group","deltaMin":146,"sd":null},{"arm":"RenalGuard System Group","deltaMin":146,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16606801","11285590","9375704","16612402","15954892","10900277","9087670","10328471","15150204","15492300","17309916","14600187","18402894","18468994","9973020","7969280","15464318","11904577","14972420","26333343","21844075","21518686"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":146},"commonTop":["Hypokalemia","Micturation"]}}
