Studies will be performed in 10 subjects with COPD nonresponsive to bronchodilators. Subjects will receive theophylline tablets for 1 week, followed by measurement of circulating HDAC and the acute effect of oral prednisone on the bronchodilator response to inhaled beta agonist. Roflumilast tablets will be added to the theophylline for a further week and the studies repeated. The study will provide preliminary data on the effects of theophylline and roflumilast on circulating HDAC levels and the effects of corticosteroids on the beta agonist bronchodilator response in COPD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Bronchodilation","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 1 and 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Theophylline and Roflumilast","deltaMin":1.18,"sd":0.51}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":">0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":[]}}
