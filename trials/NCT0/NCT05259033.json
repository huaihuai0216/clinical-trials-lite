Which treatment participants get is decided by chance. IcoSema is a new medicine that doctors cannot prescribe. Doctors can already prescribe semaglutide in many countries.\n\nParticipants will get IcoSema or semaglutide, which they must inject once a week with a pen, which has a small needle, in a skin fold in the thigh, upper arm, or stomach.\n\nThe study will last for about 1 year and 1 month. Participants will have 18 clinic visits, 34 phone/video calls with the study doctor, and 4 contacts with the site that can either be clinic visits or phone/video calls.\n\nAt 11 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 7 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to get pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (week 0), (week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IcoSema","deltaMin":-1.4,"sd":0.91},{"arm":"Semaglutide","deltaMin":-0.86,"sd":0.96}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":136,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Canada","China","France","Greece","Hungary","Israel","Japan","Russia","Slovakia","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39820580"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":341},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
