Subjects with polyarticular course JIA (ie, extended oligoarthritis, polyarthritis RF+, polyarthritis RF , systemic JIA with active arthritis but without active systemic features) must have a minimum of 5 active joints (an active joint is defined as a joint with swelling or, in the absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness) at screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry.\n\n   Subjects with psoriatic or enthesitis related arthritis must have a minimum of 3 active joints (an active joint is defined as a joint with swelling or, in the absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or tenderness) at screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry.\n\n   Treatment with stable doses of a Non Steroidal Anti inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and/or a stable dose of an oral glucocorticoid, and/or a stable dose of methotrexate is permitted.\n\n   For subjects receiving an oral glucocorticoid: Glucocorticoids may be administered at a maximum dose of 0.2 mg of prednisone equivalent per kilogram per day or 10 mg per day for ≥ 2 weeks before baseline, whichever is lower.\n\n   For subjects receiving methotrexate (MTX) treatment: MTX may be administered either orally or parenterally at doses not to exceed 25 mg/wk or 20 mg/m2/week (whichever is lower); participants must have taken MTX for 3 months and be at a stable dose for at least 6 weeks before baseline. Subjects taking MTX must be taking folic acid or folinic acid in accordance with local standards.\n\n   For subjects with psoriatic arthritis, the following topical treatments for psoriasis are allowed: non medicated emollients for use over the whole body; topical steroids including hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetate ≤1% for the palms, soles, face, and intertriginous areas only; tar, salicylic acid preparations, and shampoos free of corticosteroids are permitted only for the scalp\n3.
