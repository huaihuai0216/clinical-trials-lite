The study will specifically evaluate the potential for immunogenicity (example \\[e.g.\\] incidences of anti-drug antibodies \\[ADA\\]) and injection site reactions (ISRs).\n\nAlbiglutide is a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) with a sufficiently long half-life to permit once a week injection. Currently, lyophilized albiglutide and the diluent are provided in a dual chamber cartridge (DCC), single-dose pen injector, requiring reconstitution prior to use. A liquid formulation of albiglutide will enable the commercialization of a liquid product in a single dose, ready-to-use prefilled syringe in an auto-injector.\n\nThe primary hypothesis of this study is to test that liquid drug product will provide glycemic control (as measured by HbA1c change from baseline) non-inferior to lyophilized drug product for a period of 26 weeks of treatment in subjects with T2DM.\n\nThis study will comprise of 3 study periods : screening (2 weeks), treatment (26 weeks) and for those subjects not entering the extension study a follow-up period (8 weeks). Approximately 300 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Albiglutide active liquid auto-injector (LAI) plus Placebo lyophilized DCC pen injector (lyophilized DCC PI); or, Albiglutide lyophilized DCC PI plus Placebo LAI.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Albiglutide Liquid","deltaMin":-1.12,"sd":0.072},{"arm":"Albiglutide Lyophilized","deltaMin":-1.18,"sd":0.072}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31004676"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":153},"commonTop":["Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Headache","Viral upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
