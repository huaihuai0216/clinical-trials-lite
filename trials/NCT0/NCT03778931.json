Subjects must be appropriate candidates for endocrine monotherapy\n3. Subjects must have measurable disease or bone only disease\n4. Female or male subjects age â‰¥ 18 years; female subjects must be postmenopausal women and male subjects must not allow pregnancy with their sperm (abstain, do not donate sperm, etc).\n5.

Subjects must have received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with either fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for advanced/metastatic breast cancer (mBC).\n8. Subjects may have received no more than one line of chemotherapy in the advanced/metastatic setting.\n\nCritical Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
