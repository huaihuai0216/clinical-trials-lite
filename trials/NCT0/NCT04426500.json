The study team expects to be able to equally efficiently administer the blocks using direct visualization and ultrasound guidance. The study team expects that a negative result would obviate the need for longer operative time by eliminating the need for the separate ultrasound guided block while a positive result would demonstrate the increased utility of preoperative ultrasound blocks in managing postoperative pain.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Visual Analog Scale (VAS)","timeFrame":"24 hours post operatively","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo/Local Anesthesia","deltaMin":1.29,"sd":1.98},{"arm":"Ultrasound-guided Transversus Abdominus Plane (UTAP) Block","deltaMin":3.16,"sd":3.1},{"arm":"Robotic -Guided Transversus Abdominus Plane (RTAP) Block","deltaMin":2.89,"sd":2.69}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22902793","24860252","27733219","30056612"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":28},"commonTop":[]}}
