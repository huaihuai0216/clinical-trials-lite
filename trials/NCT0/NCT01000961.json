The current marketed therapy is Cystagon® (cysteamine bitartrate) which must be taken every six hours for the rest of the patient's life to prevent complications of cystinosis. RP103 is a formulation of cysteamine bitartrate that is being studied to see if it may be able to be given less frequently, once every 12 hours, and have similar results to four times a day Cystagon®.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Steady-state White Blood Cell Cystine Levels of RP103 Compared to Cystagon®","timeFrame":"4 weeks after the last subject has completed the study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"RP103","deltaMin":0.5152,"sd":0.05555},{"arm":"Cystagon®","deltaMin":0.4367,"sd":0.05555}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","France","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16769383","17229040","16252107"],"seeAlso":["http://www.procysbi.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":43},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Nausea","Abdominal Pain","Hypokalaemia"]}}
