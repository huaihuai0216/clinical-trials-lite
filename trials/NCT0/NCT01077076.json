Additional purposes are to:\n\n1. provide pharmacodynamic evidence comparing 24-hr inhibition of acid secretion on the 1st, 4th, and 11th days of dosing with each of the indicated treatments;\n2. compare Zegerid and Prilosec OTC for achieving their steady-state effects for controlling 24-hr gastric acidity at steady-state on the 4th and 11th day of dosing.\n3. evaluate early effectiveness, defined as effect on intragastric pH during the first 4 hours after administration, of Zegerid, Prilosec OTC Tablets, and placebo on acid inhibition at steady-state when administered on the 11th day of dosing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Time With Intragastric pH>4 During the First 4 Hours Following Administration on Day 4 of Treatment","timeFrame":"4 hours after dose on Day 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zegerid OTC Capsules","deltaMin":53.265,"sd":27.588},{"arm":"Prilosec OTC Tablets","deltaMin":46.933,"sd":21.885},{"arm":"Placebo Capsules","deltaMin":17.215,"sd":15.432}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
