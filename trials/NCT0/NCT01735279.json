The Central Nervous System (CNS) is consisted by a large amount of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAS) from omega-3 serie. Omega-3 takes part in several actions, including the modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In its deficiency is detected a hypofunctioning of the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathway, related to the reward system, involved on the context of nicotine dependence. Treatment using dietary supplementation with omega-3 shows improvements in several diseases, including mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. The investigators hypothesis is that supplementation with these fatty acids can restore the levels of omega-3 and could decrease nicotine dependence. The investigators objective is to investigate a possible association between increased serum levels of omega-3 and the reduction in nicotine dependence.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Fageström Test for Nicotine Dependence Score at Baseline and After 90 Days of the Treatment","timeFrame":"Baseline (prior to the beginning) and after 90 days of the treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.53,"sd":2.01},{"arm":"Omega3","deltaMin":6.56,"sd":1.52}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Brazil"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":29},"commonTop":[]}}
