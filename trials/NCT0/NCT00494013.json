Have had more than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia, within 6 months prior to entry into the study, or is currently diagnosed as having hypoglycemia unawareness.\n4. Have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal dialysis or creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (177 micromoles per liter \\[micromol/L\\]).\n5.
