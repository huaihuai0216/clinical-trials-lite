The study will measure the amount of antibodies (the proteins that fight off germs) produced by children with Sickle Cell Disease after they have been given the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine between 6 and less than 18 years of age. They will be given the vaccination twice, each vaccination separated by approximately 6 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) in Serotype-Specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) From 1 Month After 13vPnC Dose 1 to 1 Month After 13vPnC Dose 2","timeFrame":"1 Month After 13vPnC Dose 1, 1 Month After 13vPnC Dose 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC","deltaMin":0.75,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States","Egypt","France","Italy","Lebanon","Saudi Arabia","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=6096A1-3014&StudyName=Study%20Evaluating%2013-valent%20Pneumococcal%20Conjugate%20Vaccine%20%2813vPnC%29%20in%20Children%20with%20Sickle%20Cell%20Disease"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":40,"n":158},"commonTop":["Pain (Any)","Pain (Mild)","Muscle pain (Any)","Fatigue (Any)","Muscle pain (Mild)"]}}
