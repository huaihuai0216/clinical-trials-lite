The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI) and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FSC) in subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening will complete a 7 to 14 day Run-in period. At the end of the run-in period, approximately 710 eligible subjects will be equally randomized (to complete at least 568 evaluable subjects) to one of the 2 treatment groups for 12 weeks: 1. UMEC/VI 62.5/25 micrograms (mcg) administered as one inhalation once-daily in the morning via the Novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) + placebo administered as one inhalation each morning and evening via single multidose powdered inhaler (ACCUHALER/DISKUS) or 2. FSC 500/50 mcg administered as one inhalation each morning and evening via ACCUHALER/DISKUS + placebo administered once-daily in the morning via NDPI. A safety Follow-up assessment will be conducted approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment (Early Withdrawal, if applicable). The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 15 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) in 0 to 24 Hour Weighted Mean Serial Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 84","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 84","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg","deltaMin":0.166,"sd":0.0122},{"arm":"FSC 500/50 µg","deltaMin":0.087,"sd":0.0121}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["Czechia","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26286141"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":358},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
