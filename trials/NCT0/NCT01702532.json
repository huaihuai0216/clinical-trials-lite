The purpose of this study is to investigate the craving relief efficacy of nicotine mouth film by comparing mint nicotine mouth film to nicotine lozenge in light smokers using the provoked craving model. The cues used to provoke a craving episode will be the sight and smell of a lit cigarette and the manipulations required to light a cigarette. The smokers will be denied access to cigarettes for 4 hours prior to the provoked craving session in order to precipitate nicotine withdrawal and an increase level of cigarette craving.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Change From Pre-dose Post-provocation in Craving Score at 50 Seconds","timeFrame":"Pre-dosing post-provocation to 50 seconds","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nicotine Mouth Film 2.5 mg","deltaMin":-14.15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nicotine Lozenge 2 mg","deltaMin":-9.26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0141"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":161},"commonTop":["Nausea","Throat Irritation","Hiccups","Epigastric Discomfort","Dizziness"]}}
