PAD will be defined as the following: 1) An ankle-brachial index (ABI) \\<=0.90 at the baseline study visit or 2) Vascular laboratory evidence or angiographic evidence of PAD. Inclusion based on prior vascular laboratory evidence will be determined by the study principal investigator and includes, for example, a toe brachial index (TBI) \\< 0.70, Duplex measure showing 70% stenosis or great, a post heel-rise or post-exercise ABI drop of 20% or greater, or ABI values \\<= 0.90. Angiographic evidence of PAD consists of a stenosis of 70% or greater in a lower extremity artery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Above- or below-knee amputation.\n2. Critical limb ischemia.\n3. Wheelchair-bound or requiring a walker to ambulate.\n4. Walking is limited by a symptom other than PAD.\n5. Current foot ulcer on bottom of foot.\n6. End stage renal disease defined as a GFR less than 20 ml/min/1.73 M2.\n7. Significant liver impairment defined as two or more hepatic function enzymes \\>3.0 times the upper limit of normal. \\[NOTE: participants who meet this criterion may undergo a re-test of hepatic function tests to determine whether initially elevated hepatic enzymes represented a transient or spurious phenomenon.\\]\n8. Failure to successfully complete the 2-week study run-in.\n9. Planned lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, or other major surgery during the next six months.\n10. Lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, coronary revascularization, or other major surgery in the previous three months.\n11. Participation in supervised treadmill exercise during the previous three months.\n12. Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. \\[NOTE: potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use oxygen at night may still qualify.\\]\n13. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score \\<23 or dementia.\n14. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months. \\[NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.\\]\n15. Currently taking a dose of 250 mg or more of nicotinamide riboside, vitamin B3, niacin. Currently taking a slow-release form of niacin. Currently taking resveratrol or has taken any these drug(s) in past six months. Participants taking a multi-vitamin will not be excluded if the dose of vitamin B3 is less than 250 mgs.\n16. Increase in angina or angina at rest\n17. Non-English speaking.\n18. Visual impairment that limits walking ability.\n19. Women who are pregnant or who are pre-menopausal will not be eligible.\n20. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.\n\nPotentially eligible participants will be advised that Medicare coverage for 12 weeks of supervised treadmill exercise is now available. Potential participants who have not participated in supervised treadmill exercise covered by Medicare and who desire to participate will be referred back to their physician for follow-up. These individuals may become eligible six months after they complete supervised treadmill exercise.\n\nVulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and institutionalized persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Six-minute Walk Distance (NR Alone vs. Placebo)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR alone improves six-minute walk distance at 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.93","spread":"7.84"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.00","spread":"8.69"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-10.58","spread":"8.45"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Six-minute Walk Distance (NR/Resveratrol vs. Placebo)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR combined with resveratrol improves six-minute walk performance at 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.93","spread":"7.84"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.00","spread":"8.69"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-10.58","spread":"8.45"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Six-minute Walk Distance (NR Alone vs. Placebo)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR alone improves six-minute walk performance at 3-month follow-up, compared to placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.99","spread":"7.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.78","spread":"8.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-17.64","spread":"8.03"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Six-minute Walk Distance (NR/Resveratrol vs. Placebo)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR combined with resveratrol improves six-minute walk performance at 3-month follow-up, compared to placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.99","spread":"7.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.78","spread":"8.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-17.64","spread":"8.03"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Six-minute Walk Distance (NR/Resveratrol vs. NR Alone)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR combined with resveratrol improves six-minute walk performance at 3-month follow-up, compared to NR alone.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.99","spread":"7.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.78","spread":"8.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-17.64","spread":"8.03"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Six-minute Walk Distance (NR/Resveratrol vs. NR Alone)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR combined with resveratrol improves six-minute walk performance at 6-month follow-up, compared to NR alone.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.93","spread":"7.84"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.00","spread":"8.69"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-10.58","spread":"8.45"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Maximal Treadmill Walking Time (NR Alone vs. Placebo)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR alone improves maximal treadmill walking time at 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.57","spread":"1.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.89","spread":"0.94"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.17","spread":"0.97"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) Distance Score (NR Alone vs. Placebo)","description":"Among participants with PAD, investigators will determine whether NR alone improves the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) distance score at 6-month follow-up, compared to placebo.\n\nThe WIQ is a well validated questionnaire that measures patient-reported walking limitations in distance and speed and stair-climbing.
