Unconfirmed virologic evaluation of ≥ 50 copies/mL after previously reaching viral suppression (transient detectable viremia, or \"blip\") and prior to screening is acceptable\n  * Documented positive HIV antibody test\n  * Screening HBV DNA \\< 9 log10 IU/mL\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females who are breastfeeding\n* Positive serum pregnancy test (female of childbearing potential)\n* Have an implanted defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Current alcohol or substance use\n* A history of malignancy within the past 5 years (prior to screening) or ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), basal cell carcinoma, or resected, non-invasive carcinoma.\n* Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant\n* Any history of, or current evidence of, clinical hepatic decompensation (e.g., ascites, encephalopathy or variceal hemorrhage).\n* Significant bone disease (e.g., osteomalacia, chronic osteomyelitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteochondroses), or multiple bone fractures\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to Day 1\n* Subjects on hemodialysis, other forms of renal replacement therapy, or on treatment for underlying kidney diseases (including prednisolone, and dexamethasone)\n* Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements\n* Investigational agents (unless approved by Gilead Sciences).
