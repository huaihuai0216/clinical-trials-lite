(Subjects with a previous ileo-rectal anastomosis are not excluded).\n* Subject who has received any investigational biological agent in the past 3 months or 5 half-lives prior to Baseline (whichever is longer).\n* Subjects with a poorly controlled medical condition and any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator or the sponsor, would put the subject at risk by participation in the protocol.\n* Subject who has previously used infliximab or any anti-TNF (anti tumor necrosis factor), even investigational, within 8 weeks of Baseline.\n* Subject who has previously used infliximab or any anti-TNF agent and has not clinically responded.\n* Previous treatment with adalimumab or previous participation in an adalimumab clinical study.\n* Subjects on prednisone \\> 40 mg/day (or equivalent).\n* Subjects on budesonide \\> 9 mg/day.\n* Subjects with any prior exposure to TysabriÂ® (natalizumab).\n* Subjects with a previous history of dysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or found to have dysplasia in any biopsy performed during the Screening endoscopy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Without Mucosal Ulceration at Week 12","description":"Subjects were to have undergone up to 4 endoscopies to evaluate the presence or absence of mucosal ulceration: at Screening, at Week 12 (subjects who moved to open label (OL) drug between Week 8 and Week 12 because of disease flare or non-response were evaluated by endoscopy prior to receiving OL dosing), at the time of switch from blinded study drug to OL adalimumab at any time after Week 12, and at Week 52 or Early Termination.
