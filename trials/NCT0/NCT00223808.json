The FMA evaluates motor function, sensation, balance, and joint function in hemiplegic patients and provides a cumulative numerical score. It is widely used to evaluate changes in function over time in clinical care and therapeutic trials following stroke. Five domains can be assessed, including motor function (upper and lower limbs); sensory function; balance; joint range of motion; and joint pain. Items within each domain are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale: 0 = cannot perform; 1 = performs partially; and 2 = performs fully. Subscales can be administered without the using the full test. For the upper limb motor function subscale used in this clinical trial, 33 items were evaluated, each rated on a 3-point scale (0-2), then summed for a maximum possible score of 66. A greater increase in the score represents a greater improvement in upper limb motor function.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.8","spread":"1.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.4","spread":"3.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"14.0","spread":"3.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Fugl-Meyer Score Change at 6 Months","description":"Change in Fugl-Meyer score at 6-months from study enrollment compared to baseline.
