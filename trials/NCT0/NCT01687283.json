This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID in treatment of Chinese adult and adolescent patients with severe persistent asthma for a treatment period of 12 weeks versus budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID. The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (Day 1 of Treatment Period/Visit 2) in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (AM PEF) Over 12 Weeks in Intent-to-treat Population","timeFrame":"Baseline (Visit 2) and up to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FP 1 mg BID","deltaMin":12.71,"sd":3.677},{"arm":"BUD 2 mg BID","deltaMin":14.51,"sd":3.714}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.733"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"17 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":158},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
