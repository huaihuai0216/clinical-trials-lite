This study will examine the hypothesis with measures of phosphate homeostasis and calcium reabsorption. A double-blind trial of the intestinal phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate will be employed to examine whether reductions in phosphate influx alter distal nephron phosphate concentration and the \\[PTH\\] required for calcium reabsorption in the expected manner.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Fractional Change in [PTH] in CKD After a 4-week Course of Sevelamer Carbonate","timeFrame":"4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sevelamer Carbonate","deltaMin":-11.7,"sd":5.8},{"arm":"Placebo Control","deltaMin":16.4,"sd":10}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40576086","29779023","26951967","25685872"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["nausea"]}}
