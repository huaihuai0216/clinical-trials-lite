Reductions were cited as negative numbers, and increments were cited as positive numbers.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-11.7","spread":"5.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.4","spread":"10.0"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["nausea"]}}}
