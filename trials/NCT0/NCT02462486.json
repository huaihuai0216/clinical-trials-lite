BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. The percentage of participants with a BCVA loss of fewer than 15 letters are reported. Study eye was defined as the eye that meets the entry criteria. If both the eyes met all of the entry criteria, the eye with worse BCVA at baseline (Day 1) was selected.

Overall composite score is then calculated by averaging over all 11 vision-targeted subscale scores, excluding general health score.
