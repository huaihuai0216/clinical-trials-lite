In this study, we will examine the efficacy of these therapies on metabolic parameters, body weight and body composition, anthropometric measurements, and reproductive function in a well-defined group of pre-menopausal overweight/obese, non-diabetic women with PCOS, focusing on their relationship to insulin resistance and obesity. We hope to determine which treatment(s) addressing the multifaceted disturbances of individual subgroups emerge as the preferable therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Oral Disposition (Insulin Sensitivity-insulin Secretion) Index","timeFrame":"24 weeks of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Exenatide Once Weekly (EQW )","deltaMin":471,"sd":83},{"arm":"Dapagliflozin (DAPA)","deltaMin":311,"sd":90},{"arm":"EQW Plus DAPA","deltaMin":503,"sd":80},{"arm":"Dapagliflozin Plus Glucophage (MET ER)","deltaMin":395,"sd":85},{"arm":"Phentermine /Topiramate (PHEN/ TPM) ER","deltaMin":545,"sd":93}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003 vs OG004","p":"<0.02"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34097062"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":23},"commonTop":["Yeast infection or urinary tract infection","Nausea and upset stomach","Injection site reaction","Insomnia","Vaginal irritation"]}}
