Participants recorded a sleep interference score in the patient diary once daily from the day after the screening visit (Visit 1) through the end-of-treatment (Visit 7)/early termination visit. Every morning upon awakening, prior to taking the study drug, each participant selected the number that best described his/her sleep interference experience during the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 = pain did not interfere with sleep to 10 = pain completely interfered with sleep.

Average time required to fall asleep, average hours of sleep per night, and ten questions based on sleep disturbance that were given a score of 1 (all the time) to 5 (none of the time). Based on the 12 questions, the following scales were calculated: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakening due to shortness of breath or headache, sleep adequacy, sleep somnolence, 9-item sleep item index, sleep quantity, and optimal sleep (not reported since it is a yes/no response). Each scale was given a score ranging from 1 (all the time) to 5 (none of the time), except for the 9-item sleep item index. Individual item scores of the 9-item sleep index were averaged and the total score ranged from 1 to 5. For all items reported, higher scores indicate an improvement in sleep disturbance.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.23","spread":"8.39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.27","spread":"7.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.12","spread":"7.89"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.61","spread":"7.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.04","spread":"12.64"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.71","spread":"9.90"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.94","spread":"9.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.81","spread":"8.44"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.18","spread":"10.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.05","spread":"7.85"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.70","spread":"7.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.29","spread":"6.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.3","spread":"1.46"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.93"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Hospital Anxiety & Depression Scale Following Administration With Mirogabalin or Placebo","description":"The Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) scale consisted of 7 items to score depression (4-point scale: 0 to 3; where a score of 3 indicates highest depression levels \\[worse outcome\\]) and 7 items to score anxiety (4-point scale: 0 to 3; where score of 3 indicates highest anxiety levels \\[worse outcome\\]).
