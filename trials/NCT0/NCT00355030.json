However, treatments were stopped in January 2012 at the request of the French drug agency. Therefore, a protocol amendment divided the study in two study periods.\n\nStudy Period 1 involved combined treatment with somatropin and leuprorelin or treatment with somatropin alone. Participants from France who participated in this Period 1 of the study were asked to participate in a long term safety follow up defined as a Period 2 of the study. Participants from the Netherlands were offered participation in Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS, clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01088412) for long term safety follow up independent of this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With One or More Drug-related Adverse Events","timeFrame":"Baseline through End of Study (up to 9 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Somatropin and Leuprorelin","deltaMin":42,"sd":null},{"arm":"Somatropin","deltaMin":38,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["France","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":46},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Influenza","Gastroenteritis","Abdominal pain"]}}
