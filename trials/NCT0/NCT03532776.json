Histological confirmation should be obtained if there is any doubt of the diagnosis.\n3. Females of childbearing potential may be enrolled if they practice a method of birth control with a reliability of at least 90%.\n4. Sexually active study participants must agree to abstain from sexual activity of any kind throughout the treatment period to prevent cross- and reinfection by HPV.\n5. Any female subject with childbearing potential has a negative urine pregnancy test at Baseline.\n6. Negative HIV test within 4 weeks before Baseline.\n\n   Exclusion Criteria:\n7. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study period.\n8. Hypersensitivity or intolerance to Podofilox or any component of the formulation.\n9. History of previous unsuccessful treatment with any formulation of Podofilox.\n10. Wart area that is greater than 10 cm2.\n11.

Use within 4 weeks prior to baseline of any: 1) treatment for anogenital warts, 2) systemic corticosteroids, or 3) systemic immunosuppressive drug.\n16. Any medical or surgical condition in the judgment of the Investigator that may interfere with the assessment of efficacy or safety, or pose a risk to the subject.\n17. Patients known to abuse alcohol and/or drugs, or with a history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse that may result in protocol noncompliance.\n18. Received another investigational drug, device or biologic within 90 days prior to the start of Screening or has planned to participate in another clinical trial while enrolled in this study.\n19. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator, are unlikely to be able to follow the restrictions of the protocol and complete the study\n20. Employee (or employee's family member) of the research center or private practice, CRO or Sponsor, or subjects who have a conflict of interest.\n21. Subjects living (e.g., siblings, spouses, relatives, roommates) in the same household cannot be enrolled in the study at the same time.\n22.
