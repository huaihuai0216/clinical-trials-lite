Prior/Concomitant therapy\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug, vaccine or medical device) other than the study vaccines during the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccines (Day -29 to Day 1), or planned use during the study period.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first dose and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine administration, with the exception of the inactivated influenza vaccine, which is allowed at any time during the study, and other licensed routine childhood vaccinations.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study period (e.g. infliximab).\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products from birth or planned administration during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Previous vaccination against RV.
