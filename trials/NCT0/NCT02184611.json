Over approximate 27 weeks of entire study duration, 10 study clinic visits will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Pre-screening visit will be conducted for the informed consent form, review demography, COPD history and COPD concomitant medications. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria at screening will complete a 7 to 14 day Run-in period and will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol as rescue medication on an \"as-needed\" basis. Further, subjects will be randomized to the UMEC 62.5 mcg or matching placebo in a 1:2 ratio for 24 week treatment period. A follow up for adverse event assessment will be scheduled approximately 7 days after the treatment period or the Early Withdrawal Visit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Trough (Pre-bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) on Treatment Day 169","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 1) and Day 169","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.022,"sd":0.0171},{"arm":"UMEC 62.5 mcg","deltaMin":0.131,"sd":0.0117}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["China","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32368027"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":101},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Dizziness","Urinary tract infection","Blood glucose increased"]}}
