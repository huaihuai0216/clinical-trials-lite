Subject is ≥18 years old.\n2. Diagnosed with ITP for at least 12 months prior to screening, and have a platelet count of \\<30 X109/L on Day 1 (or within 48 hours prior to dosing on Day 1).\n3. Patients who have no response or relapsed after splenectomy. Or patients who have not been splenectomised and have either not responded to one or more prior therapies (except splenectomy), or who have relapsed prior therapy.\n4. Previous therapy for ITP including rescue must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n5. Subjects treated with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy must be receiving a dose that has been stable for at least 1 month.\n6. No pre-existing cardiac disease within the last 3 months. No arrhythmia known to increase the risk of thrombolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), or patients with a Corrected QT interval (QTc) \\>450msec or QTc \\>480 for patients with a Bundle Branch Block.\n7. No history of clotting disorder, other than ITP.\n8. A complete blood count (CBC), within the reference range, with the following exceptions:\n\n   * Platelets \\<30×109/L on Day 1 (or within 48hours of Day 1) is required for inclusion,\n   * Hemoglobin: females and males 10.0 g/dl are eligible for inclusion,\n   * Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/µL (1.5×109/L) is required for inclusion\n9.

Patients with any prior history of arterial or venous thrombosis, AND ≥ two of the following risk factors: hormone replacement therapy, systemic contraception (containing estrogen), smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, medication for hypertension, cancer, hereditary thrombophilic disorders (e.g., Factor V Leiden, ATIII deficiency, antiphospholipid syndrome, etc).\n2. Any clinically relevant abnormality, other than ITP,which in the opinion of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.\n3. Female subjects who are nursing or pregnant at screening or pre-dose on Day 1.\n4. History of alcohol/drug abuse or dependence within 12 months of the study.\n5.

An abnormality in bone marrow examination result, other than ITP, identified on the screening examination, which in the opinion of the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study (e.g. ≥MF-2 according to EU consensus scale \\[Thiele, 2005\\]) or suggests another primary diagnosis (e.g. Thrombocytopenia is secondary to another disease).\n11. Any laboratory or clinical evidence for HIV infection.\n12.
