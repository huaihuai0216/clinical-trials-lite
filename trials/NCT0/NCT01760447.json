The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin reduces glycated hemoglobin (A1C) more than the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 20","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 20","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin/Metformin and Sitagliptin/Metformin XR Pooled","deltaMin":-0.58,"sd":null},{"arm":"Metformin and Metformin XR Pooled","deltaMin":-0.09,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.018"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["34779103"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":62},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea"]}}
