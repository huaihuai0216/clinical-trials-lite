It measures the following burdens: cognitive (mental effort or concentration required for complexity of task), time (amount of spare time, interruptions, overlapping tasks) and psychological stress associated with work that impacts performance. The SWAT uses a ranking system to weight perceived workload which results in an overall score ranging from 0-100, where higher scores indicate higher perceived workload.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"50.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Nursing Workload: NASA-TLX (National Aeronautics and Space Administration - Task Load Index) Instrument","description":"The cognitive burden placed upon bedside nurses when managing a patient on TGC will be described.
