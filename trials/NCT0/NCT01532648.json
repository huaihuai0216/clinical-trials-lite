Limited distal proctitis (from anal verge to 15 centimeters \\[cm\\] above the pectineal line).\n2.

Participants with a history of pancolitis (disease that extends to the hepatic flexure or beyond) for ≥8 years or left-sided colitis (disease confined to the left colon \\[that is, distal to the splenic flexure\\]) ≥15 years who have not yet completed a surveillance colonoscopy for dysplasia/colorectal cancer screening within the past year.\n18. Prior budesonide MMX treatment.\n19. Use of oral corticosteroids including other budesonide formulations within the last 4 weeks prior to randomization.\n20. Use of any rectal 5-ASA or corticosteroid formulations within the last 2 weeks prior to randomization.\n21. Use of immunosuppressive agents within the last 8 weeks prior to randomization.\n22. Use of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) agents or other biologic therapies within the last 3 months prior to randomization.\n23. Participation in experimental therapeutic studies within 30 days of randomization (or within the last 3 months if in an anti-TNFα or biologic agent study). Note: participants who participated in observational-only studies (and who did not receive study therapy) are not excluded.\n24. Any other medical condition that, in the Principal Investigator's opinion, would make the administration of the study drug or study procedures hazardous to the participant or obscure the interpretation of adverse events (AEs) by the appropriate independent ethics committee/institutional review board.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission at Day 56","description":"Clinical remission defined as a score of 0 for rectal bleeding and 0 for stool frequency components from the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI).
