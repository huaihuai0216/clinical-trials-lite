The WST is an instrument for the objective evaluation of wheelchair skills. The WST consists of a series of commonly used wheelchair skills spanning the spectrum from those as basic as applying brakes to those as difficult as climbing curbs and performing wheelies. The WSC encompasses 57 skills (in Version 4.1) which result in a total score. The WST provide a pass-fail score for each skill. Refusal to attempt a skill (e.g. because of fear) constitutes a failing grade. The numerator is the Total Raw Score (i.e., the number of individual skills awarded a passing score) and the denominator is the number of applicable skills (i.e., the total number of skills minus those awarded NP scores). 100% is the maximum possible percentage score.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"90.4","spread":"11.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"89.6","spread":"11.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART): Physical Independence Subscale","description":"Use as a measure of handicap that captures the interaction of the person and the environment, and of community reintegration and participation. The CHART quantifies handicap by evaluating five domains: physical independence, mobility, occupation, social integration, and economic self-sufficiency.

High scores indicate lesser handicap. The CHART was developed as a specific instrument to measure handicap, is the only measure of that concept validated specifically for persons with SCI, and is currently the most widely used measure related to community reintegration in SCI.
