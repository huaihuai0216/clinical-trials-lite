The proposed training program incorporates emerging evidence on wheelchair biomechanics and motor-skills learning, and addresses recommendations in a new clinical practice guideline. Given the difficulty in translating wheelchair skills learned in a therapy clinic with \"real world\" problems in the home and community post-discharge, we are proposing to conduct the wheelchair skills training in and around the veteran's home. The immediate goal is to enhance ability, performance time, safety, community participation, and quality of life, while minimizing physical strain. The ultimate goal is to reduce morbidity/mortality associated with wheelchair use and promote successful aging with a disability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Wheelchair Skills Test (WST)","timeFrame":"long term (1 year)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Wheelchair Skills Training Program","deltaMin":90.4,"sd":11.2},{"arm":"Basic Health Education","deltaMin":89.6,"sd":11.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":69},"commonTop":[]}}
