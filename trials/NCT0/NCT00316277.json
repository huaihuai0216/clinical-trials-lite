This will be examined during: a) an initial four-week treatment with taper; b) a 12-week stabilization treatment for those who do not respond successfully to the initial treatment; and c) a long-term follow-up assessment at 1.5 years, 2.5 years, and 3.5 years after treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Number of Participants Attaining Successful Opioid Use Outcome by Counseling Condition at End of Phase 1","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Buprenorphine/Nx With EMM","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Buprenorphine/Nx With SMM","deltaMin":24,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20116457","20079463","20163386","20558415","23333292","22065255","40833692","38616571","31715440","30920187","25562462","25189089","24219166"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":329},"commonTop":["Headache","Constipation","Insomnia","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
