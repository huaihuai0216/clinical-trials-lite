A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information.\n* Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local legislation prior to admission to the trial\n\nCohort A Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)\n\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% as measured by ECHO at screening\n* The following signs of heart failure;\n\n  * Elevated NT-proBNP (\\>125 pg/mL) at screening in patient without atrial fibrillation (AF)\n  * Elevated NT-proBNP (\\>600 pg/mL) at screening in patient with AF\n* Appropriate dose of medical therapy for HF (such as ACEi, ARB, β-blocker, oral diuretics, MRA, ARNI, ivabradine) consistent with prevailing local and international HF guidelines, stable for at least one week prior to Visit 1 and during screening period until Visit 2 (Randomisation) with the exception of diuretics which must be stable for at least one week prior to Visit 2 to control symptoms. If required, the investigator must document in the source documents the reason why the patient is not on the target dose per local guidelines.\n\nCohort B Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)\n\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% as measured by ECHO at screening and no previous measurement of LVEF ≤ 40%.\n* The following combined signs of heart failure;\n\n  * Structural heart disease (LA enlargement \\[LAVI \\>34 mL/m2\\] and/or LVH \\[LVMI ≥ 115 g/m2 for males and ≥ 95 g/m2 for females\\]) by ECHO at screening or within 3 months prior to informed consent AND\n  * NT-proBNP \\> 125pg/mL at screening in patient without AF or NT-pro-BNP \\> 600 pg/mL in patient with AF\n* Oral diuretics, if prescribed, should be stable for at least one week prior to Visit 1 and during screening period until Visit 2 (Randomisation).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to informed consent.\n* Any patients with myocardial scars and/or non-viable myocardium in the interventricular septum, unstable angina due to significant coronary artery disease (CAD), or major (in the opinion of the investigator) cardiovascular surgery.\n* Any contraindication for MRI, CPET and/or dobutamine stress test in accordance with the institution guidance, including implanted left ventricular assist device (LVAD),implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) or any cardiac device.\n* Heart transplant recipient or listed for heart transplant\n* Cardiomyopathy based on infiltrative diseases (e.g. amyloidosis), accumulation diseases (e.g. haemochromatosis, Fabry disease), muscular dystrophies, cardiomyopathy with reversible causes (e.g. stress cardiomyopathy), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or known pericardial constriction\n* Moderate to severe uncorrected valvular heart disease, obstructive or regurgitant, or any valvular heart disease expected to lead to surgery in the Investigator's opinion\n* Acute decompensated HF (exacerbation of chronic HF) requiring intravenous (i.v.) diuretics, i.v. inotropes or i.v. vasodilators, or LVAD or hospitalisation within 1 week prior to Visit 1 (Screening), or during screening period until Visit 2 (Randomisation)\n* Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 180 mmHg at screening.
