diseases or conditions other than COPD, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the subject at risk because of participation in the study or may influence either the results of the study or the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n* Women who are pregnant or lactating, or are planning to become pregnant during the course of the study, or women of childbearing potential who are not using an acceptable method of contraception.\n* Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, have a current diagnosis of asthma.\n* Subjects who have been hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or during the Screening Period\n* Subjects who have poorly controlled COPD, defined as acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment with oral corticosteroids or antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) or during the Screening Period\n* Immune suppression or severe neurological disorders affecting control of the upper airway or other risk factors that in the opinion of the Investigator would put the subject at substantial risk of pneumonia.\n* Subjects with a diagnosis of narrow angle glaucoma, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have not been adequately treated.\n* Subjects who have a history of hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, budesonide or any other corticosteroid components, glycopyrronium or other
