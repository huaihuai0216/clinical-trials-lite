The study will also explore the bactericidal antibody persistence at 12, 18 and 24 months of age, following the two different immunization schedules, in order to identify the optimal timing for boosting. Two catch-up rMenB+OMV NZ doses will be given to unprimed, naïve toddlers at 12 (subjects enrolled in the control group of V72P12), 18 and 24 months of age (two new cohort of subjects enrolled). These subjects will generate data for assessing the safety and immunogenicity of a two-dose catch-up regimen at these ages, but will also serve as controls for a descriptive comparison of antibody persistence and booster responses for the other groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentages of Subjects With Serum Bactericidal Antibody Titers ≥1:5 After Receiving a Fourth (Booster) Dose of rMenB+OMV NZ Vaccination in Subjects Who Previously Received 3 Doses of rMenB+OMV NZ and Routine Vaccines at 2, 4 and 6 Months of Age.","timeFrame":"1 month after booster","effectByArm":[{"arm":"B+R246_12","deltaMin":97,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R246_18","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"B+R246_24","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["Belgium","Czechia","Germany","Italy","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33020485","26756390"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":185},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Irritability","Injection site induration","Somnolence"]}}
