The investigators hypothesize that this drug combination will reduce the symptoms of acute mountain sickness and improve exercise performance at high altitude compared to placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time (Minutes) to Complete 2 Miles on a Treadmill","timeFrame":"after arriving at high altitude (within 1 hour)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ambrisentan and Theophylline","deltaMin":1544,"sd":109},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1540,"sd":158}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":14},"commonTop":[]}}
