With the proven efficacy of these antiviral drugs in pre- and post-clinical trials, we would like to investigate the ability of the combination of raltegravir and maraviroc plus a standard HAART backbone to further decrease the viral load in acutely infected treated HIV infected individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Proviral HIV-1 DNA in Total CD4+ T-cells From Baseline to Week 48 in Participants Randomized to the Intensified Arm Versus the Control Arm Who Received Placebo in Addition to Standard HAART.","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intensive HAART","deltaMin":279,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Arm","deltaMin":244,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.056"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":16},"commonTop":[]}}
