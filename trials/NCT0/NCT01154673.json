Positive or weakly positive HIV-1 antibody screening ELISA test result, with indeterminate and evolving confirmatory test result with demonstrated HIV-1 antigenemia (p24 antigen test result) or viremia (HIV-1 bDNA ≥ 500 copies/ml) or\n3. Negative HIV-1 antibody test result in the setting of an illness compatible with acute seroconversion with demonstrated HIV-1 antigenemia (p24 antigen test result) or plasma viremia (HIV-1 bDNA ≥ 500 copies/ml)\n\nOther inclusion criteria are:\n\n* Ages 18 or older\n* Ability to provide informed consent\n* HIV-1 viral load ≥ 5,000 copies/ml\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
