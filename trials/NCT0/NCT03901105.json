The clinical dementia rating (CDR) examines 6 categories of cognitive functioning domains. Each domain is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (including 0.5). A CDR-SB was generated as the sum of the values in each of the 6 domains. The CDR-SB sum scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and a 1 point worsening is considered a clinically significant symptom change.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"119","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"43","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Risk Ratio for AD Symptom Progression on Various Clinical Measures","description":"Baseline flortaucipir F 18 PET imaging results were determined by majority read (see Baseline Characteristics for description).
