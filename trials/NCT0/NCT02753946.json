Women of childbearing potential have had a negative pregnancy test before randomization and be willing to consistently use a highly effective method of contraception\n10. Male study participants will be required to use condoms with a spermicide throughout study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Presence of any of the following conditions: perinephric abscess, renal corticomedullary abscess, uncomplicated urinary tract infection, recent history of trauma to the pelvis or urinary tract, polycystic kidney disease, chronic vesicoureteral reflux, previous or planned renal transplantation; patients receiving dialysis/hemodialysis/CVVH, previous or planned cystectomy or ileal loop surgery; known or suspected infection; caused by pathogen resistant to study treatment antibiotics\n2. Presence of suspected or confirmed acute bacterial prostatitis, orchitis, epididymitis, or chronic bacterial prostatitis as determined by history and/or physical examination;\n3. Gross hematuria requiring intervention;\n4. Urinary tract surgery within 7 days prior to randomization or urinary tract surgery planned during the study period;\n5. Creatinine clearance \\<20 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula;\n6.

Signs of severe sepsis as defined per protocol;\n8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women;\n9. Known seizure disorder requiring current treatment with anti-seizure medication which would prohibit the patient from complying with the protocol;\n10.

Significant hepatic disease or dysfunction, including known acute viral hepatitis or hepatic encephalopathy;\n12. ALT/AST \\>5 × ULN or total bilirubin \\>3 × ULN at Screening;\n13. Receipt of any potentially-effective systemic antibiotic with activity against Gram-negative uropathogens for more than 24 hours within the 72-hour window prior to randomization (exceptions defined in protocol);\n14. Requirement for additional systemic antibiotic therapy (other than study drug) or antifungal therapy for vaginal candidiasis;\n15. Likely to require the use of an antibiotic for cUTI or AP prophylaxis during the study;\n16. Known history of HIV virus infection and known recent CD4 count \\<200/mm3;\n17. Presence of significant immunodeficiency or an immunocompromised condition and long-term use of systemic corticosteroids;\n18. Presence of neutropenia;\n19. Presence of thrombocytopenia;\n20. A QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula \\>480 msec;\n21. History of significant hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to fosfomycin, any contraindication to the use of piperacillin/tazobactam;\n22. Participation in a clinical study involving investigational medication or investigational device within the last 30 days prior to randomization;\n23. Inability, in the judgment of the Investigator, to tolerate the salt load required for study drug administration;\n24. Unable or unwilling, in the judgment of the Investigator, to comply with the protocol;\n25.
