If the remission is less than 12 months, Medical Monitor or Protocol Chair approval is required for eligibility\n\nPatient Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior allogeneic or autologous transplants using any hematopoietic stem cell source; patients with secondary malignancies who have had a prior autologous transplant will be eligible; the prior autologous transplant must have been performed for the primary malignancy (such as lymphoma) and must have occurred 12 or more months prior to enrollment\n* Lymphoma (11% of 2001 NMDP transplants), other malignant disorders (6%), and non-malignant disorders (9%)\n\nDonor Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Matched for HLA-A, B, and DRB1 antigens\n\n  1. One antigen mismatch at HLA-A, B, or DRB1 is acceptable with or without mismatch at HLA-C\n  2. Typing is by DNA techniques: intermediate resolution for A, B, and C, and high resolution for DRB1. HLA-C typing is mandatory but will not count in the match.\n* Willing to undergo both bone marrow harvest and G-CSF administration with apheresis\n* Willing to be randomly assigned to either marrow or PBSC collection\n* Adequate peripheral venous access for leukapheresis or willing to undergo placement of a central catheter\n* Donor center affiliation with NMDP\n* Additional donor inclusion criteria can be found in the Donor Companion Manual\n\nDonor Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant (positive serum Î²-HCG) or uninterruptible breastfeeding\n* Known allergy to G-CSF or to E. Coli-derived recombinant protein products\n* History of autoimmune disorders\n* History of deep vein thrombosis or venous thromboembolism\n* History of iritis or episcleritis\n* History of serious adverse reaction to anesthesia\n* Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 150,000 per mcL) at baseline evaluation\n* Current treatment with lithium\n* Presence of sickle hemoglobin as demonstrated by appropriate testing such as hemoglobin electrophoresis\n* Receiving experimental therapy or investigational agents","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"66
