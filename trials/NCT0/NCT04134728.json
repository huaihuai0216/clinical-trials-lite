The study will consist of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks followed by 24 week treatment phase in which participants will be randomized in ratio of 6:6:6:1:1:1 to GSK3196165 150 milligrams (mg) subcutaneously (SC) weekly,GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, sarilumab 200 mg SC every other week or placebo (three arms) respectively, all in combination with background csDMARD(s). At Week 12, participants in the three placebo arms will switch from placebo to active intervention (either GSK3196165 150 mg SC weekly, GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, or sarilumab 200 mg SC every other week). Participants who, in investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with GSK3196165, may be included in the long-term extension study (contRAst X \\[209564: NCT04333147\\]). Any participant who does not transition into study 209564 will undergo a safety follow-up visit at Week 34 (corresponding to 12 weeks after the last potential dose of sarilumab, at Week 22).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With 20% Improvement in American College of Rheumatology Criteria (ACR20) at Week 12 Superiority Comparison With Placebo","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GSK3196165 90mg + csDMARD","deltaMin":44.8,"sd":4.19},{"arm":"GSK3196165 150mg + csDMARD","deltaMin":50.7,"sd":4.12},{"arm":"Sarilumab 200mg + csDMARD","deltaMin":57.5,"sd":4.19},{"arm":"Pooled Placebo","deltaMin":37.7,"sd":5.74}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.2868"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0596"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0049"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0293"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.2308"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":131,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Lithuania","Poland","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37696589"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04333147?term=209564&draw=2&rank=1"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":156},"commonTop":["Injection site reaction","Urinary tract infection","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Neutropenia","Cough"]}}
