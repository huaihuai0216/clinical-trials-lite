The MSFC score was calculated as the mean of the Z-scores of the 3 components. A Z-score was calculated by subtracting the mean of the reference population from the test result, then dividing by the standard deviation of the reference population. Higher Z-scores reflected better neurological function and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicated an improvement (Z-score range: -3 to +3).
