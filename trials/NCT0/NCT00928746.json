A diagnosis of COPD based on medical history at a severity to require maintenance treatment with a bronchodilator\n2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older\n3. A smoking history of more than ten pack-years. A pack-year is defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of 20 cigarettes per day for a year\n4. Must be able to use the study MDI with the mouthpiece containing actuation indicator\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Significant diseases other than COPD are excluded. A significant disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study\n2. Malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation therapy or chemotherapy within the last three months. Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed\n3. History of asthma\n4. Significant history active alcohol or drug abuse\n5. Known active tuberculosis\n6. Known narrow-angle glaucoma\n7. Current significant psychiatric disorders\n8. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices or diaphragm with spermicide, or NorplantÂ®)\n9. Known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, any other component of the ipratropium bromide, HFA-134a or MDI components\n10. Previous participation in this trial\n11.
