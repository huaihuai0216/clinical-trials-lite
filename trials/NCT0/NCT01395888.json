Arterial stiffness will be measured as aPWV. This is a comparator, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multi-centre study. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening and meet the randomization criteria at the end of a 2-week Run-In period will enter a 12-week treatment period. There will be an approximate 7-day Follow-up period after the treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (aPWV) at the End of the 12-week Treatment Period (Day 84)","timeFrame":"Baseline to Day 84 (Early Withdrawal)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FF/VI 100/25 µg","deltaMin":-0.859,"sd":0.259},{"arm":"Tiotropium Bromide 18 µg","deltaMin":-1.118,"sd":0.262}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.484"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["Argentina","France","Germany","Italy","Norway","Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25058845"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":127},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache"]}}
