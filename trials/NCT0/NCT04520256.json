In order to maximize the public health benefit of disseminating these treatments online, this study will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework to most quickly and efficiently determine which, if any, of 5 innovative intervention components, alone or in combination, increases the proportion of patients achieving a â‰¥5% weight loss, and mean weight loss, after a 12-month online behavioral obesity treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Weight Change (Percent of Initial Body Weight) From Baseline to Month 12, Main Effect of Time","timeFrame":"From Baseline to Month 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All Participants","deltaMin":-5.8,"sd":0.87}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}
