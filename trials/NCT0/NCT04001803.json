Cabotegravir (CAB) is a potent integrase inhibitor (INI) and rilpivirine (RPV) is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). A two-drug regimen (DR)with CAB plus RPV long acting (LA) product offers many potential advantages over daily oral regimens including better tolerability, improved compliance, adherence, less likely to develop resistance, and overall treatment satisfaction in virologically suppressed subjects. This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, short term facilitation study to evaluate the effect of an implementation strategy on the degree of acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity and sustainability of clinical practices to deliver the CAB+RPV LA regimen to HIV infected subjects and to also measure subject satisfaction by recording timeliness of visits, length of visit and their education. Approximately 135 subjects will be enrolled in the study and the total duration of the study will be approximately 52-weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) Total Score in Staff Study Participants at Month 4","timeFrame":"Baseline and Month 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Staff Study Participants","deltaMin":0,"sd":0.42}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36094142","36097674"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":115},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site discomfort","Fatigue","Arthralgia","Diarrhoea"]}}
