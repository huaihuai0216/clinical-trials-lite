The duration of the castration period must be at least 4 months before screening as evidenced by combination of clinical/laboratory data (see section 6.8.1).\n* Laboratory criteria:\n\n  * White blood cells (WBC) greater than 4,000/mm3 (4.0 x109/L)\n  * Neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mm3 (1.5 x109/L).\n  * Hemoglobin of at least 10 g/dL (100 g/L).\n  * Platelet count of at least 100,000/mm3 (100 x 109/L).\n  * Total bilirubin within normal limits (benign hereditary hyperbilirubinemias, e.g. Gilbert's syndrome, are permitted).\n  * Serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine \\< 1.5x times the upper limit of normal (ULN).\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months based on Investigator's judgment.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0-2.\n* At least 4 weeks after surgery or radiotherapy before randomization.\n* A minimum of 28 days beyond initiation of bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy before randomization.\n* Recovery from primary local surgical treatment, radiotherapy or orchiectomy before randomization.\n* Signed informed consent including patient's ability to comprehend its contents.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Confirmed brain and/or leptomeningeal metastases (other visceral metastases are acceptable).\n* Current symptomatic spinal cord compression requiring surgery or radiation therapy.\n* Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer.\n* Patient co-morbidities:\n\n  * Subjects who are not indicated for chemotherapy treatment with first line Standard of Care chemotherapy (docetaxel and prednisone).\n  * HIV positive, human T-lymphotropic virus positive.\n  * Active hepatitis B (active hepatitis B), active hepatitis C (HCV), active syphilis.\n  * Evidence of active bacterial, viral or fungal infection requiring systemic treatment.\n  * Clinically significant cardiovascular disease including:\n\n    * symptomatic congestive heart failure.\n    * unstable angina pectoris.\n    * serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\n    * uncontrolled hypertension.\n    * myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia or stroke within a 6 months before screening, known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \\< 40% or serious cardiac conduction system disorders, if a pacemaker is not present.\n  * Pleural and pericardial effusion of any NCI CTCAE grade.\n  * Peripheral neuropathy having a NCI CTCAE ≥ grade 2.\n  * History of malignant disease (with the exception of non-melanoma skin tumors) in the preceding five years.\n  * Active autoimmune disease requiring treatment.\n  * History of severe forms of primary immune deficiencies.\n  * History of anaphylaxis or other serious reaction following vaccination.\n  * Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the DCVAC/PCa or placebo product.\n  * Uncontrolled co-morbidities including, psychiatric or social conditions which, in the Investigator's opinion, would prevent participation in the trial.\n* Systemic corticosteroids at doses greater than 40 mg hydrocortisone daily or equivalent for any reason other than treatment of PCa within 6 months before randomization.\n* Ongoing systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason.\n* Treatment with anti-androgens, inhibitors of adrenal-produced androgens or other hormonal tumor-focused treatment performed on the day of randomization (except for GnRH/LHRH agonists or antagonists) to exclude possible anti-androgen withdrawal response. This criterion is not applicable to subjects who have never responded to anti-androgen treatment, as there is no risk of anti-androgen withdrawal response.\n* Treatment with immunotherapy against PCa within 6 months before randomization.\n* Treatment with radiopharmaceutical within 8 weeks before randomization.\n* Participation in a clinical trial using non-immunological experimental therapy within 4 weeks before randomization.\n* Participation in a clinical trial using immunological experimental therapy (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, cytokines or active cellular immunotherapies) within 6 months before randomization.\n* Refusal to sign the informed consent.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Survival, Intention-to-treat Population","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival, Per Protocol Population","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival, Intention-to-treat Population, Abiraterone as Prior Therapy","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival, Intention-to-treat Population, Enzalutamide as Prior Therapy","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival, Intention-to-treat Population, no Prior Abiraterone or Enzalutamide","description":"Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Radiological Progression-free Survival, Intention-to-treat Population","description":"Progressive disease on bone scans was defined as a minimum of two new lesions.
