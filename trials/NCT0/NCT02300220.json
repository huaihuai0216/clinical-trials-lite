Diagnosis of COPD confirmed spirometrically at screening\n2. COPD exacerbation with treatment commenced 14 days prior to study enrolment and treated with 5-14 days of a non-quinolone antibiotic.\n3. Exacerbation here will be defined as an episode of symptomatic worsening of COPD that was treated by the patient's attending clinician. Confirmation of the initial exacerbation diagnosis will be provided from the case notes, referral letter, or directly from the treating clinician, and will be documented in the CRF.\n4. Age: ≥ 45 years of age at screening.\n5. Persistent symptoms and/or a CRP≥8mg/L when assessed 2 weeks after exacerbation onset\n6. Able to complete questionnaires for health status and symptoms and keep written diary cards\n7. Severity of disease: Patients with a measured FEV1\\<80% of predicted normal values at 2 weeks post exacerbation\n8. Able and willing to give signed and dated written informed consent to participate.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Other clinically predominant chronic respiratory disease.\n2. Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation\n3. Patients with known hypersensitivity to the antibiotic under evaluation, to other quinolones or any excipients of the IMP/placebo.\n4. Patients with a prior history of tendonopathy or tendon rupture\n5. Elderly patients taking long term systemic corticosteroids\n6. Patients on long term antibiotics for other conditions\n7. Patient too unwell for randomisation, i.e. requiring retreatment in the judgment of the study doctor\n8. Female patients who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant during the study, or are breastfeeding.\n9. Patient taking clinically significant contraindicated medication as per the SmPC s, such as use of concomitant tizanidine or methotrexate.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to the Next COPD Exacerbation","description":"The primary outcome will be the time to the next COPD exacerbation following targeted retreatment with the IMP or placebo, censored at 90 days.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"72","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"58","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Duration of the Initial Exacerbation","description":"Secondary endpoints will include duration of the initial exacerbation following targeted retreatment with the IMP or placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Serious Non Fatal Adverse Events","description":"Secondary endpoints will include adverse events following targeted retreatment with the IMP or placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes in Lung Function","description":"Secondary endpoints will include changes from randomization to 90 days in FEV1.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0229","spread":"0.199"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0041","spread":"0.198"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Have Resistance Bacteria in the Sputum","description":"Bacterial load and resistance Secondary endpoints will include resistance following targeted retreatment with the IMP or placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Hospital Readmission","description":"Secondary endpoints will include hospital readmission following targeted retreatment with the IMP or placebo.","classes":[]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":72},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Abdominal Colic/Pain","Nausea","Pruritis/Rash","Ankle Pain/Tendonitis"]}}}
