In severe COPD subjects, sputum eosinophils levels are elevated to similar levels as those seen in severe asthmatics. It is hypothesized that the reduction of eosinophils with mepolizumab in COPD subjects would translate into a reduction of COPD exacerbations. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, in subjects who are at or above the baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microliters who exacerbate despite regular use of maximal tolerated therapy, appropriate for severe COPD subjects, in the 12 months prior to study start. In total, 660 subjects will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive mepolizumab 300 mg, mepolizumab 100mg, or placebo administered SC. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a 1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week treatment period and 8-week follow-up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Moderate or Severe Exacerbations","timeFrame":"From randomization to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.49,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mepolizumab 100 mg SC","deltaMin":1.19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mepolizumab 300 mg SC","deltaMin":1.27,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.068"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.034"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.140"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.140"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":31},"locations":{"siteCount":169,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","Chile","Denmark","Germany","Japan","Netherlands","Romania","Slovakia","South Korea","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34163157","31295674","30406948","28893134"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":68,"n":226},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Back pain","Cough"]}}
