In addition, patients with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study physician, contraindicates the subject's participation will also be excluded.\n* Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years.\n* Oxygen therapy: Subjects receiving treatment with long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) or nocturnal oxygen therapy required for greater than 12 hours a day. Oxygen prn use (i.e. \\<=12 hours per day) is not exclusionary.\n* Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to participate in the study or the potential compliance to study procedures.\n* Affiliation with investigator site: Study investigators, sub-investigators, study coordinators, employees of a participating investigator or immediate family members of the aforementioned are excluded from participating in this study.\n* Additional medication: Use of the following medications within the following time intervals prior to Visit 1 or during the study (unless otherwise specified):\n\nMedication No use within the following time intervals prior to Screening or thereafter at any time during the study (unless otherwise specified) Inhaled Long acting beta-agonists (LABA) 48 hours ICS/LABA combination products 48 hours Inhaled corticosteroids 48 hours Tiotropium 1 week Systemic, Oral, parenteral, intra-articular corticosteroids 30 days (oral and systemic corticosteroids may be used to treat COPD exacerbations during the study) Cytochrome P450 3A4 strong inhibitors including but not limited to antiretrovirals (protease inhibitors) (e.g.Indinavir, Nelfinavir, Ritonavir, Saquinavir); Imidazole and Triazole anti-fungals (e.g. Ketaconazole, Itraconazole); Clarithromycin, Telithromycin, Amiodarone, and Nefazodone 6 weeks Grapefruit is allowed up to Visit 1, then limited to no more than one glass of grapefruit juice (250 mL/ 8 ounces) or one grapefruit per day Any other investigational drug 30 days or 5 half lives whichever is longer.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Death (Both on and Off Treatment) Due to Any Cause, Time up to or on the Pre-determined Common End Date","description":"Death from any cause: which occurred from the day of starting IP until the Commone End Date (CED).

The effect of treatment on decline of post bronchodilator FEV1 recorded during the treatment period was analyzed using a particular form of a mixed effect model - a random coefficients model. FEV1 was fitted as the response variable with treatment group, age, gender, baseline FEV1 and time on treatment as fixed effects. Time on treatment was treated as a continuous variable. This model allowed for an initial increase in FEV1, but then tested the difference in slopes from the first post-baseline measurement which was at 3 months. A negative slope indicates a decline. A positive treatment difference indicates a slower rate of decline vs Placebo or Component. Only participants with at least one on-treatment post-bronchodilator FEV1 measurement were analyzed.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-46","spread":"2.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-38","spread":"2.4"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-47","spread":"2.4"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-38","spread":"2.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With First On-treatment Cardiovascular (CV) Composite Events Occured on or Before Common End Date","description":"On-treatment CV composite event is comprised of the first event that is adjudicated as on-treatment CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, or transient ischemic attack experienced by a participant.
