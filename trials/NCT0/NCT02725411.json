Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":"0.78"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.2","spread":"0.95"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.3","spread":"0.97"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":"0.81"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.6","spread":"0.82"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.6","spread":"0.81"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.4","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.4","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.3","spread":"0.79"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.9","spread":"0.69"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.9","spread":"0.71"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.9","spread":"0.64"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":"0.83"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.8","spread":"0.97"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.6","spread":"0.81"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.6","spread":"0.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.5","spread":"0.80"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.5","spread":"0.77"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.2","spread":"0.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.1","spread":"0.35"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.2","spread":"0.48"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.6","spread":"0.71"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.5","spread":"0.66"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.6","spread":"0.69"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":"0.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0","spread":"0.75"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2.1","spread":"0.67"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.2","spread":"0.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.2","spread":"0.52"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.2","spread":"0.47"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.3","spread":"0.55"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.3","spread":"0.54"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.4","spread":"0.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.0","spread":"0.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.1","spread":"0.26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.0","spread":"0.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.3","spread":"0.46"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.3","spread":"0.50"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.3","spread":"0.51"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.7","spread":"0.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.7","spread":"0.59"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.8","spread":"0.55"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.1","spread":"0.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.1","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.1","spread":"0.26"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"European Quality of Life-5 Dimension-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L): Overall Health Utility Score/ Index Value","description":"EQ-5D health state profile has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.
