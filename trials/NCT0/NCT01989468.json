Two overall summary scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) can be computed. In this study, SF-36 PCS is used to assess improvement from baseline of at least one dose of secukinumab versus placebo. The SF-36 is a validated instrument measuring health-related quality of life across multiple disease states. It has 36 questions with 8 subscale scores and 2 summary scores (1) physical component summary=physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. There is no total overall score; scoring is done for both subscores and summary scores. For subscores and summary scores, 0 =worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score.

It has 4 dimensions: disability, pain, drug side effects and dollar costs. In this trial, only the disability dimension was used. The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing 8 common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories: 0 (without any difficulty), 1 (with some difficulty), 2 (with much difficulty) and 3 (unable to do). Within each of the 8 categories, only the item indicating the most severe impairment contributes to the category score. The HAQ score is calculated by summing the computed scores for each category and dividing by the number of categories answered. It ranges from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.27","spread":"0.043"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.38","spread":"0.042"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.17","spread":"0.055"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Patients With Dactylitis at Week 24 in the Subset of Patients Who Had Dactylitis at Baseline","description":"The presence of dactylitis was assessed by dactylitis count (number of fingers and toes with dactylitis, with a range of 0-20).
