After an overnight fast, subjects ingested a solution consisting of 50 grams of glucose mixed in 150 mL of water. Immediately before ingestion of glucose and at 20-minute intervals for 2 hours following ingestion, laboratory staff collected end-expiratory breath samples and analyzed them for hydrogen and methane using a Quintron sample correction (SC) breath microlyzer. A diagnosis of SBBO was defined by an increase in expiration of 12 parts per million (ppm) or more of hydrogen and/or methane.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"PD-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39)","description":"The PDQ-39 is designed to address aspects of functioning and well-being for those affected by Parkinson's disease.
