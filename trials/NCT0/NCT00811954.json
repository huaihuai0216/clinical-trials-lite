The most commonly prescribed and successful regimen contains the medication efavirenz (EFV). However, this regimen may not be an option for everyone, hence alternative regimens are needed.\n\nThis study was designed to look at how well different combinations of anti-HIV drugs work to decrease the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) of and allow immune system recovery in people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. This study also examined drug tolerability and safety for the various drug combinations.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cumulative Probability of First Virologic Failure by Week 96","timeFrame":"From study entry to week 96","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: ATV/RTV + FTC/TDF","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: RAL + FTC/TDF","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C: DRV/RTV + FTC/TDF","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":57,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17720662","18641035","17721395","18722869","35179037","33901188","33870433","26797215","25904376","25767256","25285539"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":139,"n":605},"commonTop":["Blood cholesterol increased","Low density lipoprotein increased","Blood bilirubin increased","Blood glucose increased","Blood creatinine increased"]}}
