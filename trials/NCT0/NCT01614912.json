The measure is comprised of 30 items and three subscales: the Positive subscale contains seven questions to assess delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinations behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility; the Negative subscale contains seven questions to assess blunted effect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and the General Psychopathology subscale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern, and disorientation. An anchored Likert scale from 1-7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms, is used to score each item. The PANSS total score is the sum of all 30 items and ranges from 30 through 210. A higher score is associated with greater illness severity.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-28.4","spread":"22.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Score at LOCF Endpoint","description":"CGI-S is a clinician-rated assessment of the participant's current disease state on a 7-point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater severity of the disease.\n\nBaseline in the prior study (D1001056, double-blind \\[DB\\] baseline) was defined as baseline of the prior study.
