In previously performed clinical trials, some patients treated with intravitreal microplasmin have had resolution of their underlying condition, including macular hole closure, without need for vitrectomy. This clinical trial is justified because the sponsor believes the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Subjects With Nonsurgical Resolution of Focal Vitreomacular Adhesion at Day 28","timeFrame":"Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ocriplasmin 125µg","deltaMin":25.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Czechia","Germany","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26068086","23033391","22894573","22879421"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":245},"commonTop":["Vitreous floaters","Conjuctival haemorrahge","Eye pain","Photopsia","Vision blurred"]}}
