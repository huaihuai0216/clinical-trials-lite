Participants must be on optimal therapy for their angina and must have been on a stable anti-anginal medication regimen for at least 4 weeks before signing the informed consent form.\n* Participants with obstructive coronary disease unsuitable for conventional revascularization due to unsuitable anatomy or comorbidity as determined at the site and confirmed by an independent adjudication committee.\n* Participants must have evidence of inducible myocardial ischemia.\n* Participants must experience angina episodes.\n* Participants must be able to complete 2 exercise tolerance tests on the treadmill within 3 weeks of randomization.\n* If female of childbearing potential, subject must not be pregnant and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study.\n\nMain Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cardiovascular hospitalization within 60 days prior to potential study enrollment. Participant has had a successful or partially successful coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) within 6 months or PCTA within 60 days of potential study enrollment.\n* Participant has had a placement of a bi-ventricular pacemaker for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure within 180 days of potential study enrollment.\n* Participant has documented stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) within 60 days of potential study enrollment.\n* Participant has a history of moderate to severe aortic stenosis; or severe aortic insufficiency; or severe mitral stenosis; or severe mitral insufficiency.\n* Participant has a prosthetic aortic valve or a mechanical mitral valve replacement.\n* Participant has severe co-morbidity associated with a reduction in life expectancy to less than 3 years as a result of chronic medical illnesses.\n* Participants with cancer are excluded with the following exceptions:\n\n  * Subjects with in-situ non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical cancer are not excluded.\n  * Participants that have been cancer free for \\>= 5 years as determined by their oncologist are not excluded. Subjects with a prior history of stem cell transplant for cancer are excluded no matter how long they have been cancer-free.\n* Participants with a history of leukemia or other bone marrow disease.\n* Participant has sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait.\n* Participants with proliferative retinopathy.\n* Participants with Hb A1c \\> 9%.\n* Participant has platelet counts \\>10% above the upper limit of normal (ULN) or platelet counts \\< 70,000.\n* Participant has a hematocrit \\< 30% prior to potential study enrollment.\n* Participant has a serum creatinine \\> 2.5 mg/dL prior to potential study enrollment.\n* Participant tests positive for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, or is on chronic immunosuppressive medications, or has had a previous stem cell transplant.\n* Participant has a known contraindication to Neupogen (filgrastim) or G-CSF.\n* Participant was previously enrolled in an active treatment group of cell therapy trials for cardiovascular disease including any phase of CD34+ stem cell trials.\n* Left ventricular (LV) thickness of \\< 7 mm in the target areas of injection as measured by during a 2-D echocardiogram (ECHO).\n* Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or other uncontrolled arrhythmias that would prohibit accurate electromechanical mapping and NOGA-guided intramyocardial injection.\n* Bleeding diathesis with an INR \\> 1.8 when not receiving anti-thrombotic therapy.\n* Hepatic dysfunction as evidenced by elevated AST or ALT levels \\> 2.5 x ULN.\n* Any previous transplant requiring immunosuppression.\n* Disease state requiring chronic immunosuppression.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","maximumAge":"80
