This outcome measure assessed the long-term persistence of antibody response. Seroconversion to HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 were defined as a titer \\>=41, 24, 34, 39, 24, 18, 12, 16, and 12 mMU/mL, respectively. These cutoffs differ from analyses performed on samples collected up to Month 13; the antibody persistence analysis employed a new version of the assay.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"99.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"97.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"92.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"92.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"99.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"98.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"92.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"97.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"100","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"99.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"98.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"94.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"97.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"97.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"90.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"96.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"97.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"86.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"96.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"99.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"98.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"91.9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"83.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"81.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"87.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"91.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"77.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"93.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"93.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"98.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"97.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"95.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"99.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"100","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"98.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"94.8","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":294},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Headache"]}}}
