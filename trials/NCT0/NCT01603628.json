The resistance encountered to passive stretch was graded using a 6-point scale where: 0=no increase in muscle tone (best) to 4=affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension (worst). For analysis purposes, the MAS-B was recoded as follows: 0=1, 1=1, 1+=2, 2=3, 3=4, 4=5. The scores at Weeks 4 and 6 were averaged. A Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) model was used for analysis.

The MTS of the ankle was used to determine the passive range of movement at different movement velocities, V1 (as slow as possible) and V3 (as fast as possible) with the relative difference between a slow and fast velocity passive stretch determining the dynamic component of the muscle contracture for the joint. The investigator measured 2 joint angles by goniometer: the R1 angle which is the angle of catch after a fast velocity (V3) stretch and the R2 angle defined as the passive joint range of movement following a slow velocity (V1) stretch. The R2-R1 value indicated the level of the dynamic component of spasticity in the joint. The difference between R2 and R1 range of motion and respective change from baseline to each posttreatment office visit on the MTS was derived.
