During the early phase the pain is usually unbearable and the later restriction in movement is severely limiting. It occurs when the flexible tissue (capsule) that surrounds the shoulder joint becomes inflamed, thickened and tight. The pain can be very severe and lasts 3-9 months, followed by a 4-12 month period of increasing stiffness, after which the condition usually improves. Frozen shoulder often affects a person's ability to sleep, carry out everyday activities, and work. Current treatments include rest, painkillers, anti-inflammatories, physiotherapy and steroid injections. If stiffness persists, surgery is sometimes recommended. However, there is no evidence that any of these treatments lead to significant benefit in the long term, with many being ineffective. The aim of this study is to find out if it is possible to run a larger trial to test whether an injection of adalimumab can reduce pain and prevent the disease from getting worse, if given during the early painful phase of frozen shoulder. The investigators need to conduct this smaller study first to be sure it's possible to identify and treat people with early stage frozen shoulder, before they conduct a much larger trial to find out if this treatment works.\n\nIn this study the investigators will include 84 adults from 5 sites with painful early stage frozen shoulder who have not yet received treatment. People will be randomised to receive either an injection of the drug adalimumab or a dummy injection of saline (placebo) directly into the shoulder joint, both guided by ultrasound. All participants will also receive standardized advice on how to manage their shoulder pain. The investigators will assess participants before treatment and three months later. Adalimumab has been used very successfully to treat other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. This study has been funded by the NIHR RfPB programme and 180 Life Sciences.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Eligible With Pain Predominant Frozen Shoulder","timeFrame":"3 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All Screened Participants","deltaMin":39,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37881307","38692727"],"seeAlso":["http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/5/e078273.long","http://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/articles/2-28"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":4},"commonTop":[]}}
