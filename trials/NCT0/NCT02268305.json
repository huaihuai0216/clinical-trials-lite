Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 will take by mouth 6000 milligrams (mgs) of MSM plus standard of care naproxen. Group 2 will take by mouth placebo capsules plus standard of care naproxen. Subjects will be instructed to take their study pills for 12 weeks and record on a study diary. They will then be followed up for one final visit 4 weeks later. RMDQ, PIQ-6, pain level, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC) will be assessed at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks. Subjects' participation will last 16 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Level","timeFrame":"16 weeks (Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MSM 1000mg Twice a Day (6000 Mgs)","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":1.5},{"arm":"Placebo Capsules Twice a Day","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["musculoskeletal pain","colitis"]}}
