In addition, it must be either high voltage (above 300 ÂµV) or have electrodecrement/discontinuity.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant is currently taking or has taken clobazam or any mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor within the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit.\n* Participant has a QT interval, corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula (QTcB), of 460 msec or greater on ECG.\n* Participant's caregiver is currently giving or has given recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-based medications, within the 1 month prior to the screening visit.\n* Participant's caregiver is unwilling to abstain from giving the participant (including the participant's mother abstaining themselves, if breastfeeding)recreational or medicinal cannabis, or synthetic cannabinoid-based medications (other than the study drug) during the trial.\n* Participant has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the study drug, such as sesame oil.\n* Participant has significantly impaired hepatic function at the screening visit.\n* Participant has received an investigational medicinal product as part of a clinical trial within a minimum of 5 half-lives prior to the screening visit.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Month","maximumAge":"24
