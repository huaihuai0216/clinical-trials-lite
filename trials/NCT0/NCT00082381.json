This criterion includes drugs that have not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.\n* Patients have had greater than three episodes of severe hypoglycemia within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Patients are undergoing therapy for a malignancy, other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer.\n* Patients have cardiac disease that is Class III or IV, according to the New York Heart Association criteria.\n* Patients have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to insulin glargine, AC2993, or excipients contained in these agents.\n* Patients have characteristics contraindicating metformin or sulfonylurea use, according to product-specific label, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Patients have a history of renal transplantation or are currently receiving renal dialysis or have serum creatinine \\>=1.5 mg/dL for males and \\>=1.3 mg/dL for females.\n* Patients have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease, acute or chronic hepatitis, or alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range.\n* Patients have known hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia.\n* Patients are receiving chronic (lasting longer than 2 weeks) systemic glucocorticoid therapy (excluding topical and inhaled preparations) or have received such therapy within 2 weeks immediately prior to screening.\n* Patients have used any prescription drug to promote weight loss within 3 months prior to screening.\n* Patients have any other condition (including known drug or alcohol abuse or psychiatric disorder) that precludes them from following and completing the protocol, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Patients fail to satisfy the investigator of suitability to participate for any other reason.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"75
