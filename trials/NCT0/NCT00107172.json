Surgery may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether surgery and internal radiation therapy are more effective than surgery alone in treating non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Local Recurrence","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (SR)","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (SR + BX)","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.98"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17909906","21872277","21724195","24982457","25500100"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":114},"commonTop":["Dyspnea","Pneumonia","Hypoxia","Postoperative hemorrhage","Thrombosis"]}}
