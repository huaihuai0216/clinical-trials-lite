Prior to taking the study drug each morning, the participant selected the number that best described his or her pain over the past 24 hours on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Higher ADPS scores indicated worse outcome. ADPS was the weekly average pain score based on the pain scores from the electronic patient diaries (Pain diary).\n\nIn this outcome, the change from baseline in ADPS is being reported with negative values representing improvements in average daily pain. The larger the negative value (ie. improvement), the greater the improvement in average daily pain.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.14","spread":"0.680"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.20","spread":"0.217"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.37","spread":"0.940"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.50","spread":"0.937"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.85","spread":"1.294"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.83","spread":"1.859"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.13","spread":"1.318"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.07","spread":"2.375"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.90","spread":"1.361"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.89","spread":"2.278"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.92","spread":"1.285"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.82","spread":"1.922"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.22","spread":"1.402"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.93","spread":"1.732"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.29","spread":"1.554"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.04","spread":"1.735"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.36","spread":"1.540"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.21","spread":"1.980"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.33","spread":"1.562"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.32","spread":"1.914"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.43","spread":"1.664"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.07","spread":"1.584"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.59","spread":"1.636"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.10","spread":"1.728"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.84","spread":"1.650"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.25","spread":"1.700"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.90","spread":"1.697"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.52","spread":"2.026"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":30},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Somnolence","Oedema peripheral","Dizziness","Sensory disturbance"]}}}
