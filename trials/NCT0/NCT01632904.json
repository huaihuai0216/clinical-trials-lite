Using the diary, patients rated the following symptoms on a scale from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable): tiredness, itching, muscle aches, night sweats, and sweats while awake. The total symptom score ranged from 0-50 and was calculated as the sum of the 5 symptom scores. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects Achieving ≥ 50% Improvement From Baseline in the Individual Symptom Scores for TSS-C at Week 16","description":"The TSS-C cluster includes tiredness, itching, muscle aches, night sweats, and sweats while awake.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"47.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"41.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Subjects Randomized to Ruxolitinib Who Achieved ≥ 50% Improvement From Baseline in Total Symptom Score-Cytokine and the Individual Symptom Scores at Week 16 That Were Maintained at Week 48","description":"Durable Response on TSS-C/individual symptoms defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in TSS-C/individual symptoms at Week 16 that were maintained at Week 48","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31.5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37.0","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":54},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Diarrhea","Anemia","Headache","Dizziness"]}}}
