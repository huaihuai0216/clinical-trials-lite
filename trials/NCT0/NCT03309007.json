LC3-II is a widely used marker to monitor autophagosome formation by quantitation of the number of LC3-labeled puncta (autophagosomes, or \"dots\") per cell detected by fluorescence microscopy. An increase in LC3 puncta formation denotes an increase in autophagic activity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"3.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.8","spread":"3.0"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":["Diarrhea"]}}}
