Segmental evaluation of colon cleansing scores is as follows: 4: Colon empty and clean, no remaining stool or liquid. 3: Presence of clear liquid in the gut which can be removed by suction. 2: Brown liquid or semisolid remaining amounts of stool, fully removable. 1: Semisolid amounts of stool, only partially removable, difficult to make colonoscopy; 0: Irremovable, heavy, hard stools, colonoscopy impossible. Success of cleansing was defined as Grades of bowel cleansing А and В.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.29","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.43","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Patient Satisfaction of Colonoscopy Preparation (VAS)","description":"Patient satisfaction was measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) where 0 (left end of the line) is marked as \"totally unacceptable\" (lowest patient satisfaction of colonoscopy preparation) and 100 is \"fully acceptable\" (highest patient satisfaction with the procedure).
