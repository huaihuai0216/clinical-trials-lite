Previous studies have utilized a phone-based bionic pancreas. The iLet consists of a touchscreen-enabled, menu-driven user interface and an onboard microprocessor that provides a comprehensive and standalone platform, which allows the iLet to operate independently of smartphones or other devices and without the need for internet support during routine operation.\n\nThis is a multicenter study of adult participants with type 1 diabetes, who will manage their diabetes with the iLet bionic pancreas compared to usual care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean CGM Glucose","timeFrame":"Days 3-7 for the RCT Period","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care Arm","deltaMin":144.3,"sd":9.5},{"arm":"iLet With Insulin Analogue (Novolog/Humalog) Arm","deltaMin":162,"sd":26},{"arm":"iLet Using Fiasp Arm","deltaMin":155,"sd":12}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":36},"commonTop":["Non-serious adverse event","Non serious adverse event","Non-serious adverse event"]}}
