The component scores include questions on subjective sleep quality, sleep latency (i.e., how long it takes to fall asleep), sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency (i.e., the percentage of time in bed that one is asleep), sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction.\n\nEach component score of the PSQI ranges from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating the greatest dysfunction or disturbance to sleep. The seven component scores are then summed to obtain a global PSQI score, which ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate poorer sleep quality, with a score greater than 5 suggesting significant sleep difficulties","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.1","spread":"0.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.7","spread":"0.5"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":"0.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.5","spread":"0.5"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.1","spread":"0.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.2","spread":"0.5"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events - Week 48 to Week 96","description":"Adverse Events reports (AEs, SAEs and treatment discontinuation)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in CD4","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-31.7","spread":"34.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.2","spread":"51"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27.3","spread":"36.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-9.8","spread":"55.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.4","spread":"47.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.7","spread":"71.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in CD8 Cell Count","description":"Change from baseline to week 48, Change from week 48 to week 96;
