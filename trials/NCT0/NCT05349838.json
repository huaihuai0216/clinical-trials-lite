The same is true for subjects who need to start antiretroviral therapy and have acquired virus that is already resistant to antiretrovirals. These \"second line\" combinations are often associated with numerous issues that can have a potential impact on the quality of life (QoL) of these patients. Therefore a simpler and better tolerated alternative second line treatment option would be a useful tool for the clinical management of these patients.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of a dual combined therapy of Dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg Once Daily (OD) + Rilpivirine (RPV) 25 mg OD in virologically suppressed participants with previous virological failure with NNRTIs and having the clinically significant mutation K103N. The secondary objective of the study is to assess whether a simplification of the treatment in terms of pill burden, long term metabolic toxicity and potential for drug interactions improves the QOL of the participants. The study will also evaluate DTG \\& RPV concentrations in the blood plus changes in cell associated virus.\n\nIn order to compare the first line treatment (boosted PI and/or other antiretroviral combinations) and the DTG+RPV combination, two thirds of study participants will be switched to DTG+RPV immediately and receive DTG+RPV for 96 weeks. The other third will be switched after 48 weeks of continuing on their first line treatment and receive DTG+RPV for 48 weeks. All participants will then be followed up for a further 30 days. Participants will be recruited from sites across Europe, and randomised onto either arm of the study. After randomisation, participants will attend approximately 10 visits over the course of two years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With and Without Virological Suppression","timeFrame":"48 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG/RPV FDC Regimen","deltaMin":84,"sd":null},{"arm":"Continued ART Regimen","deltaMin":40,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["Belgium","France","Germany","Italy","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38417976"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":95},"commonTop":["headache","COVID-19","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Insomnia"]}}
