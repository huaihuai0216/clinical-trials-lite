Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 study treatments; systemic antibiotic therapy and standard ulcer care with either (A) daily application of a gentamicin-sponge, (B) daily application of a placebo-sponge or (C) no-sponge, in the ratio 2:1:1. Patients will be treated for approximately 28 days and return to the clinic weekly for safety and efficacy assessments. After completing treatment, patients will return to the clinic for scheduled follow-up visits approximately 10, 30, 60 and 90 days after treatment is stopped.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent of Patients With a Clinical Outcome of Clinical Cure (Resolution of All Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Infection)","timeFrame":"approximately 10 days after end of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gentamicin Sponge Group","deltaMin":69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Sponge Group","deltaMin":41,"sd":null},{"arm":"No Sponge Group","deltaMin":36,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Czechia","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":42,"n":260},"commonTop":["infected skin ulcer","skin ulcer","skin ulcer","diarrhoea","Nausea"]}}
