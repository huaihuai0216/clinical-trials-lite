The HOPS study will compare bone loss at 12 months in women: 1) who take calcium and vitamin D only; 2) who take calcium and vitamin D plus the medication \"risedronate\"; or 3) who take calcium and vitamin D plus participate in bone-loading exercises. Our central hypothesis is that improvements in bone health will be greater in women randomized to bone-loading exercises with calcium and vitamin D compared to women who take calcium and vitamin D only or women who take calcium and vitamin D plus risedronate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Bone Strength Index of the Distal Tibia Based on Randomization to Control, Risedronate, or Exercise Group.","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6, and 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":2098.7,"sd":334.7},{"arm":"Risedronate","deltaMin":1993.3,"sd":292.3},{"arm":"Exercise","deltaMin":2001,"sd":332.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.7"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19252142","12919708","17768587","18382907","16283062","1874931","18035193","17140871","19802506","10843171","12844212","12471325","19262975","17724395","23208074","20148064","19113923","15119056","16825677","15886381","15758064","16405362","12464707","17521506","17499038","17521505","19335674","20061894","17031008","15050906","21779818","21694556","17291843","22581292","34519832","27576310"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":93},"commonTop":["Constipation","muscle or joint pain","Gi disturbances","Chest Pain or Dizziness"]}}
