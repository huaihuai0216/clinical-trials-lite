Assessments were done by 3 independent readers. H/M ratios were categorized as 'Low' and 'High' based on being \\<1.6 or ≥1.6 respectively. The efficacy of 123I-mIBG was based on the prognostic value of the imaging data collected relative to time to adverse cardiac events.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":532},"commonTop":[]}}}
