Participants who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures, including daily completion of the e diary for 7 days after each study vaccination.\n3. Healthy participants who are determined by medical history, physical examination and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study.\n4. Capable of giving signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that may contraindicate IM injection.\n2. History of severe adverse reaction associated with a vaccine and/or severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any component of the study intervention or any related vaccine.\n3. Allergy to egg proteins (egg or egg products) or chicken proteins.\n4. History of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n5. Serious chronic disorder, including metastatic malignancy, end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, excludes the participant from participating in the study.\n6. Immunocompromised individuals with known or suspected immunodeficiency, as determined by history and/or laboratory/physical examination.\n7. Other medical or psychiatric condition, including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study.\n8.

Individuals who receive chronic treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, including cytotoxic agents, monoclonal antibodies, systemic corticosteroids, or radiotherapy, eg, for cancer or an autoimmune disease, from 60 days before study intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study. If systemic corticosteroids (\\<20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) have been administered short term (\\<14 days) for treatment of an acute illness, participants should not be enrolled in the study until corticosteroid therapy has been discontinued for at least 28 days before study intervention administration.
