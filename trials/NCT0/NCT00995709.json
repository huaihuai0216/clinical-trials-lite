To determine the prednisone equivalent dose, the corticosteroid dose was multiplied by a conversion factor. . The total prednisone equivalent dose was calculated as the sum of the prednisone equivalent doses of all corticosteroids. Consequently, the total converted prednisone equivalent dose was used to obtain the immunosuppressive score. The key secondary efficacy variable was the change in total post-baseline immunosuppressive medication score from baseline.The score is actually the prednisoone equivalents taken by patient as calculated by conversion table. A reduction in prenisone or prenisone equivalents is a positive outcome. An increase in the number of prednisone equivalents suggests that the treatment is not efficacious or that there is disease progression. A score of 0 would be the lowest ( no steriods taken) and the upper limit is indeterminate.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.769","spread":"4.306"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.11","spread":"5.3236"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.231","spread":"3.8064"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.441","spread":"4.4641"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.09","spread":"5.3331"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"8.722","spread":"3.2027"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.769","spread":"4.3036"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.11","spread":"5.3236"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.231","spread":"3.8064"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"To Determine the Effect of AIN457 on Macular Edema and Visual Acuity in Patients With Posterior Segment Uveitis Secondary to Behçet's Disease as Determined by Optical Coherence Tomography.","description":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is amedical imaging technique that uses light to capture micrometer-resolution, three-dimensional images from within optical scattering media (e.g., biological tissue). OCT is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light. The use of relatively long wavelength light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. OCT is a noninvasive procedure that uses optical interferometry to visualize the structures within the retina. Following dilation of the pupil, a light source operating at 850nm provides probe illumination which is split and detected with and without the refraction of the retinal tissues. Cross-sectional imaging is accomplished in 1.3 second by acquiring a sequence of interferometric A-scans. A false color tomogram of optical reflectivity is produced by the computer. Central foveal thickness will be the primary variable derived from OCT. A increase in thickness could translate to disease progression.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-26.5","spread":"131.32"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.6","spread":"75.29"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-49.4","spread":"174.25"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"To Establish the Impact of AIN457 on Quality of Life of Posterior Segment Uveitis Patients Secondary to Behçet's Disease Refractory to Systemic Immunomodulatory Therapy as Measured by National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionaire-25 and Euroqol.","description":"The VFQ-25 is a reliable and valid 25-item version of the 51-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ).
