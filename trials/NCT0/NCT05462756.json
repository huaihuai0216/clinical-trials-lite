The study consists of a 3-week screening/lead-in period, a 26-week treatment period and a 5-week safety follow-up period. The study will last up to 34 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [Noninferiority]","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"500 U/mL - Insulin Efsitora","deltaMin":-1.01,"sd":0.0463},{"arm":"100 U/mL - Insulin Glargine","deltaMin":-1,"sd":0.0463}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":81,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Germany","India","Italy","Mexico","Puerto Rico","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40562048"],"seeAlso":["https://trials.lilly.com/en-US/trial/350915"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":365},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Influenza"]}}
