and patient\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* No prior intervention for submental fat (SMF) (eg liposuction, surgery or lipolytic agents)\n* Absence of clinically significant health problems\n* Anatomical features for which reduction in SMF may result in aesthetically unacceptable outcome, judged by clinician\n* History of trauma associated with the chin or neck areas that in the judgment of the
