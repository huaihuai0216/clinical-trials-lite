Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of \\[cancer/tumor\\] cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. External radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and external and internal radiation therapy together with carboplatin and paclitaxel kills more tumor cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival Rate at 5 Years","timeFrame":"5 years from study randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard Chemoradiation","deltaMin":71,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Chemoradiation With Adjuvant Chemotherapy","deltaMin":72,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":326,"countries":["United States","Canada","China","Saudi Arabia","Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37080223","34201380"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":98,"n":453},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Diarrhea","Lymphocyte count decreased","Anemia"]}}
