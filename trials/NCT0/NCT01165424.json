This is a multi-center, open-label study of MFNS in children with perennial allergic rhinitis. MFNS will be administered to pediatric subjects (3-15 years old) with perennial allergic rhinitis at a dose of 100 to 200 μg/day (once daily) for 12 weeks. Subjects (subject's legal representatives) provided consent to continue treatment beyond 12 weeks will receive treatment for up to 24 weeks. At each clinic visit, observation of adverse events, nasal symptom scores, and nasal findings will be evaluated. The presence/absence of serious adverse events and trial procedure-related AEs will be reviewed 30 days after the end of the follow-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Adverse Drug Reactions","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MFNS","deltaMin":76,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":80},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Blood cortisol decreased","Epistaxis","Pyrexia","Pharyngitis"]}}
