Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will complete a 7 to14 day run-in period followed by a randomization visit (Visit 2) then a 24-week treatment period. There will be a total of 9 clinic study visits. A follow-up phone contact for adverse event assessment will be conducted approximately one week after the last study visit (Visit 9 or Early Withdrawal). The total duration of subject participation in the study will be approximately 27 weeks. A subset of subjects at selected sites will also perform 24-hour serial spirometry and Holter monitoring during the study and provide serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis. Sparse pharmacokinetic sampling for population pharmacokinetic analyses will be obtained from non-subset subjects. The primary measure of efficacy is clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 on Treatment Day 169. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and 24 hour Holter monitoring (subset only).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 169 (Week 24)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 169","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.031,"sd":0.0153},{"arm":"UMEC 125 µg","deltaMin":0.129,"sd":0.0119},{"arm":"VI 25 µg","deltaMin":0.093,"sd":0.0121},{"arm":"UMEC/VI 125/25 µg","deltaMin":0.207,"sd":0.0119}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":157,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Denmark","Estonia","France","Germany","Hungary","Japan","Netherlands","Norway","Philippines","Slovakia","Sweden","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24385182"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":275},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Cough","Back pain","Pyrexia"]}}
