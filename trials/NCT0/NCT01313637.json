The daily score is computed as the mean of the scores on the 13 items (\\>=7 items must have non-missing responses for this to be calculated). The par. is assigned a weekly mean SOBDA score ranging from 1 to 4 (greater scores indicate more severe breathlessness with daily activities) based on the mean of 7 days of data (\\>=4 of 7 days must be completed for a weekly mean to be calculated). Change from BL is the mean weekly SOBDA score minus BL.
