Subjects will be screened within 2 weeks prior to study entry to establish eligibility. Subjects who meet all the selection criteria will be randomly assigned 1:1 to (1) once-a-week, subcutaneous Pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIntron) (1.5 mcg/kg body weight) or (2) oral adefovir 10 mg daily. The treatment phase will be 24 weeks for PegIntron and 48 weeks for adefovir. All subjects completing the assigned treatment phase will be followed up for an additional 48 weeks for PegIntron and 24 weeks for adefovir as observation phase. The primary objective is to establish the efficacy profile of PegIntron. Secondary objectives are to compare the efficacy profile of PegIntron with that of adefovir, compare efficacy of PegIntron in lamivudine-na√Øve and lamivudine-experienced subjects, and to establish the safety profile of PegIntron in treating patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Combined Response Consisting of All Three Responses - (a) Serological Response, (b) Virological Response, and (c) Biochemical Response","timeFrame":"At Week 72 [for Pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIntron), at 48 weeks post PegIntron treatment for up to 24 weeks; for Adefovir, at 24 weeks post adefovir treatment for up to 48 weeks]","effectByArm":[{"arm":"PegIntron","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adefovir","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":13},"commonTop":["PYREXIA","ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE INCREASED","LEUKOPENIA","NAUSEA","HEADACHE"]}}
