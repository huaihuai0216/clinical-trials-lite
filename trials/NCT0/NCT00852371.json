The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of different combination antimalarial regimens, including amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), and placebo, to SP for intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) in schoolchildren, as measured by risk of parasitaemia (unadjusted by genotyping) after 42 days of follow-up. This will assess both the efficacy for treatment of asymptomatic infections and the efficacy for prevention of new infections.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Risk of Parasitaemia (Unadjusted by Genotyping)","timeFrame":"after 42 days of follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine","deltaMin":23,"sd":null},{"arm":"Combination of Amodiaquine +Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine","deltaMin":87,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":164,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Alone","deltaMin":147,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["20976051"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":198},"commonTop":["Headache","Cough","Nausea","Fever"]}}
