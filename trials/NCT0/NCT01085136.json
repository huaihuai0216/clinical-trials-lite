Patients on both treatment arms will receive best supportive care in addition to study treatment. Patients enrolled into the trial will be treated and followed until death or lost to follow-up. Additional information on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be collected.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (Part B)","timeFrame":"From randomization until disease progression or death; Up to 32 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Afatinib Plus Paclitaxel (Part B)","deltaMin":5.55,"sd":null},{"arm":"Investigators Choice of Chemotherapy (Part B)","deltaMin":2.89,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0030"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":97,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","China","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26646759"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":471,"n":1154},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Rash","Paronychia","Decreased appetite","Stomatitis"]}}
