The donor cornea to be used for EK will be provided by an eye bank and will have been stored in either an Optisol GS solution or a Life 4°C solution. At 6 months, the doctors will determine whether there are any comparable differences in cell loss and graft clarity between the two donor corneas.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Endothelial Cell Loss Post EK for Donor Corneas Preserved in Life 4°C and Optisol GS Corneal Storage Media","timeFrame":"Six months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Optisol GS","deltaMin":20,"sd":20},{"arm":"Life 4C","deltaMin":18,"sd":18}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25625366"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":[]}}
