Joint erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) were assessed by two independent, blinded readers.\n\nJoint erosion was assessed in 16 joints in each hand/wrist and 6 joints in each foot. Each joint was scored from 0 (no erosion) to 5 for hands/wrists or to 10 for feet (complete collapse). The total erosion score ranges from 0 to 280 (worst).\n\nJSN was assessed in 15 joints of each hand and wrist, and 6 joints of each foot, including subluxation, from 0 (normal) to 4 (complete loss of joint space, bony ankylosis, or luxation). The total JSN score ranges from 0 to 168 (worst).\n\nThe mTSS is the sum of the joint erosion and JSN scores and ranges from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst). A change from Baseline greater than 0 indicates progression.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.64","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.95","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.19","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With No Radiographic Progression at Week 24 - Japan Sub-study","description":"No radiographic progression is defined as a change from Baseline in mTSS ≤ 0.
