Absence of pregnancy should be verified with a urine pregnancy test.\n* Subject must be of non-childbearing potential, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or lactating female. Enrolment should be deferred until three months after pregnancy has been completed or after lactating has ceased.\n* A woman planning to become pregnant or likely to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive prevention during the study period and up to two months after the last vaccine dose.\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period and the extended safety follow-up period.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Previous vaccination against HPV or planned administration of another HPV vaccine during the study other than that foreseen by protocol.\n* Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days (i.e. Day 0-29) of each dose of vaccine. Administration of routine meningococcal, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, inactivated influenza, diphtheria/tetanus and/or diphtheria/tetanus-containing vaccine up to 8 days before each dose of study vaccine is allowed. Enrolment will be deferred until the subject is outside of specified window.\n* Previous administration of components of the investigational vaccine.\n* History of allergic disease, suspected allergy or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the study vaccine.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, haematological, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by previous physical examination or laboratory tests, which in the opinion of the investigator precludes administration of the study vaccine.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* Cancer or autoimmune disease under treatment.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"26 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","description":"SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity.\n\nNote: Results from one center where compliance issues were discovered are presented also separately.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Medically Significant Conditions (MSCs)","description":"MSCs include adverse events prompting emergency room or physician visits that are not related to common diseases or routine visits for physical examination or vaccination, or serious adverse events (SAEs) that are not related to common diseases.
