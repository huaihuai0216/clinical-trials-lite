Specific attention should be given to the compliance potential of subjects with suspected or known drug or alcohol abuse.\n* A man or woman 65 years of age or older at the time of vaccination.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject.\n* Free of an acute aggravation of the health status as established by clinical evaluation before entering into the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any confirmed or suspected influenza illness within the last 6 months.\n* Previous vaccination against influenza with any seasonal vaccine since December 2008.\n* Planned administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccines during the entire study period.\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Administration of other licensed vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines) or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrolment in this study. Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol up to Visit 2.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone \\>= 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s) including egg and chicken protein, included history of hypersensitivity to a previous dose of influenza vaccine.\n* Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature \\>= 37.5°C on oral setting.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Any medical conditions in which intramuscular injections are contraindicated.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Serum Haemagglutination-Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titers Against the 3 Vaccine Strains","description":"Titers are presented as Geometric Mean Titers.
