The participant will either get semaglutide (active medicine) or placebo (\"dummy\" medicine). Which treatment the participants get is decided by chance. The participant's chance of getting semaglutide or placebo is the same. The participant will get the study medicine in a pen. The participants will need to use the pen to inject the study medicine in a skinfold once a week. The study will last for about 2.5 to 5 years. Participants will have up to 25 clinic visits with the study doctor.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants From Time of Randomization to First Occurrence of a Composite Outcome Measure Consisting of: Cardiovascular (CV) Death, Non-fatal Myocardial Infarction (MI), or Non-fatal Stroke","timeFrame":"From randomisation (week 0) up to 240 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Semaglutide","deltaMin":569,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":701,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":833,"countries":["United States","Algeria","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Latvia","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Serbia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32916609","33567185","37952131","40156748","39882599","39608381","39480988","39222642","39217559","39181597","38796653","38740993","36738088","35373878","35175229","34693515"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2941,"n":8803},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Nausea","Diarrhoea","Constipation","Decreased appetite"]}}
