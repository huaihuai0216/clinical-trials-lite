Mild to moderate tinea pedis (athlete's foot) infection should be treated with terbinafine prior to baseline or at any time during the trial. Other topical treatments for athlete's foot may be recommended at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Subjects must not have abnormalities of the nail that could prevent a normal appearing nail if clearing of infection is achieved\n* No administration of systemic antifungal medications within 6 months prior to screening visit\n* No application of prescription topical antifungal medications for toenail fungus within 3 months or other commercially available topical medications for toenail fungus applied directly to the toenails within 1 month prior to screening visit\n* Patients with the target toenail involving the matrix (lunula) or having less than 2mm clear (unaffected) nail plate length beyond the proximal fold.\n* Presence of dermatophytoma (defined as thick masses of fungal hyphae and necrotic keratin between the nail plate and nail bed) on the target nail.\n* No professional pedicures or application of any nail polish product or nail cosmetic to the toenails after the screening visit\n* Known pregnancy or lactation at time of enrollment\n\nOther protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Complete Cure at the End of Study After Treating Participants for 48 Weeks","description":"Complete cure is defined as negative potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy and negative culture for dermatophytes and no residual involvement of the target toenail.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.18","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.96","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Clinical Effectiveness at the End of Study After Treating Patients for 48 Weeks.","description":"Clinical effectiveness is defined as negative KOH microscopy and negative culture for dermatophytes and \\<= 10% residual involvement of the target toenail.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.54","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.83","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Mycological Cure at End of Study After Treating Patients for 48 Weeks","description":"Mycological cure is defined as negative KOH microscopy and negative culture for dermatophytes","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.71","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Safety and Tolerability Assessed by the Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"Safety and tolerability data as assessed by the number of participants with Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events, Drug discontinuation due to an AE or SAE and death.
