This study will help determine the efficacy of the two techniques and their advantages when compared to each other including time to perform the block, opioid consumption reduction, effects on postoperative pain, and the length of stay.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Time to Perform the Regional Anesthesia Technique","timeFrame":"Baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block (FICB)","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lumbar Plexus Block (LPB)","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":8},"commonTop":[]}}
