This is a multicenter study in which subjects will be randomized to receive treatment 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Subjects who complete 6 weeks of double-blind treatment may be eligible to receive up to four weeks of open label sTMS therapy or antidepressant medications during the follow-up phase of the study. Follow-up evaluation visits will be conducted during those four weeks, with the frequency of the visits determined by the treatment choice during that timeframe.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean HAM-D17 Total Score Change (Intent to Treat - All)","timeFrame":"Baseline to End of Double-Blind Treatment Period (Week 6)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active sTMS","deltaMin":-7.49,"sd":7.25},{"arm":"Sham","deltaMin":-6.97,"sd":6.28}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"22 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":18,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26143022"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":103},"commonTop":["Headache","Back Pain","Insomnia","Respiratory Infection","Non-Specific GI Discomfort"]}}
