The investigators have recently completed preliminary open-label studies with FEAST, first at Columbia University, and then at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston (Nahas et al., 2013b). The investigators have published the outcomes of the first 17 patients studied. One patient withdrew from the study after a single titration session. After the course of FEAST (median 10 sessions), there was a 46.1 + 35.5% improvement in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD24) scores compared to baseline (33.1 + 6.8, 16.8 + 10.9; P \\< 0.0001). Eight of 16 patients met response criteria (≥50% decrease in HRSD24) and 5/16 met remission criteria (HRSD24≤10). Patients achieved full re-orientation (4 of 5 items correct) in 5.5 + 6.4 min (median time = 3.6 min), timed from when their eyes first opened after treatment. The investigators have now studied 18 more patients (see results below), and we are completing the study in the original IDE with another two more patients still to enroll.\n\nThis work allowed us to refine the treatment. For example, the investigators selectively modified the electrode geometry to decrease interelectrode resistance. Additionally the investigators modified the titration schedule, now only administering a standard 800 ma ultrabrief pulse, and thus no longer titrating in the current domain.\n\nIn this next proposed trial we will continue to gather efficacy and safety data, and compare these to a parallel non-randomized group receiving ECT standard of care.\n\nECT is typically delivered in a dynamically adaptive manner, with each person having a different number of treatments, averaging between 8-12 treatment over 4-5 weeks. We thus have to use imprecise time points such as 'at the end of the acute treatment course' rather than specified dates or visits.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change in Depressive Symptoms as Assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression","timeFrame":"From Baseline to end of acute course (typically after 4 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FEAST","deltaMin":60.83,"sd":18.36},{"arm":"RUL UB","deltaMin":61.81,"sd":20.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23518262","34015791"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["headache","muscle ache","Nausea","prolonged seizure","postictal agitation),"]}}
