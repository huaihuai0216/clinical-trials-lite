Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects) or darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800 mg/100 mg once daily (approximately 234 subjects), each in combination with fixed-dose dual nucleoside reverse transriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy (either abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) or tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC). Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV-1 RNA and background NRTI selection. The primary analysis will take place after the last subject completes 48 weeks on therapy; an additional analysis will be conducted after the last subject completes Week 96 on study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) <50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG 50 mg QD","deltaMin":90,"sd":null},{"arm":"DRV 800 mg + RTV 100 mg QD","deltaMin":83,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.025"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":66,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Italy","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Spain","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26424673","24698485"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":242},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Headache","Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
