The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether lanreotide is also effective on tumour volume reduction (tumour shrinkage) and the benefits of this potential tumour shrinkage on disease symptoms and patient's quality of life.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With Relevant Reduction in Pituitary Tumour Volume (as Measured by MRI) From Baseline Volume (Visit 1) to Week 48 (After 12 Injections at Visit 5)","timeFrame":"Week 1 and Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lanreotide Autogel 120 mg","deltaMin":62.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":27,"countries":["Belgium","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24423301","26603536"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":90},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Alopecia","Gastrointestinal disorder","Abdominal pain","Cholelithiasis 6 (6.7%) [7]"]}}
