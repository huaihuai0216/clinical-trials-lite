At the end of the run-in period, subjects who meet the randomization criteria will be randomized to receive UMEC 62.5 mcg administered via novel dry powder inhaler(nDPI) + Placebo administered via HANDIHALER inhaler OR Tiotropium 18 mcg administered via HANDIHALER inhaler + Placebo administered via nDPI in a 1:1 ratio. There will be up to 8 clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis at Pre-Screening (Visit 0), Screening (Visit 1), a 7 to 14 day run-in period, randomization at Day 1 (Visit 2), and after randomization at Day 2 (Visit 3), Day 28 (Visit 4), Day 56 (Visit 5), Day 84 (Visit 6) and Day 85 (Visit 7). For subjects enrolled in Germany, there will be an additional 3 visits at Day 112 (Visit 8), Day 140 (Visit 9) and Day 168 (Visit 10). The total duration of subject participation in the study will be approximately 15 weeks (27 weeks in Germany). The primary endpoint of the study is clinic visit trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on treatment Day 85. All subjects will have spirometry performed at clinic Visits 1 though 7. Trough spirometry will be obtained 23 and 24 hours after the previous day's dose of blinded study medication at Visits 3 to 7.\n\nHANDIHALER is a registered trademark of Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH \\& Co.
