The interview and rating for the C-SSRS was completed by a clinician who had been successfully trained by the sponsor or designee. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answers to the first 2 ideation questions were \"yes,\" the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered \"yes\" to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were \"no,\" then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With an Improved Response on The Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-I) Scale","description":"The CGI rating scales permitted the global evaluation of a participant's condition severity and improvement over time. The CGI-I was performed to rate the improvement of a participant's condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) and included a 'not assessed' option. The responses were dichotomized into 2 categories (improved or not improved). Improved included very much improved and much improved; not improved included minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse. Not assessed and missing values were excluded from the percentage calculation.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"88.5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"92.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"89.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in The Global Score for The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)","description":"The EDE-Q is a 28-item questionnaire measuring eating pathology and is derived directly from the Eating Disorder Examination Interview.

The 28 items are rated by the participant on a 7-point scale (ranging from 0 to 6), with higher scores indicating increased pathology. The EDE-Q includes 4 subscales: Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern, and Shape Concern. The global score is the average of all 28 items, with a range of 0 to 6.
