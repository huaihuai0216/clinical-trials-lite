A secondary aim is to carefully characterize these subjects using clinical rating scales and develop pilot data on a very young cohort of children with bipolar disorders that can be used to support an application to NIMH for a prospective, longitudinal study that will provide important information about the course, medication response, neurobiology and outcome of these patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"YMRS","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Valproate (VPA)","deltaMin":10,"sd":2.46},{"arm":"Risperidone","deltaMin":18.82,"sd":1.55},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.29,"sd":3.56}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25978742"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":["nausea"]}}
