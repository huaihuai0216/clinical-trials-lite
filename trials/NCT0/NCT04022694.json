Policies to place health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages are being pursued, but there is little empirical data on how such labels influence people. The primary aim of this study is to test the association between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) warning posters compared to control posters and change in SSBs purchased compared to baseline by adolescents shopping at school cafeterias in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The hypothesis is that posters with information warning people of the health harms associated with overconsuming SSBs and promoting low sugar beverages will be associated with greater reductions in SSB purchases compared to a control poster.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Volume of SSBs Per Transaction","timeFrame":"Through study period (either 4 weeks baseline, or 4 weeks intervention)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Baseline for Calorie/Control Poster","deltaMin":116.2,"sd":212.5},{"arm":"Baseline for SSB Warning and Non-SSB Promotion Poster","deltaMin":89.8,"sd":160.1},{"arm":"Calorie/Control Poster","deltaMin":115.3,"sd":211.8},{"arm":"SSB Warning and Non-SSB Promotion Poster","deltaMin":103.4,"sd":176.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Guatemala"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":167},"commonTop":[]}}
