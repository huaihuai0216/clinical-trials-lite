In addition, the safety of subcutaneous (SC) golimumab injections following transition from IV golimumab infusions will also be evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 Response at Week 14","timeFrame":"Week 0 to Week 14","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group I: 2mg/kg Golimumab+ MTX","deltaMin":28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group II: 2mg/kg Golimumab Only","deltaMin":16,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group III: 4mg/kg Golimumab + MTX","deltaMin":27,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group IV: 4mg/kg Golimumab Only","deltaMin":25,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group V: IV Placebo + MTX","deltaMin":17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group VI: Combined Groups I and III","deltaMin":55,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group VII: Combined Groups II and IV","deltaMin":41,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG004 vs OG005","p":"0.051"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":"0.073"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG004","p":"0.093"},{"comp":"OG004 vs OG006","p":"0.465"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG004","p":"0.872"},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":"0.175"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":72,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Colombia","Germany","Hungary","Latvia","Lithuania","Malaysia","Malta","Mexico","New Zealand","Peru","Poland","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28606966","24757132","22776409","22089463","20131276"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":25,"n":182},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Rheumatoid arthritis","Headache","Bronchitis","Nausea"]}}
