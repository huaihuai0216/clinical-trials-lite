The investigators hypothesize that the use of calcitriol supplementation will result in improved vascular endothelial function as compared to cholecalciferol supplementation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Compare the Difference Between the Calcitriol and Cholecalciferol Groups in Conduit Artery Endothelium-dependent Dilation (EDD) in Response to Treatment.","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cholecalciferol","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":4.2},{"arm":"Calcitriol","deltaMin":0.3,"sd":3.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":64},"commonTop":["Hypercalcemia"]}}
