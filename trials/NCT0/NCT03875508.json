The POST module includes four principal causal domains: feelings about injections, self-confidence, pain and reaction during or after the injection, and ease of use, plus two additional domains on satisfaction with self-injection and self-image. Participants rate each item of the SIAQ 20 to 40 minutes following injections, and the ratings are transformed to scores ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience). The domain score is the mean of the item scores included in the domain. Higher domain scores indicate wider acceptability by subjects to use the autoinjector.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.358","spread":"2.3613"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.556","spread":"2.0646"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.056","spread":"1.0321"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.817","spread":"0.4469"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.82","spread":"1.415"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.53","spread":"1.261"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.478","spread":"2.0024"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.112","spread":"2.6313"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.096","spread":"1.1572"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.700","spread":"0.5710"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.84","spread":"1.240"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.16","spread":"1.964"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.750","spread":"1.8483"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.367","spread":"2.5921"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.229","spread":"1.1517"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.763","spread":"0.4576"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.93","spread":"1.394"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.28","spread":"1.678"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.675","spread":"2.0661"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.795","spread":"2.3034"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.458","spread":"1.0500"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.725","spread":"0.8911"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.39","spread":"0.971"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.34","spread":"1.614"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score up to Week 16","description":"The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination.
