Investigators want to determine the cost-effectiveness related to allogenic blood transfusion as a blood loss management strategy in acetabular open reduction internal fixation (ORIF). Orthopaedic surgery carries with it a significant risk for blood loss. Current management of perioperative blood loss is the use of allogenic blood transfusion. Allogenic blood transfusion carries with it a risk for HIV and Hepatitis C as well as multiple adverse reactions. There have been significant efforts to reduce the use of allogenic blood transfusion in orthopaedic surgery. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used in management of blood during surgery. In order to determine the impact of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss among patients undergoing acetabular ORIF, investigators will conduct a prospective randomized study. Patients undergoing acetabular surgery will be screened for this study. Patients will be then randomized to placebo or tranexamic acid which will be administered during and after surgery. The following data will be collected: patient characteristics, surgery information, blood loss, blood transfusions, wound complication within 30 days of surgery, and cost.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Allogenic Blood Transfusion Rates","timeFrame":"post-operative","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tranexamic","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["742821","11728069","9058494","10919295","9973048","10934623","10413276","17966532","19385529","19201714","11049894","18480196","15188109","16950041","12697586","6829965","14763696","11011672","16156456","19007970","15995116","17679019","19121192","21936146","16470437","16487712","19483232","12662278","11861727","19390361","20554319","17570287","21196541","11174160","16950076","8666599","17065899","19926634"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":45},"commonTop":[]}}
