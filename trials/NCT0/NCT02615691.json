This includes the buildup of antibodies against FVIII which may stop BAX855 from working properly. Another aim is to learn how well BAX855 controls bleeding.\n\nIn this study, the children can receive BAX855 either as preventative treatment (prophylaxis), or as needed to treat bleeding (on-demand).\n\nIn case a participant develops antibodies, treatment will be provided as part of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With FVIII Inhibitor Development","timeFrame":"Throughout Part A of the study, approximately 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part A: Main Study","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","Italy","Malaysia","Netherlands","Norway","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37646148"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b5fc74db2bf003ab45e99"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":80},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Viral infection"]}}
