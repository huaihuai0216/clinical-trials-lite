The toxicity within the upper urinary tract was considered consistent with the disease under study and the mode of administration of UGN-101. Most events in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC were mild to moderate in severity and resolved. No new risks were identified and the overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of endoscopic administration of intravesical mitomycin and of mitomycin.
