received an alloHSCT while in remission and did not receive any additional anti-leukemic treatment. 100-day mortality after alloHSCT was calculated relative to the date of alloHSCT.\n\nThe 100-day mortality rate after alloHSCT was defined as the percentage of participants having died up to 100 days after alloHSCT, estimated using the estimated time to death in percent calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Participants still alive were censored at the date they were last known to be alive.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Anti-Blinatumomab Antibodies Postbaseline (Blinatumomab Arm Only)","description":"Participants receiving blinatumomab had blood samples analyzed for binding antibodies.
