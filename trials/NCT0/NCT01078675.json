This is known as pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.\n\nAt baseline only a small number of patients will participate in a single dose PK phase over 24 hours.\n\nIn order to see if this medication works, a control group of healthy siblings will help the researchers to compare certain results.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in LDL-C","timeFrame":"At Month 3, Month 12 and Month 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rosuvastatin","deltaMin":-37.86,"sd":14.392}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Netherlands","Norway"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28592434","24192652","23684512"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=1357&filename=D3561C00002.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":197},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Influenza","Vomiting","Nausea"]}}
