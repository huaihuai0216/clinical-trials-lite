This infection is somewhat common and is routinely treated with antibiotics given to the mother both before and after the baby is born. Currently it is not known what is the best choice of antibiotics to treat this type of infection, but commonly used treatments include Unasyn (ampicillin/sulbactam) or ampicillin/gentamicin. We plan to compare these two different antibiotic regimens to see if one is better than the other at treating and preventing bad outcomes from chorioamnionitis in women and babies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Success Defined as Resolution of Fever by 24 Hours Postpartum","timeFrame":"Up to 24 hours after delivery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Unasyn (Ampicillin/Sulbactam)","deltaMin":43,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ampicillin/Gentamicin","deltaMin":49,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"1.0"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2014.10.310"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":43},"commonTop":["Rash","Postpartum endometritis"]}}
