Abnormal PTT within 48 hours prior to randomization after receiving heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor (such as bivalirudin, argatroban, dabigatran or lepirudin)\n21. Received Factor Xa inhibitors (such as Fondaparinaux, apixaban or rivaroxaban) within the past 48 hours\n22. Received glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors within the past 14 days\n23. Pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease which confounded the neurological or functional evaluations e.g., baseline modified Rankin score \\>3\n24. Other serious, advanced, or terminal illness or any other condition that the investigator felt would pose a significant hazard to the patient if rt-PA, TNK, eptifibatide or argatroban therapy was initiated\n\n    a. Example: known cirrhosis or clinically significant hepatic disease\n25. Current participation in another research drug treatment or interventional device trial - Subjects could not start another experimental agent until after 90 days\n26. Informed consent from the patient or the legally authorized representative was not or could not be obtained\n27. High density lesion consistent with hemorrhage of any degree\n28. Large (more than 1/3 of the middle cerebral artery) regions of clear hypodensity on the baseline CT Scan.
