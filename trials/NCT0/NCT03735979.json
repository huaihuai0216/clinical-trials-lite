Patients may also receive endovascular thrombectomy (ET) per usual care. Time of onset is defined as the last time the patient was last known to be well.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"90-day Utility Weighted Modified Rankin Scores (UW-mRS)","timeFrame":"90 days after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Argatroban","deltaMin":5.2,"sd":3.7},{"arm":"Eptifibatide","deltaMin":6.3,"sd":3.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.002"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.04"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":61,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40824660","40123511","39231343","37256980","33297893"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":59},"commonTop":["Cerebral haemorrhage","Haematoma","Atrial fibrillation","Headache","Haemorrhagic transformation stroke"]}}
