The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Can giving Ophiocephalus striatus extract at a dose of 2x5 grams for 2 weeks increase IGF-1 levels in elderly people with sarcopenia?\n2. Can administration of 2x5 grams dose of Ophiocephalus striatus extract for 2 weeks reduce IL-6 levels in elderly with sarcopenia?\n3. Can the administration of Ophiocephalus striatus extract at a dose of 2x5 grams for 2 weeks reduce the SARC-F score in elderly people with sarcopenia?\n4. Can the administration of Ophiocephalus striatus extract at a dose of 2x5 grams for 2 weeks increase muscle mass in elderly people with sarcopenia?\n5. Can the administration of Ophiocephalus striatus extract at a dose of 2x5 grams for 2 weeks increase muscle strength in elderly people with sarcopenia?\n6. Can administration of Ophiocephalus striatus extract at a dose of 2x5 grams for 2 weeks improve physical performance in elderly with sarcopenia?\n\nParticipants will:\n\n1. Consume Ophiochepalus striatus extract 2x5 grams a day.\n2. Checked blood before and after the intervention.\n3. Measured muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance before and after the intervention.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"IGF-1 Levels","timeFrame":"2 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":78.92,"sd":21.7},{"arm":"Ophiochepalus Striatus Extract","deltaMin":77.08,"sd":20.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Indonesia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38525752"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Subjective complaint","Subjective complaint"]}}
