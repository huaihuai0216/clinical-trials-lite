Patient has completely resected middle turbinate.\n19. Patient has known dehiscence of the lamina papyracea.\n20. Patient has evidence of active viral illness (e.g., tuberculosis, ocular herpes simplex, chickenpox, or measles).\n\n    Ocular Exclusion Criteria\n21. Patient has history or diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension (baseline or a known prior ocular exam indicating IOP \\>21 mm Hg)\n22. Patient has closed angle (with or without the presence of peripheral anterior synechiae on gonioscopy)\n23.
