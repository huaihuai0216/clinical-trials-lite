Group one will receive the new four-drug combination. Group two will receive the standard treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone).\n\nThe boys in group one will take the medication until the age of 14 at which time they will stop taking the four-drug combination and begin receiving the standard treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Girls in group one will take the four-drug combination until the age of 13, at which time they will stop and begin receiving the standard treatment for congenital adrenal hyperplasia plus flutamide. Flutamide will be given to the girls until two years after their first menstrual period or until adult height.\n\nAll of the children will be followed until they reach their final adult height. The effectiveness of the treatment will be determined by measuring the patient's adult height.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Adult Height Relative to General Population","timeFrame":"Followed to attainment of adult height, average of 11 years from date of randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Investigational Therapy","deltaMin":-0.34,"sd":0.93},{"arm":"Standard Therapy","deltaMin":-0.6,"sd":0.89}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39672600"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?B_1996-CH-0033.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":31},"commonTop":["Febrile infection","Vomiting","Fracture","Pharyngitis streptococcal","Emergency care"]}}
