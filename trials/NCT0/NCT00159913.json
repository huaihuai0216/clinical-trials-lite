The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 16 weeks of chronic treatment with oral sildenafil given in three different doses, compared to placebo (inactive treatment). Efficacy will be measured by exercise and hemodynamics. Patients who complete this trial may be eligible to take part in an extension study, in which all patients will receive active treatment of sildenafil.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in Peak Volume of Oxygen (VO2) Consumed : Intent To Treat Population","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sildenafil Low Dose","deltaMin":6.44,"sd":20.16},{"arm":"Sildenafil Medium Dose","deltaMin":13.4,"sd":19.5},{"arm":"Sildenafil High Dose","deltaMin":10.58,"sd":15.51},{"arm":"Combined Sildenafil","deltaMin":10.24,"sd":18.39},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.53,"sd":15.91}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":"0.056"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG004","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG004","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":41,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Colombia","Guatemala","Hungary","India","Italy","Japan","Malaysia","Mexico","Peru","Poland","Russia","Sweden","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31908813","31538282","28676038","22963001","22128226"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A1481131&StudyName=A%20Randomized%2C%20Double-Blind%2C%20Placebo-Controlled%20Study%20of%20Sildenafil%20in%20Children%20with%20Pulmonary%20Arterial%20Hypertension."]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1},"commonTop":["Headache","Vomiting","Upper respiratory tract infection","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea"]}}
