Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* A male or female, aged 18 years or older and having reached the age of legal consent, on the date the informed consent is signed.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject.\n* Subject who has received an ABO compatible allogeneic renal transplant.\n* Subject receiving maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of allograft rejection for a minimum of one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination.\n* Subject without an episode of allograft rejection over the previous three months (90 days) prior to the first vaccination.\n* Subject with stable renal function, stability defined as:\n\n  * less than 20% variability between last two creatinine measurements or calculated GFR\n  * or in the opinion of the investigator after investigator review of more than the last two creatinine measurements or calculated GFRs.\n* Subject not less than 4 months (120 days) and not more than 18 months (547 days) after allograft transplantation at the time of the first vaccination.\n* Subjects with multiple dialysis options (peritoneal and/or more than one anatomical access site for haemodialysis) in the event acute or chronic dialysis is needed.\n* Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject:\n\n  * has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and\n  * has a negative pregnancy test on the day of the first vaccination, and\n  * has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the primary treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any primary kidney disease with a high incidence of recurrent primary kidney disease.\n* Evidence of recurrent primary kidney disease within the current allograft.\n* Previous allograft loss secondary to recurrent primary kidney disease.\n\n  * Multiple kidney transplants are allowed if the reason for a previous allograft's loss is not recurrent primary kidney disease.\n* More than one organ transplanted (i.e. kidney-liver, double kidney or kidney-other organ(s) transplanted).\n* History of events that, in the opinion of the investigator, may put subject at increased risk for chronic allograft dysfunction (e.g. delayed graft function, peri-operative complications).\n* Histologic reports of chronic allograft injury (e.g. transplant glomerulopathy, arteriopathy, C4d deposition).\n* Evidence of significant proteinuria in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Panel reactive antibody score (PRA or cPRA) that is unknown at the time of transplant.\n* Any autoimmune or potential immune-mediated disease including primary kidney disease.\n* Use of anti-CD20 or other B-cell monoclonal antibody agents (e.g., rituximab) as induction, maintenance and/or therapeutic immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of allograft rejection within 9 months (274 days) of first dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or planned use during the study period.\n* Concurrent or planned participation in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, which has exposed or will expose the subject to an investigational or a non-registered product\n* Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a non-replicating vaccine within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n* Planned administration during the study of a varicella or HZ vaccine other than the study vaccine.\n* Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n* Occurrence of varicella or HZ per clinical history, within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo.\n* Failure to fully complete the 7-day pre-vaccination diary card distributed at the Pre-vaccination visit.\n* Evidence or high suspicion, in the opinion of the investigator, of noncompliance or nonadherence to use of induction and/or maintenance immunosuppressive therapies.\n* Any confirmed or suspected HIV, primary immunodeficiency disease, disseminated or untreated malignancy, or systemic infection.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine or study material and equipment.\n* Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluations required by the study.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F by oral route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 3.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With a Vaccine Response for Anti-glycoprotein E (gE) Humoral Immunogenicity","description":"Vaccine response was defined as: For initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination greater than or equal to (≥) 4 fold the cut-off for Anti-gE (4x97 milli-international units per milliliter \\[mIU/ml\\]); For initially seropositive subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration.
