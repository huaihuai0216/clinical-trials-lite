If troponin T (cTnT) is not available at local institution then troponin I (cTnI) may be used. Thresholds for cTnT, cTnI, and NT-proBNP are \\< 0.035 ug/L, \\< 0.1 ug/L, and \\< 332 ng/L, respectively. Stage I patients have both troponin-T (or I) and NT-proBNP below the threshold. Stage II patients have either troponin-T (I) or NT-proBNP above the threshold. Stage III patients have troponin-T (or I) and simultaneous NT-proBNP above the threshold.
