Study subjects will be biologically assigned to the appropriate arm depending on the availability of an HLA-matched sibling. There is a nested randomized phase III trial of observation versus maintenance therapy following the second autologous transplant for patients on the tandem autologous transplant arm.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Year 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Auto-Auto Standard Risk","deltaMin":46,"sd":null},{"arm":"Auto-Allo Standard Risk","deltaMin":43,"sd":null},{"arm":"Auto-Auto High Risk","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Auto-Allo High Risk","deltaMin":40,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":36,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21962393","19029209","31756536"],"seeAlso":["https://bethematch.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":436},"commonTop":["Thrombocytopenia","Angiosarcoma"]}}
