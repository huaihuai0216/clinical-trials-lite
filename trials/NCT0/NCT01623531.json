Because the reagents used to perform the PT test vary from one laboratory to another and even within the same laboratory over time, the normal ranges also will fluctuate. To standardize results across different laboratories in the world, a World Health Organization (WHO) committee developed and recommended the use of the Internationalized Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR is calculated with the ratio of the patient's prothrombin time (PT test) to a normal prothrombin time (control) sample (PT normal): INR=PT test:PT normal. The normal range is from 0.9 to 1.2. The higher the value the more is the patient anticoagulated. This means the patient's blood is thinner with a lower concentration of coagulation factors.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Prothrombin Time (s)","description":"The prothrombin time (PT) test evaluates how well all of the coagulation factors in the extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade work together.
