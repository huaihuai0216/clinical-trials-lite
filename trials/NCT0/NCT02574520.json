Given once by the surgeon at the end of surgery, SABER® - Bupivacaine delivers a locally-acting pain reliever directly to the surgical wound.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to measure how well it works in reducing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (surgery to remove the gall bladder) and to investigate the safety of SABER®-Bupivacaine (its side effects).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Intensity on Movement From 0-48 Hours Post-Treatment","timeFrame":"Assessed from 0 to 48 hours post-dose, summary measure (see description) reported.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 2/SABER-Bupivacaine","deltaMin":5.55,"sd":0.065},{"arm":"Part 2/Bupivacaine HCl","deltaMin":5.87,"sd":0.059}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.124"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":45},"commonTop":["Post procedural contusion","Somnolence (Solicited)","Constipation (Solicited)","Headache (Solicited)","Nausea"]}}
