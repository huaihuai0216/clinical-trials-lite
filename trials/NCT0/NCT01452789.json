In an open label Phase 1 trial sublingual buprenorphine was associated with a \\~30% reduction length of treatment compared to standard of care morphine. Due to the subjective nature of the scoring instrument, efficacy in a blinded trial is needed to unequivocally establish the superiority of buprenorphine over morphine. The primary objective of the trial is to compare length of treatment using sublingual buprenorphine or oral morphine solution in the pharmacologic treatment of the NAS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Length of Treatment","timeFrame":"Patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sublingual Buprenorphine","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oral Morphine","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20925688","18694901","34231914","28468518"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":33},"commonTop":["diaper rash","Rash","Gastrointestinal","Respiratory Infection","anemia"]}}
