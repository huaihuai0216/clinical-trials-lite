Subjects will provide informed consent before any study-specific procedures are performed. Subject enrollment may begin in the hospital and will continue following release from the hospital. Screening procedures may be performed at the time of the index ACS event or anytime thereafter, with the condition that randomization must occur within the mandated window (4-12 weeks after the index event). Subjects will be assessed based on their medical history. Those who are likely to qualify will undergo Genotype Assay testing to evaluate genetic determination for the presence of AA genotype.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Composite of Cardiovascular Death, Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest, Non-Fatal Myocardial Infarction, and Non-Fatal Stroke","timeFrame":"From randomization to the first occurrence of any component of the composite primary endpoint (median duration of follow-up was 39.9 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":327,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dalcetrapib","deltaMin":292,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.12"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":557,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","New Zealand","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Arab Emirates","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35856777","34173811","32087417"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":923,"n":3076},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Chest pain","Diarrhoea","Dyspnoea"]}}
