Investigations in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom have not identified this effect. While it is not possible to have an answer to whether this affect is real prior to the second wave of the 2009 pandemic, it remains vital to future influenza vaccination programs that the hypothesis that, in 2009, seasonal vaccine increases or decreases the risk of pH1N1 infection be confirmed or refuted.\n\nThe objective of this study is to determine whether Ontario adults aged 18-60 years who receive the 2009 seasonal influenza vaccine will be at a 2 fold or greater increased risk of infection with influenza pH1N1 during the second or third wave of the 2009 pandemic.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of pH1N1 Influenza Infections as Diagnosed by PCR From Mid-turbinate Swab","timeFrame":"day +7 post seasonal influenza vaccination (or placebo) to end of study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Seasonal Influenza Vaccination","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.685"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":234},"commonTop":[]}}
