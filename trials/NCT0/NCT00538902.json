Summary scores are calculated using the following 8 scales: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The score for a component is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0 (not functioning) to 100 (highest functioning). An increase in SF-36 PCS or MCS indicates improved health status.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36.50","spread":"10.894"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.74","spread":"11.494"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.73","spread":"12.686"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.22","spread":"11.699"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.51","spread":"11.268"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.29","spread":"11.285"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.56","spread":"10.716"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.75","spread":"10.825"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.09","spread":"11.998"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.14","spread":"11.867"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Injection site pruritus"]}}}
