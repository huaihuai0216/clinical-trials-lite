Participants will be randomized to receive either erlotinib 150 milligrams (mg) orally (PO) once daily or placebo. Participants who progress on placebo will receive erlotinib 150 mg PO once daily as second-line therapy, and those who progress on erlotinib may switch to a non-investigational, second-line chemotherapy. Treatments will continue until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. Participants may also be entered into a final Survival Follow-Up (SFU) period upon treatment discontinuation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Died During the Overall Study","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 3.5 years (visits at Baseline and Weeks 6, 12, and 18 and every 12 weeks until/at disease progression during BP; per local standards during OLP; then every 12 weeks during SFU until death)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Late Erlotinib","deltaMin":73.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Early Erlotinib","deltaMin":75.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":155,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Czechia","France","Hungary","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Taiwan","Thailand","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":319},"commonTop":["Rash","Diarrhoea","Cough","Dyspnoea","Fatigue"]}}
