Subjects with known allergies to more than 3 substances (an allergy questionnaire will be completed during the screening process).\n10. Subjects with history of severe allergic reaction to any substance, having required treatment with intravenous steroids/intramuscular epinephrine, or who in the opinion of the PI is at high risk of developing severe allergic reactions.\n11.

Subjects diagnosed with CVA within the past 6 months prior to randomization.\n15. Subjects who underwent any abdominal surgery and current planned index surgery involves re-opening the scar of a prior abdominal surgery performed within the last 3 years.\n16. Any subject with an active malignancy, other than resectable non-metastatic colorectal cancer, that is the reason for the index surgery, or carcinoma in situ (or other cancer \"in situ = Stage 0\"), or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or a malignancy that has not been in complete clinical remission and without maintenance chemo or immunotherapy for at least 3 years.\n17.

Psychiatric or any other disorder that compromises ability to provide informed consent for participation in this study.\n19. Chronic alcoholic or drug abuse subjects.\n20. Pregnant or breast-feeding women or women of child-bearing age who refuse or are prohibited of using an effective contraceptive method of birth control throughout study participation, including the safety follow-up period.\n21. Subjects who received any investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to randomization to the study (whichever is longer) and through the study.\n22. Subjects participating in any other interventional study.\n23. Subjects, who in the opinion of Investigator, are not eligible to participate in the study and/or to comply with the protocol requirements (e.g. due to a cognitive or medical condition).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"99 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"To Assess the Anti-infective Efficacy of D-PLEX Over a Period of 30 Days Post Operation, by Preventing Surgical Site Infection (SSI), Defined as Superficial and Deep Infection, in the Target Incision(s), Compared to the SoC Treated Control.","description":"Infection rate as measured by the proportion of subjects with at least one abdominal incisional infection event, as determined by a blinded and independent adjudication committee, within 30 days post-abdominal surgery. \\[Abdominal incisional infection is composed of Deep Incisional Surgical Site Infection (DSSI) and Superficial Incisional Surgical Site Infection (SSSI)\\].
