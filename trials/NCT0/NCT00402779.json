Male or female patients with one of the following: (a) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p14 and/or 9p21 in the oral IEN of patients with a history of curatively treated oral cancer or (b) LOH at 3p14 and/or 9p21 plus at one other chromosomal region in the IEN of patients with no oral cancer history.\n2. Participants must have confirmed diagnosis of oral IEN lesion with LOH. (Note:The initial screening biopsy of oral IEN lesion with LOH must be obtained within 12 months of study enrollment. If initial diagnostic biopsy for LOH is \\> 3 months prior to study enrollment, investigators may use clinical judgment to order an additional screening biopsy to assess histopathological changes).\n3. Age \\>/= 18 years\n4. ECOG performance status \\<2\n5. Participants must have normal organ \\& marrow function as defined below w/in 30 days of randomization:CBC w/ differential white cell count-acceptable results must include:WBC \\>3,000ul, hemoglobin\\>10 g/dl, platelet count \\> 125,000ul, LFTs-total bilirubin \\& alkaline phosphatase, AST (SGOT) \\& ALT (SPGT) all w/in \\<1.5xULN.Note:At the discretion of the attending physician,participants w/ Gilbert's disease may still be eligible to participate in the event the total bilirubin value is \\>1.5xULN. Kidney function-serum creatinine\\< 1.5xULN Chemistry-Sodium \\& potassium all w/in normal institutional limits.\n6.
