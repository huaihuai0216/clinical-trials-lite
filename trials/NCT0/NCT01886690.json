Each question is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none of the time and 4 = all of the time). The scores are totaled over the 12 questions and normalized/converted to a score of 0-100 (0=no disability and 100=complete disability).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.99","spread":"8.511"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.63","spread":"7.071"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Corneal Staining in the Worse Eye","description":"The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye which covers the iris and pupil. Corneal staining in the worse eye following administration of fluorescein dye in the eye is graded using a 6-point scale (0=no staining, 5=severe staining) over 5 areas of the clear central part of the eye for a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 25. The higher the grade score, the worse the dry eye condition. A negative change from baseline represents a decrease in corneal staining (improvement) and a positive change from baseline represents an increase in corneal staining (worsening).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.9","spread":"1.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.2","spread":"1.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.2","spread":"1.96"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.3","spread":"1.61"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Tear Break-up Time (TBUT) in the Worse Eye","description":"TBUT is the time required for dry spots to appear on the surface of the eye after blinking in the worse eye. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. A short TBUT is a sign of poor tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in TBUT (improvement) and a negative number change from baseline indicates a decrease in TBUT (worsening).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.88","spread":"11.656"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.27","spread":"5.121"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.21","spread":"9.299"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.08","spread":"5.304"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Schirmer Test in the Worse Eye","description":"The Schirmer's Test measures the rate of the secretion of tears produced by the eye over 5 minutes in the worse eye. The results indicate the presence of dry eye (Normal = greater than or equal to 10 millimeters (mm) of tears, Dry Eye = less than 10 mm of tears). The smaller the number, the more severe the dry eye.
