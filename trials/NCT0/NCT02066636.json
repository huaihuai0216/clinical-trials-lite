A switch of an agent within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new line of therapy\n* Maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based chemotherapy is not considered as a separate regimen of therapy\n* Subjects who received platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, and developed recurrent (local or metastatic) disease within 6 months of completing therapy are eligible\n* Subjects with recurrent disease \\>6 months after platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, who also subsequently progressed during or after a platinum doublet-based regimen given to treat the recurrence are eligible\n* Subjects with non-squamous histology must be tested for Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations (including, but not limited to, deletions in exon 19 and exon 21 \\[L858R\\] substitution) and Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) rearrangement if tests have not been previously performed. Subjects with progressive disease during or after EGFR or ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) regimens are eligible. Subjects are eligible if genetic test results are indeterminate or if no tumor tissue is available or accessible for testing as long as they have received one prior systemic therapy\n* Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered as separate line of therapy\n* Subjects must have measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria (radiographic tumor assessment performed within 28 days of first dose of study drug) or clinically apparent disease that the investigator can follow for response per RECIST 1.1\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Arm (ECOG) performance status (PS)\n* PS 0 to 1\n* PS 2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Target Disease Exceptions\n\n   * Subjects with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded\n   * Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis\n2.
