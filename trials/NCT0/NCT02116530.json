Antiemetic drugs, such as palonosetron hydrochloride, ondansetron, and granisetron hydrochloride, may help lessen or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy. Olanzapine may help prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting by blocking brain receptors that appear to be involved in nausea and vomiting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients With no Nausea","timeFrame":"0 to 120 hours after chemotherapy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Olanzapine","deltaMin":73.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":45.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":177,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27410922"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":188},"commonTop":["Somnolence","Fatigue","Nausea","Headache","Dizziness"]}}
