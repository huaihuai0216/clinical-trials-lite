Criteria for hospitalization will be up to the individual treating clinician.\n* For women of child-bearing potential: willingness to abstain from sexual intercourse or use at least one form of hormonal or barrier contraception through Day 28 of the study\n* Willingness to have blood and respiratory samples obtained and stored\n* NEW score greater than or equal to 2 at screening (see the protocol for more information on this criterion)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Strong clinical evidence (in the judgment of the site investigator) that the etiology of illness is primarily bacterial in origin\n* Prior treatment with any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to screening\n* History of allergic reaction to blood or plasma products (as judged by the site investigator)\n* Known immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency\n* A pre-existing condition or use of a medication that, in the opinion of the site investigator, may place the participant at a substantially increased risk of thrombosis (e.g., cryoglobulinemia, severe refractory hypertriglyceridemia, or clinically significant monoclonal gammopathy)\n* Presence of any pre-existing illness that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would place the participant at an unreasonably increased risk through participation in this study\n* Participants who, in the judgment of the site investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the requirements of this protocol\n* Medical conditions for which receipt of a 500 mL volume of intravenous fluid may be dangerous to the participant (e.g., decompensated congestive heart failure)\n* Receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)\n* Suspicion that infection is due to an influenza strain or subtype other than A(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, or influenza B (e.g., H5N1, H7N9)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
