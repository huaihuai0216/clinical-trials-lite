Observational data suggest that increased dietary intake of lutein + zeaxanthin (carotenoids), omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid \\[DHA\\] + eicosapentaenoic acid \\[EPA\\]), or both might further reduce this risk. AREDS2 was designed to test whether adding lutein + zeaxanthin, DHA + EPA, or lutein + zeaxanthin and DHA + EPA to the AREDS formulation might further reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD. A secondary goal was to test the effects of eliminating beta carotene and reducing zinc dose in the AREDS formulation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Development of Advanced AMD in People at Moderate to High Risk for Progression.","timeFrame":"5 years of follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo/Control","deltaMin":493,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lutein/Zeaxanthin","deltaMin":468,"sd":null},{"arm":"DHA/EPA","deltaMin":507,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lutein/Zeaxanthin + DHA/EPA","deltaMin":472,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.013"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.013"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.013"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37702300","34793832","32285590","26305649","24638908","24310343","23887802","23830564","23645227","23644932","23620429","22879423","18421079"],"seeAlso":["http://www.nei.nih.gov/areds2/","http://www.areds2.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":479,"n":1012},"commonTop":["Vitreous disorder","Upper respiratory tract infection","Visual disturbance","Eye disorder","Urinary tract infection"]}}
