Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 4. Hospitalized, requiring low flow supplemental oxygen; 5. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (coronavirus (COVID-19) related or otherwise); 6. Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer required ongoing medical care (other than per protocol remdesivir administration; 7. Not hospitalized.
