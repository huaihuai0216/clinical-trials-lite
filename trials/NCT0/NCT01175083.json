Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by a witness.\n\nAdditional inclusion criteria for children with SCD (\\<6S, 7-11S and 12-23S groups):\n\n* Children with diagnosis of sickle cell disease \\[homozygous sickle cell disease (hemoglobin SS disease), double heterozygous sickle hemoglobin C disease (hemoglobin SC disease) and the sickle ß-thalassemias\\] and confirmed hemoglobin status by hemoglobin chromatography and electrophoresis (\\<6S group) or electrophoresis (7-11S and 12-23S groups).\n* Free of any other known or suspected health problems (as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study), that would contraindicate the initiation of routine immunizations outside a clinical trial context\n\nAdditional inclusion criteria for healthy children (\\<6NS, 7-11NS and 12-23NS groups):\n\n* Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.\n* Children with negative diagnosis of sickle cell disease and confirmed hemoglobin status by hemoglobin chromatography and/or electrophoresis.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Child in care\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of study vaccines and ending 30 days after. Locally recommended vaccines (recommended through the EPI program or through national immunization campaigns) for example inactivated influenza vaccine are always allowed, even if concomitantly administered with the study vaccines, but should be documented in the eCRF.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Previous vaccination or planned vaccination during the study with any pneumococcal vacccine.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s).\n* Major congenital malformations.\n* History of any neurological disorders or seizures.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.\n* Birth weight below 1500g.\n* Serious chronic illness other than SCD.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal setting.
