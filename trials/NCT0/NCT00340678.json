Ninety-two of the subjects had normal urinary albumin excretion at baseline and other 78 had microalbuminuria. Subjects in each albumin excretion group were randomized to treatment with either the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, losartan, or placebo. Measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF) and fractional clearances of albumin and IgG will be made initially, at one month, and at 12-month intervals from baseline thereafter. A kidney biopsy was performed after six years in 111 subjects. Morphometric analysis of renal biopsies was used to determine differences in glomerular structure between treatment groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Decline in GFR","timeFrame":"Up to 6 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Normoalbuminuria Losartan","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Normoalbuminuria Placebo","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Microalbuminuria Losartan","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Microalbuminuria Placebo","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["3862110","3011862","2681929","23545707","38682786","34437304","34027894","31573977","27612501","22718189"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":84},"commonTop":["Urethral obstruction after kidney biopsy"]}}
