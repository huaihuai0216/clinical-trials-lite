A participant's blood stem cells were collected and modified (transduced) using the Lenti-D lentiviral vector encoding human adrenoleukodystrophy protein. After modification (transduction) with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector, the cells were transplanted back into the participant following myeloablative conditioning. Participants in this study will be continuously followed in study LTF-304.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Were Alive and Have None of the 6 Major Functional Disabilities (MFDs) at Month 24 and Without Allo-HSCT or Rescue Cell Administration","timeFrame":"At Month 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenti-D Drug Product","deltaMin":90.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","France","Germany","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39383459","39383458","28976817"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02698579"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":32},"commonTop":["Thrombocytopenia","Anaemia","Neutropenia","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
