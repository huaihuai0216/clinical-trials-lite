(Kitov) is developing KIT-302, an oral fixed combination drug product (FCDP) consisting of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) celecoxib, as a \"convenience reformulation\" FCDP to facilitate and improve patient compliance with the once a day (qd) administration of its individual components, amlodipine and celecoxib.\n\nThe formulation of KIT-302 consists of amlodipine besylate and celecoxib co-formulated in a single immediate release tablet. However, for this study (KIT-302-03-02), commercial celecoxib capsules (Celebrex®) and commercial amlodipine besylate tablets (Norvasc®) were separately over-encapsulated (OE) and matched placebos were used to allow for blinding.\n\nKitov completed a phase 3 pivotal trial in subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension (KIT-302-03-01) demonstrating that the amlodipine + celecoxib combination was statistically non-inferior to amlodipine monotherapy with regard to reduction of blood pressure. Further, trends towards superior blood pressure lowering effects and improved renal function were observed for the combination. This study (KIT-302-03-02) was conducted to quantify the beneficial renovascular effects noted in the prior study in subjects with existing hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy.\n\nOn May 31, 2018, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KIT-302, under the brand name Consensi® (amlodipine and celecoxib) tablets \\[New Drug Application (NDA) 210045\\] for the following indication: \"patients for whom treatment with amlodipine for hypertension and celecoxib for osteoarthritis are appropriate. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.\"","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Average Daytime (9:00 to 21:00) Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (SBPday)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 14 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Amlodipine+Celecoxib","deltaMin":-8,"sd":8.24},{"arm":"Amlodipine+Placebo","deltaMin":-9.8,"sd":8.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.024"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":48},"commonTop":["Joint swelling","Headache","Oedema peripheral","Flushing","Feeling hot"]}}
