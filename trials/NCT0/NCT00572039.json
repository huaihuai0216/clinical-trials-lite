Patients who have uncontrolled glaucoma (continued visual field loss and increase in optic nerve cupping), diabetic retinopathy (due to macular edema), or cataracts for which surgery within 6 months is likely will not be eligible to participate. This information will be obtained from patients' ophthalmology charts and discussion with the patient's ophthalmologist.\n* Cognitive Impairment Criteria. Cognitive functioning will be evaluated by the Project Director during the telephone screen (see Chapter 9). Patients with cognitive impairment will not be eligible to participate.\n* Health Criteria. Patients with life-threatening illness (e.g., terminal cancer, need for oxygen) will not be eligible to participate. Information regarding heath status will be gleaned from patient's ophthalmology charts.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Targeted Vision Function (TVF)","description":"We identified and quantified the TVF goals that subjects valued but found difficult to achieve. To derive the TVF measure, at baseline subjects completed the Activities Inventory, a structured vision function questionnaire that asks patients to rate the value and difficulty of 48 vision function goals (e.g., daily meal preparation) and the tasks (e.g., seeing stove settings) that are required to achieve them. If a goal is important (range of 0 \\[not important\\]to 4 \\[very important\\]), the subject rates its \"difficulty\" (on a scale of 0 \\[not difficult\\] to 4 \\[impossible\\]). The average TVF score is the sum of the difficulty ratings of the (up to) 4 self-selected goals divided by the number of goals (from 1 to 4). Higher average scores indicate greater disability. At each outcome assessment subjects again rated the difficulty of the same targeted goals and the average TVF score was calculated.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.18","spread":".88"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.14","spread":".96"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Vision-related Quality of Life","description":"We administered the 25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionaire plus Supplement (NEI-VFQ).19 This version of the NEI VFQ consists of 39 items that assess self-reported vision function and vision-related QoL.
