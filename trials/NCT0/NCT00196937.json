Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals HPV-16/18 vaccine over 12 months, in women up to 55 years of age at study start. Approximately 660 study subjects will receive the HPV vaccine administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule. The study will be extended to assess long-term safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Seroconverted Subjects for Anti-human Papilloma Virus 16 (Anti-HPV-16) and Anti-human Papilloma Virus 18 (Anti-HPV-18) Antibodies, in Women 15 to 25 Years of Age and Women 26 to 45 Years of Age","timeFrame":"At Month 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix (15-25 Years) Group","deltaMin":191,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cervarix (26-45 Years) Group","deltaMin":164,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["Germany","Poland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19221517","19022320","21892005","21157180","25208608","24731816"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":229},"commonTop":["Pain","Redness","Fatigue","Myalgia","Headache"]}}
