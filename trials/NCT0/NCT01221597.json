Approximately 400 (267 AA4500 and 133 placebo) men will be randomized. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 21 days before the initial injection of study drug in the first treatment cycle.\n\nBefore dosing, subjects will be stratified by degree of penile curvature deformity (ie, 30º to 60º or 61º to 90º) and then randomized into two treatment groups to receive in a 2:1 ratio either AA4500 0.58 mg or placebo.\n\nIn this study, qualified subjects may receive up to four treatment cycles; each cycle will be separated by a period of 42 days (± 5 days). During each treatment cycle, subjects will receive two injections of study drug with at least 24 hours but not more than 72 hours between injections. After the final injection of each treatment cycle, the investigator or qualified designee will model the penile plaque in an attempt to stretch or elongate the plaque. If the subject's penile curvature is reduced to \\<15 degrees after the first, second, or third cycle of injections or if further treatment is not clinically indicated, subsequent treatment cycles will not be administered.\n\nFollowing the maximum of four treatment cycles, each subject will be followed for additional safety and efficacy assessments on Days 169 (± 7 days), 232 (± 7 days), 295 (± 7 days), 365 (± 7 days) (nominal weeks 24, 33, 42 and 52). Subjects randomized to placebo may receive open-label AA4500 treatment after completing this study as part of another protocol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change From Baseline in Penile Curvature","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AA4500","deltaMin":-37.6,"sd":30.29},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-21.3,"sd":29.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0005"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["United States","Australia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26199168"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":277},"commonTop":["Penile haematoma","Penile pain","Penile swelling","Injection site pain","Penile haemorrhage"]}}
