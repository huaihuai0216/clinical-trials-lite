Its role is in the control of blood sugar level by enhancing insulin secretion from the pancreas after eating a meal. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the role of GLP1R in the response to elevated glucagon concentrations.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Insulin Secretion Rate During Exendin-9,39 Infusion vs. Insulin Secretion Rate During Saline Infusion","timeFrame":"Area under the curve was quantified at the end of the Saline Study and at the end of the Exendin-9,39 study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Secretion During the Saline Study","deltaMin":191,"sd":23},{"arm":"Insulin Secretion During the Exendin-9,39 Study","deltaMin":171,"sd":19}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.02"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["Infusion line lost","Nausea"]}}
