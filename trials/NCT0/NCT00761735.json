primary and secondary sex characteristics. Female participants are evaluated for breast development and pubic hair distribution and male participants are evaluated for genital development and pubic hair distribution, based on a 5-stage ordinal scale ranging from TS 1 (prepubertal/preadolescent characteristics) to TS 5 (mature or adult characteristics). Mean ages for attaining each TS in the normal population have been previously established based on measuring correlating reproductive hormone levels, and are expressed in years as follows for females (F) and males (M): TS 1= 7.1 (F+M); TS 2= 10.5 (F), 12.1 (M); TS 3= 11.6 (F), 13.6 (M); TS 4=, 12.3 (F), 15.1 (M); TS 5= 14.5 (F), 18 (M).
