This trial will investigate whether effective medication therapy used in non-incarcerated populations will also be effective in incarcerated individuals. Empirical evidence demonstrates that starting treatment before release greatly increases the probability of successful outcome including reduced alcohol and drug use, increased employment rates, and reduced recidivism rates.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Opioid Use","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vivitrol (XR-NTX)","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"XR-NTX+PN","deltaMin":12,"sd":null},{"arm":"ETAU","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40342086","27282118"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":53},"commonTop":["Pain at injection site","Precipitated withdrawal","photophobia","Blurred vision"]}}
