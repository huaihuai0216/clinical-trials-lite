Note: Marijuana use is not considered an exclusion criterion for the study when elicited in participant screening, though it may be considered illicit in some locales.\n* Receipt of blood or plasma products or immunoglobulin (Ig), from 60 days before investigational product administration, or planned receipt through delivery, with 1 exception, Rho(D) immune globulin (eg, RhoGAM), which can be given at any time.\n* Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational RSV vaccine or planned. Note: Licensed COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines authorized for temporary or emergency use will not be prohibited during the course of this study.\n* Investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or Pfizer employees, including their family members, directly involved in the conduct of the study.\n* Participants who are breastfeeding at the time of enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria -Infant Participants:\n\no Infant who is a direct descendant (eg, child or grandchild) of the study personnel.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","genderBased":true,"genderDescription":"Healthy women ≤49 years of age who are between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation on the day of planned vaccination, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy, who are at no known increased risk for complications.","minimumAge":"0 Years","maximumAge":"49 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Infant Participants With Medically Attended Lower Respiratory Tract Illness (MA-LRTI) Cases Due to RSV Occurring Within 90 Days After Birth (Efficacy)","description":"Results are presented as confirmed by endpoint adjudication committee.
