Male and female patients with acute episodes of chronic rotator cuff syndrome and/or bursitis: tendinopathy of the supraspinatus tendon, bursitis, or partial degenerative tears of the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tendon (differentiation by ultrasonography)\n2. Age 40 to 65 years, inclusive\n3. Willing and able to understand and sign an approved informed consent form\n4. Not pregnant (as proven by negative pregnancy test before first study drug administration) or breast-feeding. Females of childbearing potential (including those less than one year post-menopausal) must agree to maintain reliable birth control throughout the study, i.e. an established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraception, female sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal exeresis, intrauterine device (\\[IUD\\] or coil or barrier method (e.g. diaphragm, cervical/vault cap) plus spermicidal cream/gel\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Calcifications in shoulder joint\n2. Complete rotator cuff tears\n3. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Previous treatment with NSAIDs is allowed, with a wash-out period of 1 week; paracetamol can be taken until 48 hours before baseline visit\n4. Corticoid therapy by mouth or by injection within the previous 3 months prior to screening\n5. Any contraindication for corticoid therapy\n6. Physical Therapy, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and shock-wave therapy (within 30 days prior to screening)\n7. Treatment with anticoagulants (except low-dose aspirin)\n8. Diabetic patients including borderline cases (glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin \\[HbA1c\\] \\> 7.0% at screening)\n9. Clinically significant shoulder joint deformities\n10. Major injury, including sports-related injury, to the shoulder within the past year\n11. Significant osteoarthritis of the shoulder\n12. Cervical spine disorder (that could confound the clinical assessment) that has been symptomatic and required active treatment within the past three months before screening\n13. Any active musculoskeletal disease that could confound the diagnosis/evaluation of the painful shoulder, any neurological aetiology of the pain, or any acute infection of the shoulder joint\n14. Any major surgery, arthroplasty, or arthroscopy in the signal shoulder within 6 months of screening or planned surgery within the duration of the study\n15. Prior history of any malignancy (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma) treated less than 2 years ago\n16. Patients with rheumatic polymyalgia\n17. Known or suspected allergies against one or any particular ingredients of Traumeel® S or of other study preparations\n18. Presence of serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological disease or other known systemic disease (like leukemia, tuberculosis, immune mediated diseases, multiple sclerosis, Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infections or other chronic virus-infections) that might interfere with the outcome of the study or the patient's ability to comply with study requirements.\n19. Presence of infections and/or skin diseases in the area of the injection site (including psoriasis)\n20. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (as judged of the investigator) at the screening visit\n21. Consumption of any investigational product within one month prior to the screening visit\n22. Patients who are likely to be non-compliant or uncooperative during the study, as judged by the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Abduction Rotation Pain VAS at Visit 5 (Day 22) (Traumeel® S Injections Versus Fortecortin) for Active External Rotation","description":"VAS is a 100 mm visual analogue scale for measuring the pain resulted from the adbuction and external rotation of the arm.
