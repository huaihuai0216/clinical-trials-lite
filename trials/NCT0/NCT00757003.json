Optimal patient selection, based on pathology and anatomy, is being defined. Technically successful implantation requires adequate assessment of pathology and anatomy, and development and execution of novel and delicate procedures that resolve the pathology while minimizing morbidity and mortality.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Technically Successful Implant","timeFrame":"Day 0 to Day 30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Arm - Placement of TAG Device","deltaMin":99,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":43,"n":100},"commonTop":["aortic diameter enlargement"]}}
