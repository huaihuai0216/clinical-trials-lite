Problems that may have great consequences for their quality of life. Several studies suggest that a supplement of the hormone melatonin (MLT) may have a beneficial effect on these symptoms/problems. This needs further investigation.\n\nAIM:\n\nTo investigate if a supplement of melatonin have an effect on a) fatigue (the primary outcome of the trial), b) the symptoms insomnia, appetite loss, depression and pain, and c) overall quality of life.\n\nMETHODS AND PATIENTS:\n\nThe trial takes place in the Department of Palliative Medicine, Bispebjerg Hospital, and 50 patients will participate. The participants have to be 18 years or above, have advanced cancer, and suffer from quite a bit or very much fatigue.\n\nThe study consists of two parts. In part I it is investigated if melatonin has a better effect than placebo on the outcomes mentioned above. This part is a consecutive, prospective, double blinded, randomized (MLT vs. placebo), cross-over study where the patients serve as their own control. In part II the effect of melatonin over time is investigated. Part II is a consecutive, prospective, open-label study.\n\nThe outcomes are assessed with weekly questionnaires (MFI-20 and EORTC QLQ-C15PAL) and a few daily diary questions.\n\nMelatonin has been used in several studies, and the general conclusion is that it is a safe substance with few adverse drug reactions.\n\nPERSPECTIVES:\n\nIf melatonin has the potential to alleviate fatigue and other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer and enhance the quality of life of these patients, this will be of benefit to many future patients. Trials such as this are important both nationally and internationally to develop an evidence-based palliative medicine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Fatigue as Measured by the Physical Fatigue Scale in the The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) (Smets EM, Garssen B, Bonke B, et al., J Psychosom Res 39:315-325, 1995)","timeFrame":"One week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Melatonin Then Placebo","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":15.9},{"arm":"Placebo Then Melatonin","deltaMin":-3.9,"sd":18.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Denmark"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26178160"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":34},"commonTop":[]}}
