Therefore, a GST score of 0 is representative of the population mean. Since GST is a composite of two endpoints, a negative ADCS-ADL23 score is used in deriving GST. Therefore, a lower score indicates improvement, and a higher score indicates worsening. There are no defined clinically relevant thresholds for this GST score.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.126","spread":"0.0683"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.208","spread":"0.0707"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog11) Change From Baseline","description":"The ADAS-Cog11 was designed to measure cognitive symptom change in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and consisted of 11 tasks.
