The type and amount of each narcotic administered were each converted to the morphine equivalent amount that would be orally administered to achieve the same event. This term is known as the oral morphine equivalent (OME). Narcotic usage was assessed between the group receiving transversus abdominis plane (TAP) nerve block compared to the group receiving the placebo control. The outcome is reported as the observed OME for each group.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"139.3","spread":"117.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"169.2","spread":"136.5"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Post-operative Pain Score","description":"Post-operative Pain Score is defined using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a patient-reported pain score based on viewing a graphic of a scale 0 to 10, and indicating pain level.

The results range for the pre-operative and post-operative questionnaire sets is 0 to 269 and 0 to 462, respectively. Because the baseline and post-operative domains are different, the BREAST-Q survey is not a measure of quality of life change over time. The Breast Q questionnaire was validated by Pusic, et al (citation provided). Higher scores for a domain represents better quality of life.
