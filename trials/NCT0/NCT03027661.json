This would be achieved using block randomization. The intervention would be performed after the patient is under general anesthesia, prior to starting the surgery. Patients would be consented in the office or preoperative area (before receiving sedatives). As far as the intervention itself, it would consist of injecting 5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine into the cervical stroma at 3 and 9 o'clock, which is standard technique for para-cervical block. The remainder of the procedure will then continue in a regular fashion. Alternatively, patients in the control group will be injected with 5 mL of normal saline. The surgeon would be blinded as to patient allocation. Research staff will have previously prepared the formulations (saline or bupivacaine) and have sent them to the operating room prior to beginning the procedure depending on assigned group. At the end of the case, pain will be assessed using a visual analogue scale with a range from 0 to 10 by one of the researches who will also be blinded to the group. This will be done at 30 and 60 minutes after surgical stop time. Additional pain control in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) will be standardized to all patients.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nPerforming a para-cervical block with local anesthetic prior to a laparoscopic hysterectomy significantly reduces pain after the procedure","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Reported on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at 30 Minutes Postoperative","timeFrame":"30 minutes post-operative stop time","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":5.7,"sd":2.8},{"arm":"Study Group","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":3.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26371370","25265887","26169246","25866297","18830553","12088961","14710057","20677480","27679246","24085642","20168127","22914480","30528725"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
