As blood flows across the artificial surfaces of the CPB circuit, platelets are activated and consumed. This activation results in a profound inflammatory reaction and need for transfusion. This reaction is intensified in younger, smaller patients undergoing longer, more complex open heart surgery. Nitric oxide is naturally released by vascular endothelial surfaces and acts as a signaling molecule which prevents platelet activation. The investigators hypothesize that the addition of the nitric oxide to the sweep gas of the oxygenator during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will replace this natural endothelial function and thus prevent platelet activation and consumption. The investigators plan to test this hypothesis with a pilot double blinded, randomized trial of 40 patients less than a year of age undergoing cardiac surgery requiring CPB.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Platelet Count","timeFrame":"From baseline to end of cardiopulmonary bypass (2-6 hours)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nitric Oxide","deltaMin":-221,"sd":107},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-242,"sd":114}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.55"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11722116","8614966","7877314","1371416","9315800","7504587","21050056","10809259","1591842","8945004","8607682","15821644","23228403","27686343","18249331","9390579","10468251","28274558"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":18},"commonTop":["Arrhythmia requiring temporary pacemaker","Sepsis","Chylothorax","Pulmonary hypertension","Seizure"]}}
