pain within the last year.\n* Patients who have suffered a recent, significant unexplained weight loss of more than 6 kg in the last 6 months.\n* Female patients of childbearing potential who, for the duration of the study, are either unwilling or unable to take adequate contraceptive precautions or are unwilling to be sexually abstinent.\n* Pregnancy or lactating mother.\n* Patients with a history and/or symptom profile suggestive of the following: any other gastrointestinal (GI) disease, erosive GERD (Los Angeles \\[LA\\] classification grades C-D), Barrett's oesophagus, acute peptic ulcer and/or ulcer complications, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastric carcinoma, pyloric stenosis, oesophageal or gastric surgery, intestinal obstruction, current pernicious anaemia, indication for H. pylori eradication therapy, known gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia or hematemesis) within the last 3 months, and severe diseases of other major body systems.\n* Patients who are observed at screening to have a hiatus hernia with a diameter which exceeds 3 cm.\n* Patients who have taken anti-cholinesterase drugs, traditional Chinese medicines for treating gastrointestinal disease, ulcerlmin or misoprostol preparations within 7 days prior to screening or throughout the study.\n* Patients who have taken PPIs during the 10 days prior to screening, prokinetics or H2 antagonists during the 5 days prior to screening or systemic glucocorticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (except for low dose aspirin which can be given for cardioprotection) on more than 3 consecutive days or PPI-based triple or quadruple therapy for eradication of H. pylori during the last 28 days.\n* Patients taking or requiring to take macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, azithromycin, from the day before screening.\n* Patients with difficulty in swallowing.\n* Patients with known hypophosphataemia, phenylketonuria or hypercalcaemia.\n* Patients with severe constipation, or history of intestinal obstruction.\n* In the opinion of the Investigator, patients with damaged heart or kidney function and patients who require a low sodium diet.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65

The parameters that constitute the score are number of reflux episodes, number of episodes longer than 5 minutes, longest reflux duration, total percentage of monitoring time with pH below 4, and the percentage of time with pH below 4 in an upright position and supine position, respectively. The DeMeester score is the sum of the scores calculated for each of the 6 parameters. A score more than 14.7 is considered abnormal acid reflux, scores between 14.7 and 100 are regarded as mild-to-moderate GERD, and a score greater than 100 is regarded as severe GERD.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.842","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"38.987","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["White blood cell count decreased"]}}}
