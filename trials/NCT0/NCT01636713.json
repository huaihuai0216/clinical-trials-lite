Other Respiratory Disorders: Known alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active lung infections (such as tuberculosis) and lung cancer are absolute exclusionary conditions. A subject, who in the opinion of the investigator has any other significant respiratory conditions in addition to COPD should be excluded.

Other Diseases/Abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled and/or a previous history of cancer in remission for \\< 5 years prior to Visit 1 (localized carcinoma of the skin that has been resected for cure is not exclusionary).\n5. Chest X-Ray: A chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan that reveals evidence of clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the presence of COPD. A chest X-ray must be taken at Visit 1 if a chest X-ray or CT scan is not available within 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n6. Contraindications: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as of narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the study physician contraindicates study participation or use of an inhaled anticholinergic.\n7. Hospitalization: Hospitalization for COPD or pneumonia within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n8. Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).\n9. 12-Lead ECG: An abnormal and significant ECG finding from the 12-lead ECG conducted at Visit 1, including the presence of a paced rhythm on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) which causes the underlying rhythm and ECG to be obscured. Investigators will be provided with ECG reviews conducted by a centralized independent cardiologist to assist in evaluation of subject eligibility.\n10. Screening Labs: Significantly abnormal finding from clinical chemistry and haematology tests at Visit 1.\n11. Medication Prior to Spirometry: Unable to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for the 4 hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit.\n12. Medications prior to Screening: List are provided in the protocol\n13. Oxygen: Use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) described as oxygen therapy prescribed for greater than 12 hours a day. As-needed oxygen use (i.e., less than 12 hours per day) is not exclusionary.\n14. Nebulized Therapy: Regular use (prescribed for use every day, not for as-needed use) of short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol/salbutamol) via nebulized therapy.\n15. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program: Participation in the acute phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. Subjects who are in the maintenance phase of a pulmonary rehabilitation program are not excluded.\n16. Drug or Alcohol Abuse: A known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years prior to Visit 1.\n17. Affiliation with Investigator Site: Is an investigator, sub-investigator, study coordinator, employee of a participating investigator or study site, or immediate family member of the aforementioned that is involved in this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline (BL) in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Day 169 (Week 24)","description":"FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second.
