Patients with autoimmune diseases;\n2. receiving immunosuppressive therapy that includes MMF at time of study enrollment;\n3. receiving immunosuppressive regimen that includes MMF at a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to enrollment. Patients can only be enrolled into the study if it is expected that treatment will continue at the same dose until study end (6-8 weeks after enrollment).\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. If applicable, GI symptoms assumed or known not to be caused by Mycophenolic acid (MPA) therapy (e.g. oral biphosphonates induced, infectious diarrhea);\n2. Women of child-bearing potential who are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant and/or lactating or who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception;\n3. Presence of psychiatric illness (i.e., schizophrenia, major depression) that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with study requirements;\n4. Current acute medical intervention or hospitalization;\n5.
