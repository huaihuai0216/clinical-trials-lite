This study will 1) determine the proportion of patients with autoimmune diseases who are experiencing any GI complaints under MMF-based immunosuppressive treatment and 2) assess if a switch from MMF to enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) results in improved GI and/or health-related quality of life outcomes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes in GI Symptom Severity After Conversion From Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 - 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium","deltaMin":2.28,"sd":1.13}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":111},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Vomiting","Nasopharyngitis","Abdominal distension"]}}
