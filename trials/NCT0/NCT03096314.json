We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Patients screened as vitamin D deficient (\\<20 ng/mL) were randomized. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"All-cause, All-location Mortality to Day 90","timeFrame":"90 days after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"High Dose Vitamin D Formulation","deltaMin":125,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":109,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.26"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":47,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31826336"],"seeAlso":["http://petalnet.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":690},"commonTop":["Nausea","Confidentiality","Hypercalcemia","Anemia Microcytic","Aspiration Pneumonia"]}}
