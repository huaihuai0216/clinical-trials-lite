Past or current evidence of hematuria due to urological/renal pathology or uninvestigated hematuria. Subjects with investigated hematuria may enter the study if urological/renal pathology has been ruled out to the satisfaction by the investigator (or subinvestigator).\n  6. Past or current history of bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy, positive result of urine cytology or uninvestigated suspicious urine cytology results at the Screening phase. Suspicious urine cytology abnormalities require that bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy has been ruled out to the satisfaction of the investigator according to local site practice.\n  7. An active genital infection, other than genital warts, either concurrently or within 4 weeks prior to Screening\n  8. Male with previous or current diagnosis of prostate cancer or a prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of \\>10 nanograms (ng)/mL at Screening.

Notes:\n\n  1. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read\n  2. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study.

The PVR measurement can be repeated once; the subject is to be excluded if the repeated measure is above 100 mL.\n* Subject has had urinary retention or an elevated PVR urine volume within 6 months of screening that has been treated with an intervention (such as catheterization). Voiding difficulties as a result of surgical procedures that resolved within 24 hours are not exclusionary.\n* Subject has a 24-hour total volume of urine voided \\>3000 mL of urine collected over 24 consecutive hours during the 3-day bladder diary collection period in the Screening phase.\n* Subject is currently participating in or has previously participated in another therapeutic study within 30 days prior to the start of the Screening phase.\n* Subject has any condition or situation which, in the investigator's (or subinvestigator's) opinion, puts the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the subject's participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1): Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 12 After the First Treatment","description":"Participants were instructed to enter data in a bladder diary over 3 consecutive days within a week prior to each scheduled visit (or within 28 days prior to Day 1), excluding the day of visit (this period was called the '3-day diary collection period').
