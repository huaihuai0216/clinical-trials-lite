However, there is not an agreement in the use of systemic antibiotics in patients with diabetes. The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of amoxicillin/metronidazole compared to clindamycin during non-surgical treatment of periodontitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nPatients and methods In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial, a total of 42 patients with chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes were included in a 24-months follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either amoxicillin/metronidazole or clindamycin every for 7 days. Clinical determinations (depth of probing, bleeding at the probe and plaque index) were performed to determine the extent and severity of periodontitis before and after the pharmacological treatment. The intra-group differences were calculated with Wilcoxon rank test. The inter-group differences were calculated with Mann-Whitney test. Sex, bacterial plaque, and bleed to the sounding were summarized using proportions and analyzed with the chi-square method. In all analyses, a P-value of \\<0.05 (two tailed) was considered statistically significant","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Probing Depth","timeFrame":"7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AMX-MET","deltaMin":0.44,"sd":0.27},{"arm":"Clindamycin","deltaMin":0.5,"sd":0.17}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":[]}}
