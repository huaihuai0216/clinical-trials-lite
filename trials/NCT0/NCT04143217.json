The sum of the transformed 5 items is divided by 5 to yield the raw \"Relationships\" subscale score (range: 0-100); the higher the subscale score, the better the Relationships. Post-baseline raw \"Relationships\" subscale scores are converted to a change from baseline score. A higher change from baseline \"Relationships\" subscale score (\\>0) represents a better outcome.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"64.7","spread":"19.78"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.9","spread":"18.09"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.7","spread":"19.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.2","spread":"21.57"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.8","spread":"20.34"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.7","spread":"19.93"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.1","spread":"22.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.7","spread":"20.36"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.3","spread":"19.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.8","spread":"19.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.9","spread":"20.37"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.4","spread":"20.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12.7","spread":"21.58"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.7","spread":"19.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.8","spread":"17.47"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.9","spread":"18.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.7","spread":"12.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.8","spread":"24.28"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":159},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Nausea","Headache","Fatigue","Corona virus infection"]}}}
