The investigators also seek to further examine the clinical benefits and adverse effects profiles of epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Chest Tube Drainage","timeFrame":"4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Epsilon-aminocaproic Acid (EACA)","deltaMin":200,"sd":375},{"arm":"Tranexamic Acid (TA)","deltaMin":225,"sd":400}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":56},"commonTop":[]}}
