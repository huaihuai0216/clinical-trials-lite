Most children take liquid iron medicine by mouth for at least 3 months. However, some children take longer to get better with this medicine. This study is trying to compare different ways of giving iron medicine to young children.\n\nFor young children in the US, the main cause of IDA is nutritional, or not having enough iron in the foods they eat. This often happens when kids drink too much cow milk and/or not eating enough foods that have a lot of iron. Iron deficiency is most common in children ages 1 to 4 years of age, during a time that is important for brain development. More severe and long-lasting IDA is associated with worse brain development outcomes. That is why researchers want to understand the fastest way for kids with IDA to get better.\n\nStandard treatment is oral iron medicine for 3 to 6 months. Many children do not take their iron medicine the full amount of time needed because of side effects like abdominal discomfort, nausea, constipation, and bad taste. Different factors can contribute to patients not completing their IDA therapy. Many families do not understand how important it is to treat IDA or do not have the motivation to continue the medication.\n\nThis study will offer different methods for treating IDA, including a different method to taking the oral iron therapy.\n\nThis new method gives oral iron by increasing a family's understanding and motivation. Another research study that interviewed families of young children with IDA found ways that helped the patients to continue their therapy. Using that information, a website called IRONCHILD was created to help motivate parents to get their children to continue the oral iron medicine.\n\nResearch studies that compare these different IDA treatment methods in young children are needed and could have benefits to short-term clinical and long-term brain development. However, we do not know whether families of young children with IDA will be willing to participate in this type of study that has different treatment methods (oral iron therapy and oral iron therapy with a web-based adherence intervention).\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to learn which of the two methods of care will be the best way for children with iron deficiency anemia to receive therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Eligible Patients Enrolled","timeFrame":"Baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Oral Iron Therapy","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Oral Iron Therapy Plus IRONCHILD Web-based Intervention","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1},"commonTop":["Emesis, Constipation"]}}
