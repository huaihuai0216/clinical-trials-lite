A timed walk rank was created to take into account the use of walking aids.\n\nTimed walk rank was calculated by ranking the time to walk 10 meters over all patients and visits, in the following order (highest/worst score to lowest/best score): unable to walk; able to walk, but not able to complete 10 meters (ranked on distance walked and time taken); able to walk 10 meters with a bilateral aid; able to walk 10 meters with a unilateral aid; able to walk 10 meters unaided (all ranked on time taken).\n\nDecrease in score means improvement. All evaluable patients were ranked on the time taken. There is no specific range for the rank scores.
