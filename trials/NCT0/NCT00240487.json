The study examines whether nitric oxide (NO) treatment impacts the the P:F ratio (arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) divided by fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in patients with ARDS. The goal of the study is to evaluate whether the order of NO therapy will have any effect on response, and evaluate the characteristics of patients who respond to NO compared to those who do not.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean PaO2/FiO2 Ratio","timeFrame":"8 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Nitric Oxide Treatment","deltaMin":115.6,"sd":40.6},{"arm":"Delayed Nitric Oxide Treatment","deltaMin":115.9,"sd":40}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":">0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Month","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":[]}}
