Any clinically significant abnormality, including any finding(s) from the physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or laboratory test at the end-of-treatment visit of Studies KAR-007 or KAR-009 that the investigator, in consultation with the medical monitor, would consider to jeopardize the safety of the subject.\n3.
