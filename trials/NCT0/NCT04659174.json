In this OLE study, all subjects will receive KarXT (a fixed combination of xanomeline 125 mg and trospium chloride 30 mg twice daily \\[BID\\]) for up to 52 weeks regardless of treatment assignment in the preceding Phase 3 acute study. The primary objective of the study is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of KarXT in subjects with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. The secondary objective of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy and monitor trough concentrations of xanomeline and trospium after administration of KarXT.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"From first dose to end of study (Up to approximately 53 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"KarXT Arm A","deltaMin":36,"sd":null},{"arm":"KarXT Arm B","deltaMin":45,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":44,"countries":["United States","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":68},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dyspepsia","Vomiting","Weight increased","Dry mouth"]}}
