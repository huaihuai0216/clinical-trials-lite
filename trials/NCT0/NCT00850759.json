One limitation to existing interventions is that they fail to provide children with the repeated practice needed to develop the complex perceptual and cognitive skills required for safe pedestrian activity.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) offers a highly promising technique to train children in pedestrian safety skills. VR permits repeated unsupervised practice without risk of injury; automated feedback to children on success or failure in crossings; adjustment of traffic density and speed to match children's skill level; and an appealing and fun environment for training. The proposed research is designed to test the efficacy of virtual reality as a tool to train child pedestrians in safe street-crossing behavior.\n\nA randomized controlled trial will be conducted with four equal-sized groups of children ages 7-8 (total N = 240). One group will receive training in an interactive and immersive virtual pedestrian environment. The virtual environment, already developed, has been demonstrated to have face, construct, and convergent validity. The second group will receive pedestrian safety training via video and computer strategies that are most widely used in American schools today. The third group will receive what is judged to be the most efficacious treatment currently available, individualized behavioral training at streetside locations. The fourth and final group will serve as a no-contact control group. All participants in all groups will be exposed to a range of field- and laboratory-based measures of pedestrian skill during baseline and post-intervention visits, as well as during a six-month follow-up assessment. Primary analyses will be conducted through linear mixed models designed to test change over time in the four intervention groups. We hypothesize all children in active learning groups will increase pedestrian safety skills, but the largest increase will be among children in the virtual reality group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Street-crossing Ability","timeFrame":"post-training and again 6 months later","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Virtual Reality","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":1.6},{"arm":"Streetside Training","deltaMin":2.3,"sd":1.2},{"arm":"Computer and Video","deltaMin":2.6,"sd":1.6},{"arm":"No-contact Control","deltaMin":3,"sd":1.6}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20179024","23066380"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":59},"commonTop":[]}}
