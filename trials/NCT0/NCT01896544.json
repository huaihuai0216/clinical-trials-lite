Though the severity of illness may vary, every year, approximately 1.6 million Americans are treated for sepsis. Even with timely interventions, anywhere from 16% to \\>80% of patients with sepsis will not survive. Immune dysfunction is thought to play a critical role in the ability for infections to evolve into sepsis and to eventually lead to death. Recently, vitamin D has been identified as a key regulator of the immune system. While it remains unclear whether optimizing vitamin D status may improve outcomes in sepsis, little is known about the effects of vitamin D supplementation in patients with severe infections. As such, our goal is to study whether high doses of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) can improve vitamin D status and boost certain aspects of the immune system in patients with sepsis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Vitamin D Status 5 Days Following Supplementation With Cholecalciferol","timeFrame":"Patients will be followed between the onset of suspected sepsis and for an average duration of 7 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cholecalciferol Dose I","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cholecalciferol Dose II","deltaMin":17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
