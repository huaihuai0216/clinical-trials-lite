Male or female at least 18 years of age and of any race\n2. In good general health\n3. Read, understand and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF)\n4. If female of child-bearing potential, are willing to use an acceptable method of contraception to prevent pregnancy (i.e. oral contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm, condom, abstinence, bilateral tubal ligation, or are in a monogamous relationship with a partner who has had a vasectomy)\n5. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, must have a negative Urine Pregnancy Test (UPT) on Treatment Day prior to any applications of the study products\n6. Screening Day Baseline microbial counts are at least 3.11 colony forming units (CFU)/cm2 bilaterally from the skin of the abdomen, and 5.00 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/cm2 bilaterally from the skin of the groin (not applicable for Neutralization study)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Exposure of test sites to antimicrobial agents, medicated soaps, medicated shampoos, or medicated lotions, use of biocide-treated pools or hot tubs, use of tanning beds, or sunbathing during the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period (7-day for Neutralization study)\n2. Exposure of the test sites to strong detergents, solvents, or other irritants during the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period (7-day for Neutralization study)\n3. Wear fabric softener, bug repellent or UV-treated clothing during the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period (7-day for Neutralization study)\n4. Receive an irritation score of 1 (any redness, swelling, rash, or dryness present at any treatment area) for any individual skin condition prior to the Screening Day baseline or Treatment Day baseline sample collection or Neutralization study\n5. Use of systemic or topical antibiotic medications, steroid medications (other than for hormonal contraception or post-menopausal reasons), or any other product known to affect the normal microbial flora of the skin during the 14-day washout conditioning period and during the test period (7-day for Neutralization study)\n6. Known allergies or sensitivities to vinyl, latex (rubber), alcohols, metals, inks, or tape adhesives, or to common antibacterial agents found in soaps, lotions, or ointments, particularly isopropyl alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate\n7. A medical diagnosis of a physical condition, such as a current or recent severe illness, asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, an organ transplant, mitral valve prolapses, congenital heart disease, internal prostheses, or any immunocompromised conditions such as AIDS (or HIV positive)\n8. Pregnancy, plans to become pregnant within the washout and test periods of the study, or nursing a child\n9. Any tattoos or scars within 2\" (5.08 cm) of the test sites\n10. Dermatoses, cuts, lesions, active skin rashes, or breaks or other skin disorders within 6\" on or around the test sites\n11. A currently active skin disease or inflammatory skin condition (for example, contact dermatitis) anywhere on the body that, in the opinion of the Consulting Physician or PI, would compromise subject safety or study integrity\n12. Showering, bathing, or swimming within the 72-hour period prior to sampling for baseline screening, Treatment Day, and throughout the test period (not applicable for Neutralization study)\n13. Participation in another clinical study in the past 30 days or current participation in another clinical study at time of signing informed consent\n14. Any medical condition or use of any medications that, in the opinion of the PI, should preclude participation\n15. Unwillingness to fulfill the performance requirements of the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bacterial Microflora on the Inguinal Area","description":"Bacterial microflora (log10) will be measured via cup scrub method after administration of the intervention","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.92","spread":"1.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.69","spread":"1.56"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.94","spread":"1.60"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bacterial Microflora on the Inguinal Area","description":"Bacterial microflora (log10) will be measured via cup scrub method after administration of the intervention","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.07","spread":"1.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.04","spread":"1.61"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.17","spread":"1.57"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bacterial Microflora on the Inguinal Area","description":"Bacterial microflora (log10) will be measured via cup scrub method after administration of the intervention","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.30","spread":"1.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.57","spread":"1.62"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.28","spread":"1.53"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bacterial Microflora on the Abdomen","description":"Bacterial microflora (log10) will be measured via cup scrub method after administration of the intervention","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.09","spread":"0.76"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.95","spread":"1.11"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-2.85","spread":"1.08"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bacterial Microflora on the Abdomen","description":"Bacterial microflora (log10) will be measured via cup scrub method after administration of the intervention","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.15","spread":"0.85"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.97","spread":"1.06"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.01","spread":"0.82"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Bacterial Microflora on the Abdomen","description":"Bacterial microflora (log10) will be measured via cup scrub method after administration of the intervention","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.19","spread":"0.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.27","spread":"0.95"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.18","spread":"0.91"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":57},"commonTop":[]}}}
