Patients will be randomized to dabigatran or acetylsalicyclic acid (ASA) (1:1 ratio) and have visits every three months. The study doctor may prescribe blinded concomitant ASA for pts with coronary artery disease but this is not mandatory. All Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), outcome events will be recorded. The trial will conclude when the required number of stroke events are positively adjudicated which is estimated to take 3 years (including 2.5 years of enrollment).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Adjudicated Recurrent Stroke","timeFrame":"From randomisation until full follow up period, approximately 43 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dabigatran Etexilate 110 or 150 Milligram (mg)","deltaMin":4.09,"sd":null},{"arm":"Acetylsalicylic Acid, Aspirin (ASA) 100 mg","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1028"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":569,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Japan","Malaysia","Mexico","New Zealand","Peru","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","Slovakia","Slovenia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35656979","35538232","34649459","33588594","33504190","32404035","31091372"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":724,"n":2676},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Atrial fibrillation"]}}
