This is called atrial fibrillation.\n\nAtrial fibrillation goes along with blood clots that may cause mainly strokes and less often other diseases, such as a heart attack. Some patients with atrial fibrillation have other heart disease, such as heart valves that may need to be replaced using catheters.\n\nOften doctors give patients drugs that reduce those blood clots. These are either vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or direct anticoagulants, such as edoxaban. In these patients, it is unclear which of the drugs is better for reducing stroke without increasing severe bleedings.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Experienced Net Adverse Clinical Events (Adjudicated Data) Based on ISTH Criteria in Participants Taking Edoxaban vs VKA","timeFrame":"Baseline through study completion, up to 36 months post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Edoxaban","deltaMin":170,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA)","deltaMin":157,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0141"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":230,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Poland","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40371611","34449183","34274293","30172099"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":388,"n":693},"commonTop":["Cardiac failure","Urinary tract infection","Anaemia","Epistaxis","Pneumonia"]}}
