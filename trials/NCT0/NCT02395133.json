Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during this study\n5. Women unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential\\* and sexually active. Adequate birth control is defined as agreement to consistently practice an effective and accepted method of contraception, whenever engaging in heterosexual intercourse, throughout the duration of the study and for 120 days after last dose of study drug. These include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, or double barrier contraception (e.g, condom + diaphragm), or a male partner with documented vasectomy. Additional requirements for acceptable contraception may apply in certain countries, based on local regulations. Investigators in these countries will be notified accordingly in a protocol clarification letter.\n\n(\\*For females, menopause is defined as at least 12 consecutive months without menses; if in question, a follicle stimulating hormone level of \\>= 25 milli units per milliliter (mU/mL) must be documented. Hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation must be documented, as applicable; if documented, women with these conditions are not required to use additional contraception).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Difference Between Current Study Baseline and Week 36 in Percent Change in EASI From Parent Study Baseline (NCT02277743 and NCT02277769)","description":"The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities.
