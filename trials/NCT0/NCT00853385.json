The study is intended to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of CP 690,550 when dosed 5 mg and 10 mg twice a day on background methotrexate in adult patients with moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is intended to confirm the benefits of CP-690,550 in improving signs and symptoms and physical function that were observed in Rheumatoid Arthritis. An active comparator, adalimumab, is also included.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response at Month 6","timeFrame":"Month 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CP-690,550 5 mg","deltaMin":51.53,"sd":null},{"arm":"CP-690,550 10 mg","deltaMin":52.55,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":28.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Adalimumab","deltaMin":47.24,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0007"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":125,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","Costa Rica","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Dominican Republic","Finland","Germany","Mexico","Philippines","Poland","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39192350","38958913","37925660","37453736","36931693","36814062","36601090","36600185","36526796","35577477","35382883","34921355","34870800","34636000","33127856","33059710","32816215","30177460","29949132","29696833","28143815","27334658","26275429","25047021","22873531"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A3921064&StudyName=A%20Phase%203%20Study%20Comparing%202%20Doses%20Of%20CP-690%2C550%20And%20The%20Active%20Comparator%2C%20Humira%20%28adalimumab%29%20Vs.%20Placebo%20For%20Treatment%20Of%20Rh"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":204},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Bronchitis","Headache"]}}
