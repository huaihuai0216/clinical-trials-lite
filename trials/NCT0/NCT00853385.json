functioning.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"39.77","spread":"10.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"38.74","spread":"11.31"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"38.94","spread":"9.81"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"38.59","spread":"10.08"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"38.75","spread":"10.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41.66","spread":"9.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.55","spread":"10.15"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"41.77","spread":"8.36"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"39.75","spread":"9.20"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"41.12","spread":"9.44"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.52","spread":"10.65"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.42","spread":"9.96"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44.55","spread":"9.82"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"42.76","spread":"9.78"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"42.03","spread":"11.55"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.45","spread":"9.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"42.75","spread":"9.50"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44.68","spread":"8.86"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"42.26","spread":"7.77"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"41.81","spread":"9.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"44.47","spread":"10.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45.42","spread":"10.44"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44.83","spread":"10.70"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"43.70","spread":"10.16"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"43.44","spread":"12.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"39.98","spread":"11.99"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.58","spread":"12.07"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"39.84","spread":"11.40"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"41.46","spread":"11.81"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"40.07","spread":"12.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"47.76","spread":"9.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48.69","spread":"9.68"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"47.80","spread":"8.94"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"46.41","spread":"10.03"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"46.11","spread":"10.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41.15","spread":"9.79"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"41.34","spread":"9.20"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"41.39","spread":"8.54"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"40.57","spread":"9.34"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"40.12","spread":"9.58"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"44.79","spread":"10.76"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"46.55","spread":"10.52"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"45.31","spread":"9.75"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"45.23","spread":"11.22"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"44.08","spread":"11.45"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41.55","spread":"8.57"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.32","spread":"9.44"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"41.65","spread":"8.20"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"39.73","spread":"7.73"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"40.35","spread":"8.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40.16","spread":"10.25"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.34","spread":"11.59"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"39.24","spread":"10.07"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"40.42","spread":"9.84"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"39.21","spread":"10.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41.15","spread":"9.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"42.34","spread":"10.32"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"40.16","spread":"8.73"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"41.18","spread":"9.30"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"41.07","spread":"9.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.14","spread":"10.46"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.07","spread":"10.44"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"43.78","spread":"9.97"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"44.94","spread":"9.78"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"42.96","spread":"10.92"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"43.44","spread":"9.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.02","spread":"10.02"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"43.90","spread":"8.28"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"43.18","spread":"7.76"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"42.73","spread":"9.77"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"44.83","spread":"10.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45.06","spread":"10.49"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44.09","spread":"9.20"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"45.28","spread":"10.94"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"44.23","spread":"10.93"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40.18","spread":"11.46"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"42.25","spread":"11.68"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"40.23","spread":"10.79"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"41.03","spread":"12.67"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"39.89","spread":"11.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"47.60","spread":"9.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"49.12","spread":"9.95"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"47.31","spread":"9.13"},{"groupId"

Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range\\* 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34.62","spread":"18.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.64","spread":"18.42"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"34.69","spread":"19.10"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"34.68","spread":"21.32"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"35.72","spread":"20.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34.86","spread":"17.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.49","spread":"17.90"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"36.00","spread":"17.63"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"35.38","spread":"20.40"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"36.52","spread":"19.68"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"51.21","spread":"26.96"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"57.20","spread":"28.48"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"54.29","spread":"27.84"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"50.00","spread":"30.18"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"49.81","spread":"27.20"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.78","spread":"19.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.13","spread":"20.67"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"21.22","spread":"22.14"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"18.38","spread":"18.49"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"17.48","spread":"21.79"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34.82","spread":"23.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32.32","spread":"22.41"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"37.12","spread":"23.55"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"34.86","spread":"23.94"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"37.36","spread":"25.19"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.78","spread":"1.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.03","spread":"1.47"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6.86","spread":"1.34"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"6.84","spread":"1.34"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"6.72","spread":"1.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.78","spread":"29.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.53","spread":"27.29"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"27.50","spread":"22.83"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"32.43","spread":"26.81"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"34.47","spread":"30.01"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"29.41","spread":"18.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.07","spread":"19.36"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"32.38","spread":"17.53"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"29.37","spread":"22.25"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"30.00","spread":"21.21"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Optimal Sleep Assessed Using Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at Baseline, Month 1, 3 and 6","description":"MOS-SS: participant-rated 12 item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week.
