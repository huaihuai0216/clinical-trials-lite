The five-item measure has 1 question assessing each of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and 5 levels for each dimension including 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems and 5=extreme problems. The health state is defined by combining the levels of answers from each of the 5 questions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. Health state 5 digit code is translated into utility score, which is valued up to 1 (perfect health) with lower values meaning worse state. EQ-5D-5L utility score ranges from -0.281 to 1.
