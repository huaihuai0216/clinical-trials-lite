The size of each baseline AK lesion was recorded by measuring the two largest perpendicular diameters. To describe irregular lesions (ellipsoidal) investigators measured the major and minor axis. Both axes had to be above the minimum of 0.5 cm and less than 1.5 cm.\n* The subjects were free of any significant physical abnormalities (e.g., tattoos, dermatoses) in the potential treatment area that might cause difficulty with examination or final evaluation.\n* The subjects were willing to stop using moisturizers and any other topical treatments with anti-aging products, vitamin A, vitamin C, and/or vitamin E containing ointments and creams, and green tea preparations during the study within the treatment area. Sunscreens were allowed, but were not to be applied in the treatment area within approximately 24 hours before a clinical visit with lesion count.\n* Women of childbearing potential were only allowed to participate in this study, if they used a highly effective method of contraception and had a negative serum pregnancy test.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Had known hypersensitivity to 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA).\n* Were subjects under immunosuppressive therapy.\n* Suffered from porphyria.\n* Showed hypersensitivity to porphyrins.\n* Suffered from photodermatoses.\n* Had inherited or acquired coagulation defects.\n* Had received medication with hypericin or systemically acting drugs with phototoxic or photoallergic potential such as psoralens, tetracyclines, nalidixic acid, furosemide, amiodarone, phenothiazines, quinolones, fibrates, or phytotherapy with St. John's wort, arnica, or valerian or topically applied phototoxic substances like tar, pitch, psoralens or some dyes like thiazide, methylene blue, toluidine blue, eosine, Bengal rose, acridine within 8 weeks prior to treatment with study drug and photodynamic therapy (PDT).\n* Had evidence of clinically significant, unstable medical conditions such as\n\n  * metastatic tumor or tumor with high probability of metastatic spread\n  * cardiovascular (NYHA class III, IV)\n  * immunosuppressive\n  * hematological, hepatic, renal, neurological, endocrine\n  * collagen-vascular\n  * gastrointestinal\n* Had currently other malignant or benign tumors of the skin within the treatment area (e.g., malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, invasive squamous cell carcinoma).\n* Used any topical treatment in the treatment area within 12 weeks before PDT treatment with BF-200 ALA; biopsy taken at the screening visit was allowed.\n* Used topical treatment with ALA or MAL (methyl-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride) outside the treatment area during participation in the study.\n* Systemic treatments of one of the following within the designated period before\n\nPDT with BF-200 ALA:\n\n* Interferon - 6 weeks\n* Immunomodulators or immunosuppressive therapies - 10 weeks\n* Cytotoxic drugs - 6 months\n* Investigational drugs - 8 weeks\n* Drugs known to have major organ toxicity - 8 weeks\n* Corticosteroids (oral or injectable) - 6 weeks\n* Inhaled corticosteroids (\\>1200 µg/day for beclomethasone, or \\>600 µg/day for fluticasone) - 4 weeks\n* Methyl-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride or ALA - 12 weeks\n* Known allergy against polysorbate 80, caprylic/capric acid triglycerides, isopropyl alcohol, disodium phosphate dihydrate, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, propylene glycol; sodium benzoate.\n* Were known to be pregnant or lactating (currently or within the past 3 months).\n* Had any dermatological disease in the treatment area or surrounding area that could be exacerbated by treatment with topical ALA or caused difficulty with examination (e.g. psoriasis, eczema).\n* Showed cornu cutaneum like alterations of the skin in the face or on the bald scalp (target area).\n* Were currently or within the past 8 weeks participating in another clinical study.\n* Had active chemical dependency or alcoholism as assessed by the investigator.\n* Confirmed diagnosis of HIV.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Total Patient Clearance Rate 12 Weeks After the Last Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)","description":"AK clearance rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with complete remission of all AK lesions in the target area(s) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT (12 weeks after the 1st PDT or 12 weeks after the 2nd PDT in case of retreatment).","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"66.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Total Patient Clearance Rate 12 Weeks After the Last Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)","description":"AK clearance rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with complete remission of all AK lesions in the target area(s) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT (12 weeks after the 1st PDT or 12 weeks after the 2nd PDT in case of retreatment).","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"63.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Total Patient Clearance Rate Treated With Narrow Spectrum Lamp 12 Weeks After the Last Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)","description":"AK clearance rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with complete remission of all AK lesions in the target area(s) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT (12 weeks after the 1st PDT or 12 weeks after the 2nd PDT in case of retreatment).\n\nAnalysis was for the subgroup: treated by narrow spectrum lamps only \\[n=15 (vehicle), n= 31 (BF-200 ALA)\\]","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"87.1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Total Patient Clearance Rate Treated With Narrow Spectrum Lamp 12 Weeks After the Last Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)","description":"AK clearance rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with complete remission of all AK lesions in the target area(s) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT (12 weeks after the 1st PDT or 12 weeks after the 2nd PDT in case of retreatment).\n\nAnalysis was for the subgroup: treated by narrow spectrum lamps only \\[n=13 (vehicle), n= 28 (BF-200 ALA)\\]","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"96.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of AK Lesions Showing Complete Remission 12 Weeks After the Last PDT","description":"Percentage of individual lesions completely cleared and with no adherent scaling plaques of AK that were visible any longer 12 weeks after the last PDT (12 weeks after the 1st PDT or 12 weeks after the 2nd PDT in case of retreatment);
