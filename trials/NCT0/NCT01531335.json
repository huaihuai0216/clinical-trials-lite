Patients will be randomized to standard care (25 kcal per kg) or to hypocaloric nutrition (15 kcal per kg). The main outcome will be the SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score. The hypothesis is that hypocaloric hyperproteic diet decreases the incidence of organic failure in these patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) Score","timeFrame":"48 hours since nutritional regime starts","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard Care","deltaMin":0.7,"sd":2.8},{"arm":"Hypocaloric Hyperproteic Nutrition","deltaMin":1.7,"sd":1.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Colombia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://puj-portal.javeriana.edu.co/portal/page/portal/PORTAL_VERSION_2009_2010/es_inicio"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}
