This Phase III study will be an open-label, single-arm, repeat-dose, multi-centre study of mepolizumab liquid drug product in a safety syringe (100 milligrams \\[mg\\]) administered subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks (3 doses) in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. Subjects will receive 100 mg mepolizumab SC as a single injection that is self-administered in the thigh, abdomen or administered in the upper arm (caregiver only). Each subject will participate in the study for up to 18 weeks including pre-screening visit, a screening visit and a 12-week treatment period which concludes with end of study assessments (Visit 5) 4 weeks after the last dose of mepolizumab. Approximately 55 Subjects will be enrolled in the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Their Observed Third Dose at Week 8","timeFrame":"Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mepolizumab Liquid Safety Syringe","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Canada","Netherlands","Russia","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31017022"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":56},"commonTop":["Viral upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
