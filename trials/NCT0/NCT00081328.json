therapy.\n* Patient on a thiazolidinedione (TZD) within the last 12 weeks.\n* Patient on non-study diabetes medications within the past 6 weeks.\n* Patient on inhaled steroids at dose above 1000 mcg daily Flovent equivalent.\n* Patient on a course of oral steroids within the last 60 days or on oral steroids more than 20 days during the past year.\n* Patient on medication(s) that are known to affect insulin sensitivity or secretion within the last 30 days.\n* Patient on medication(s) that are known to cause weight gain within the last 30 days.\n* Patient on any weight-loss medication(s) within the last 30 days.\n* Patient on medication(s) known to affect the metabolism of study drug.\n* Inability to comprehend the lowest grade level at which lifestyle intervention materials are
