The secondary aims are to:\n\n* compare and evaluate the safety of the three treatment arms;\n* compare the effects of the three treatments on the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with regards to beta cell function and insulin resistance, body composition, nutrition, physical activity and aerobic fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, microvascular complications, quality of life, and psychological outcomes;\n* evaluate the influence of individual and family behaviors on treatment response; and\n* compare the relative cost effectiveness of the three treatment arms.\n\nThe three treatment regimens are: (1) metformin alone, (2) metformin plus rosiglitazone, and (3) metformin plus an intensive lifestyle intervention called the TODAY Lifestyle Program (TLP). The study recruits patients over a three-year period and follows patients for a minimum of two years. Patients are randomized within two years of the diagnosis of T2D.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Failure (Loss of Glycemic Control)","timeFrame":"Study duration - 2 years to 6.5 years of follow up from randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1 Metformin Alone","deltaMin":120,"sd":null},{"arm":"2 Metformin + Rosliglitazone","deltaMin":90,"sd":null},{"arm":"3 Metformin + Lifestyle Program","deltaMin":109,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17448130","19774104","19244566","19823189","24955003","25389367","28486851","31081852","31119838","20519658","20962021","21357794","21836107","22369102","22332798","22540912","23400602","23438494","23704672","23704673","23704674","23704675","23704676","23704677","24450390","24702733","24948348","25468310","25784663","26047470","25702853","27057209","26537182","26531295","26577415","26628417","25690268","26859798","27803118","27161901","27426901","27352955","27499218","28378429","28664624","29157731","29246363","29758564","29146120","29398050","29532078","29427697","29697830","29936086","30455329","30833375","30967435","31167889","31418516","31501226","31685489","31809265","31886931","32064729","32501612","33071178","40566988","39706874","39432369","38421647","37434027","36150365","35149207","35123868","35015056","34542729","32778555","32498621","24548045"],"seeAlso":["https://today.bsc.gwu.edu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":42,"n":232},"commonTop":["Infection requiring medical attention","Gastrointestinal symptoms","Hyperglycemia symptoms","Skin rash on physical examination","Muscle ache or pain"]}}
