Inclusion criteria\n\n• Male or female\n\n* ≥16 years of age\n* SARS-CoV-2 infection (clinically suspected+ or laboratory confirmed\\*).\n* Admitted to hospital as in-patient less than 96 hours prior to randomisation\\^\n* Illness of any duration, and at least one of the following:\n\n  * Radiographic infiltrates by imaging (e.g. chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan) OR\n  * Evidence of rales/crackles on physical examination OR\n  * Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤94% on room air prior to randomization OR\n  * Requiring supplemental oxygen. OR\n  * Lymphocyte count \\<1 x 109 cells per litre (L)\n* Participant (or legally authorized representative) provides written informed consent\n* Able to take oral medication\n* Participant (or legally authorised representative) understands and agrees to comply with planned trial procedures.\n\n  * Laboratory-confirmed: SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or other commercial or public health assay in any specimen \\< 96 hours prior to randomization.\n\n    * Clinically suspected: in general, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be suspected when a patient presents with (i) typical symptoms (e.g. influenza-like illness with fever and muscle pain, or respiratory illness with cough and shortness of breath); and (ii) compatible chest X-ray findings (consolidation or ground-glass shadowing); and (iii) alternative causes have been considered unlikely or excluded (e.g. heart failure, influenza). However, the diagnosis remains a clinical one based on the opinion of the managing doctor\n\n      * Where a patient has been admitted to hospital for a non COVID-19 reason and develops COVID-19 symptoms whilst an in-patient, randomisation may occur up to 96 hours from onset of symptoms.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) \\> 5 times the upper limit of normal, result within 72 hours of randomization (the result closest to randomization should be used if several results are available).\n* History of severe liver disease\n* Stage 4 severe chronic kidney disease or requiring dialysis (i.e. estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate \\< 30), result within 72 hours of randomization (the result closest to randomization should be used if several results are available)\n* Absolute neutrophil count less than 1.0 x 109 cells per L within 72 hours of randomization (the result closest to randomization should be used if several results are available)\n* Current treatments with potent Cyp3A4 inducers/inhibitors (e.g Itraconazole, Ketoconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, phenytoin or rifampicin)\n* HIV treatments - current treatment with protease/integrase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors\\*\n* Pregnant or breast feeding.\n* Anticipated transfer to another hospital which is not a trial site within 24 hours.\n* Allergy to Brensocatib\n* Use of any investigational drug within five times of the elimination half-life after the last trial dose or within 30 days, whichever is longer. Co-enrolment with COVID-19 trials is allowed as per co-enrolment agreements and/or individual decision by the Chief Investigator.\n\nWomen of child-bearing potential must be willing to have pregnancy testing prior to trial entry.\n\n\\*The Liverpool HIV checker (https://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/checker) should be used to check for any HIV drug interactions. Simvastatin could be used as a surrogate for Brensocatib as it metabolised similarly by CYP 3A4 pathway.\n\n\\-","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Comparison of Participant Clinical Status Between Treatment Arms","description":"To determine the participant clinical status on a 7-point ordinal scale, minimum value 1, maximum value 7.

Neutrophil elastase activity was subsequently measured by cleavage of the specific fluorogenic substrate MeOSuc-AAPV-AMC. The stimulated elastase activity was calculated by subtracting the plasma elastase activity following incubation with zymosan stimulation from the elastase activity after incubation with buffer alone.
