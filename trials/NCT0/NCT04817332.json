There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and no therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the potential of Brensocatib (INS1007) as a novel host directed therapy for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The investigators hypothesise that Brensocatib, by blocking damaging neutrophil proteases, will reduce the incidence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19, thereby resulting in improved clinical outcomes at day 15 and day 29, fewer days dependent on oxygen or mechanical ventilation, and shorter length of hospital stay.\n\nHigh rates of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and overwhelming intensive care unit capacity has been the major issue contributing to excess deaths in Italy and Spain during the pandemic and is likely to be a major issue in other countries such as the United Kingdom in the coming weeks. Treatments that could prevent the requirement for mechanical ventilation or shorten the duration of ICU stay by reducing the severity of ARDS are therefore the number 1 target for COVID19 therapy.\n\nThe investigators recently conducted a large phase 2 study of Brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis designed to test if treatment with Brensocatib could reduce infective exacerbations and reduce neutrophil elastase activity in the lung in bronchiectasis patients. The study met its primary endpoint of time to first exacerbation and key secondary endpoint of the frequency of exacerbations as well as showing marked reductions in neutrophil elastase concentrations in sputum.\n\nParticipants will be randomised to receive Brensocatib or placebo 25mg orally once daily for 28 days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Comparison of Participant Clinical Status Between Treatment Arms","timeFrame":"Up to 29 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Brensocatib","deltaMin":28,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":40,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.008"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":40,"n":192},"commonTop":["Rash","Dizziness","Dyspepsia","Nausea","Arthralgia"]}}
