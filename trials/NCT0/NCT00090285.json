In the 7-month Base Study participants received randomly assigned qHPV vaccine or placebo at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. Base Study follow-up continued through Month 36. In Extension 1 (EXT1), participants who received placebo or an incomplete qHPV vaccine regimen in the Base Study were offered qHPV vaccine. Participants were followed in EXT1 for 7 months. In Extension 2 \\[LTFU (EXT2)\\], long-term effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of qHPV vaccine were followed up to 10 years following study enrollment. Participants who received ≥1 dose of qHPV vaccine in the Base Study or EXT1 were eligible to enroll in LTFU (EXT2).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Base Study: Incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6/11/16/18-related External Genital Warts, Penile/Perianal/Perineal Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN), Penile, Perianal or Perineal Cancer","timeFrame":"Base study: through Month 36","effectByArm":[{"arm":"qHPV Vaccine in Base Study","deltaMin":0.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo in Base Study","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["38012959","34780705","34265048","32184277","23831322","22029979","21288094"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":2020},"commonTop":["Injection Site Pain","Injection Site Erythema","Injection Site Swelling","Headache","Pyrexia"]}}
