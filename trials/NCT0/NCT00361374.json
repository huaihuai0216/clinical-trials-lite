Scores were obtained every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. The total sum score of the 17 items is used to assess depressive severity. Possible total scores range from 0-52, with a higher score indicating greater depressive severity. Scores of 7 or less are indicative of full remission (i.e. no depression). Scores of 8-15 indicate mild depression; scores of 16-25 indicate moderate depression; scores of 25 or greater indicate severe depression. Mixed model repeated measures analysis (MMRM) was used to examine treatment group effect on changes from baseline to week 8 in Hamilton D scores. Models included subjects as a random effect, and treatment group and study week as fixed effects. An auto-regressive covariance structure was used because it provided the best fit to the data. Site and baseline score were included as covariates in all models.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.34","spread":"0.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-9.26","spread":"0.62"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-9.49","spread":"0.61"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Difficulty sleeping","Decreased energy","Poor concentration","Anxiety","Fatigue"]}}}
