Individuals who express interest in participating will be invited for a screening visit. Individuals with a BMI \\< 19 or \\> 28 kg/m2 will be excluded from the study to avoid potential confounding effects that may result from extreme leanness or from obesity. Subjects will have no known systemic illness, taking any medication that could affect glucose metabolism and no history of upper gastrointestinal surgery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects \\< 18 years of age or \\> 40 years of age will not be studied to minimize the potential confounding effects of age on glucagon and insulin action. The subjects will not be taking medications that affect glucose metabolism (to be determined by PI) and have no history of chronic illness or upper gastrointestinal surgery. We are seeking to recruit subjects who do not have diabetes (fasting glucose \\<100mg/dL).","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Endogenous Glucose Production (EGP)","description":"is calculated by tracer-based measurement and expressed per kg lean body mass","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.99","spread":"0.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.02","spread":"0.74"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.82","spread":"0.82"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.52","spread":"0.96"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.48","spread":"1.07"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.38","spread":"1.13"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Phlebitis","Nausea"]}}}
