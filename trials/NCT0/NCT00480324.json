between, and including, 6 and 14 weeks (42-104 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination.\n* Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/guardians can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study\n* Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.\n* Born between a gestation period of 36 and 42 weeks inclusive.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the HRV vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of HRV vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* History of use of experimental rotavirus vaccine.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs since birth.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Uncorrected congenital malformation (such as Meckel's diverticulum) of the gastrointestinal tract that would predispose for intussusception.\n* Any clinically significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease including any uncorrected congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract or other serious medical condition determined by the investigator.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.\n* Previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing is required).\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Gastroenteritis within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned administration during the study period.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Weeks","maximumAge":"14
