Information on the onset of action, the overall safety, and how the drugs control asthma will also be assessed. The study is approximately 1 year in duration.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Area Under the Curve From 0 to 12 Hours [AUC](0-12 hr) of the Change From Baseline to the Week 12 Endpoint in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MF/F MDI 200/10 mcg BID","deltaMin":3.43,"sd":3.83},{"arm":"F/SC DPI 250/50 mcg BID","deltaMin":3.24,"sd":3.83}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["22152089","36472162"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":983},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
