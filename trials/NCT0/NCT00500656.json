The median time to onset of symptom relief for the icatibant group was compared to the the median time to onset of symptom relief for the tranexamic acid group. TOSR was defined as the time between time of injection to time of first documented onset of symptom relief for the three primary symptoms: cutaneous swelling, cutaneous skin, and abdominal pain. The primary symptom was based on the type of attack. For abdominal attacks, the single primary symptom was abdominal pain. For cutaneous attacks, the single primary symptom was either skin swelling or skin pain, whichever was most severe.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Almost Complete Symptom Relief","description":"Almost complete symptom relief was defined as a score between 0 and 10 mm on the VAS for at least three consecutive measurements for all symptoms.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"51.0","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":36},"commonTop":["Hereditary Angioedema","Nasopharyngitis","Injury, poisoning and procedual complications","Urinary Track Infection","Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders"]}}}
