Clomiphene citrate (CC) is the drug of first choice for this condition. Nevertheless, CC has a detrimental effect over uterine receptivity.\n\nRaloxifene is a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator, that does not have a detrimental effect over the endometrium, and also increase the serum levels of FSH, thus, inducting ovulation.\n\nThe objective of this study is to compare the ovulation rate in PCOS patients between clomiphene citrate and raloxifene in a double blind randomized trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Ovulation Detected by Ultrasound","timeFrame":"cycle day 14-20","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Clomiphene","deltaMin":52.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Raloxifene","deltaMin":40.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Brazil"]},"refs":{"pmids":["9385122","9435408","12383524","11308435","16418211","8962647","8062944","16530767","16580393","7851583","16412752","10480822","21782166"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["nausea","headache","abdominal bloating","pelvic pain"]}}
