Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if \"No,\" then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being \"A lot,\" \"A little,\" or \"Not at all\" (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively).
