No patient will be refused CP when compatible products are available and all efforts will be made to maximize CP availability during the study. EVD patients recruited during the period before CP becomes available or for whom no compatible CP is available will be given SC and will be followed for study outcomes. Data from these SC patients will be the used as comparator in the analysis of the study. The primary objective of the study is to assess if CP + SC improves the 14 day survival of patients, compared to SC alone.\n\nThe Investigators aim to enroll a total number of 130 - 200 patients who will be treated treated with CP assuming equal numbers of patients treated with SC alone. If there would be insufficient patients treated with SC, patients treated at the research site prior to study start may be included in the comparison group.\n\nPatients will be recruited in the Ebola Treatment centre managed by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Conakry, Guinea. All patients and/or relatives presenting at the centre will be informed about the study, and will be invited to provide consent at the time of admission inside the treatment centre. Only patients for whom ebola infection is confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be enrolled in the study. After inclusion, eligibility to the intervention will be reassessed on regular intervals. If the eligibility criteria are not met by 48 hours after inclusion, only SC will be continued.\n\nIn line with the guidance of the World Health Organization (WHO), two units of CP will be given. EVD patients will be transfused with ABO-compatible CP using standard procedures. Details on the modalities of transfusion can be found in the WHO guidance document and the MSF guidelines on blood transfusion. All patients will be under close observation for transfusion-related adverse reactions during and up to 4 hours after transfusion. 24 hours after the start of transfusion, a blood sample will be collected for viral load assessment. All other aspects of patient management will be according to MSF clinical guidelines. The decision to discharge a patient should be taken on clinical grounds, but can be supported by the laboratory results. After discharge, the patient will be followed up by the study team until day 30.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Survival at Day 14 After Start of Intervention","timeFrame":"14 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Convalescent Plasma","deltaMin":58,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Care","deltaMin":260,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Guinea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26735992","27959686","26768570"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":84},"commonTop":["Increase in temperature","Itching or skin rash","Nausea"]}}
