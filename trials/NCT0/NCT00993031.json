Assays include DNA PCR, HIV RNA, Western blot, or rapid HIV antibody test\n3. Confirmed pregnancy by positive serum or urine pregnancy test or ultrasound\n4. Estimated gestational age between 12 and 28 weeks (based on first day of last menstrual period with physical exam confirmation and ultrasound confirmation) at time of enrollment\n5. Residency within 30 km of the study site\n6. Willing to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Current or prior use of HAART\n2. Exposure to single-dose NVP (alone or with zidovudine or zidovudine/lamivudine or other abbreviated monotherapy or dual therapy for PMTCT) less than 24 months prior to enrollment\n3. Prior dose-limited toxicity to TS within 14 days of study enrollment\n4. Receipt of any contraindicated medications within 14 days of study enrollment (See Appendix III.)\n5. Active tuberculosis or other WHO Stage 4 diseases\n6. Screening laboratory values:\n\n   1. Hemoglobin: \\<7.5 g/dL (Note: Women found to have a hemoglobin \\<7.5 at screening may receive iron and folic acid and/or a blood transfusion at the physician's discretion. If a repeat hemoglobin is ≥7.5 g/dL, the woman may be considered for study inclusion.)\n   2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC): \\<750/mm3\n   3. Platelet count: \\<50,000/mm3\n   4.

Known cardiac conduction abnormalities or structural heart defect\n\nNOTE: A woman will be excluded from study participation during the current pregnancy if she goes into labor, experiences ruptured membranes or develops active tuberculosis or a WHO stage 4 condition following study enrollment but prior to study drug initiation.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"16 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Prevalence of Malaria Defined as Positive Placental Blood Smear","description":"Number of participants with positive placental blood smear for malaria","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Prevalence of Malaria Defined as Positive Placental Blood PCR","description":"Number of participants with positive placental blood PCR for malaria","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Placental Malaria Defined as Positive Placental RDT","description":"Number of participants with positive placental RDT for malaria.
