The purposes of this study were:\n\n1. To examine the long term safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab treatment in participants who received alemtuzumab as their study treatment in one of the prior studies.\n2. To examine the safety and efficacy of initial alemtuzumab treatment in this study for participants who received Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) as their study treatment in one of the prior studies.\n3. To determine the safety and efficacy of additional \"as needed\" alemtuzumab treatment courses. This applied both to participants who received alemtuzumab for the first time in one of the prior studies or for the first time in this extension study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)","timeFrame":"Year 3, 4, 5, 6 from the Baseline (Month 0 of CAMMS323 and Month 0 of CAMMS324 for \"Alemtuzumab Treatment CAMMS323 Extension\" group and \"Alemtuzumab Treatment CAMMS324 Extension\" group, respectively)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Alemtuzumab Treatment CAMMS323 Extension","deltaMin":0.19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Alemtuzumab Treatment CAMMS324 Extension","deltaMin":0.22,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":176,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18946064","23122652","23122650","39935588","37745914","36619856","34882037","34378446","34035833","33476880","33414927","32710396","32539719","31762387","31675266","31654272","31144568","28835401"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":376,"n":1314},"commonTop":["Multiple sclerosis relapse","Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Urinary tract infection","Fatigue"]}}
