Other aims are to learn if prophylactic treatment with lanadelumab reduces the number and severity of HAE attacks in children, how lanadelumab affects the child's body, and if the children develop antibodies to lanadelumab.\n\nThe study doctors will treat acute HAE attacks according to their standard practice.\n\nParticipants will receive lanadelumab for up to 52 weeks. When they start treatment, participants will visit their clinic every week for the first 4 weeks. Then, they will visit their clinic every 4 weeks during treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events Including Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 115 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lanadelumab 150 mg, q4wks","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lanadelumab 150 mg, q2wks","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Hungary","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37730089"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f6b5fdc4db2bf003ab472e6"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":11},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Skin abrasion","Abdominal pain","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
