The study drug was instilled approximately 15 minutes after the 8 am measurement. An additional dose was given at 3 pm. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry. One eye from each patient was chosen as the study eye and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.5","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.6","spread":"0.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"23.3","spread":"0.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.2","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.4","spread":"0.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"19.7","spread":"0.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.7","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.4","spread":"0.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"21.3","spread":"0.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.0","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.0","spread":"0.28"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"18.8","spread":"0.29"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":214},"commonTop":["Vision blurred","Dysgeusia"]}}}
