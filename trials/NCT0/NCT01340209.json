Tiotropium inhalation solution delivered by the Respimat inhaler will be examined on top of maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroid controller medication in patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma. Efficacy and safety will be assessed by measuring effects on lung function, effects on asthma exacerbations, effects on asthma control, and number of adverse events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Drug-related Adverse Events","timeFrame":"after the first dose of trial medication and within 30 days after the last dose of trial medication, up to 409","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo Respimat","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tiotropium Respimat (2.5 µg)","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tiotropium Respimat (5 μg)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":55,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36472162","31319851","25894430"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":57},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Asthma","Peak expiratory flow rate decreased","Bronchitis","Pharyngitis"]}}
