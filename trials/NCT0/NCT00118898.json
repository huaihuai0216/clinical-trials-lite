However, with new anti-HIV drugs being approved, alternative regimens need to be tested to determine if new drug combinations have increased effectiveness in treating HIV. The purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of four different regimens in HIV-infected adults who have never taken anti-HIV drugs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time From Randomization to Virologic Failure","timeFrame":"Follow-up time was variable,median follow-up was 138 weeks; see 'Amount of study follow-up' outcome for details","effectByArm":[{"arm":"EFV, FTC/TDF, and Placebo ABC/3TC","deltaMin":36,"sd":null},{"arm":"EFV, Placebo FTC/TDF, and ABC/3TC","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"RTV-boosted ATV, FTC/TDF, and Placebo ABC/3TC","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"RTV-boosted ATV, Placebo FTC/TDF, and ABC/3TC","deltaMin":24,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15479772","15503932","14668455","14668456","33901188","32829410","30642925","26009829","24979445","24872136","24637543","24384588","24253247","23204164","23148287","21690627","21606537","21320923","19952143"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":48,"n":461},"commonTop":["Blood cholesterol abnormal","Blood bilirubin increased","Low density lipoprotein abnormal","Blood glucose abnormal","Neutrophil count decreased"]}}
