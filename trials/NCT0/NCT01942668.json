Be a female between the ages of 40 and 65 years (at the time of randomization) who is willing to participate in the study, as documented by signing the informed consent form.\n2. Be a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus and a Screening serum estradiol level of ≤50 pg/mL. Postmenopausal is defined herein as:\n\n   1. ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea, or\n   2. at least 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with a Screening serum FSH level of \\>40 mIU/ml, or\n   3. ≥ 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy.\n3. Be seeking treatment or relief for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.\n4. To participate in the VMS Substudy, a subject must also report ≥7 moderate to severe hot flushes per day, or ≥50 per week, at the baseline assessment during Screening (subjects whose hot flushes are less frequent may still participate as non-Substudy subjects.\n\n   Note: A minimum of 14 consecutive days of complete hot flush diary data are required during the baseline assessment at Screening, and these consecutive days must occur within the last 14 days prior to the Randomization visit (not counting the Randomization visit day itself). The most recent 7 consecutive days of data prior to randomization (Day -7 to Day -1) will be used to determine the baseline number of mild, moderate and severe hot flushes for each subject.\n5. Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 34 kg/mP2P. (BMI values should be rounded to the nearest integer \\[e.g., 34.4 rounds down to 34, while 26.5 rounds up to 27\\]).\n6. Be willing to abstain from using products (other than study medication) that contain estrogen, progestin, or progesterone throughout study participation.\n7. Be judged by the principal or sub-investigator physician as being in otherwise generally good health based on a medical evaluation performed during the Screening period prior to the initial dose of study medication. The medical evaluation findings must include:\n\n   1. a normal or non-clinically significant physical examination, including vital signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature). Sitting systolic blood pressure is ≤140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg at Screening. A subject may be taking up to two antihypertensive medications.\n   2. a normal or non-clinically significant pelvic examination.\n   3. a mammogram that shows no sign of significant disease (can be performed within previous 6 months prior to initial dose of study medication). Subjects must have a BI-RADS 1 or 2 to enroll in the study. An incomplete mammogram result, i.e. BI-RADS 0, is not acceptable. The site must obtain a copy of the official report for the subject's study file, and it must be verified that the mammogram itself is available if needed for additional assessment.\n   4. a normal or non-clinically significant clinical breast examination. An acceptable breast examination is defined as no masses or other findings identified that are suspicious of malignancy.\n   5. a normal Screening Papanicolaou (\"Pap\") smear. (Subjects with findings of atypical glandular cells \\[AGC\\], AGUS, ASCUS with high risk HPV type upon reflex testing, LSIL, ASC-H, HSIL, dysplastic cells, or malignant cells must be excluded from randomization.)\n   6. an acceptable result from an evaluable Screening endometrial biopsy. The endometrial biopsy reports by the two central pathologists at Screening must each specify one of the following: proliferative endometrium; weakly proliferative endometrium; disordered proliferative pattern; secretory endometrium; endometrial tissue other (including benign, inactive or atrophic fragments of endometrial epithelium, glands, stroma, etc); endometrial tissue insufficient for diagnosis; no endometrium identified; or no tissue identified. However, at least one pathologist must identify sufficient tissue to evaluate the biopsy.
