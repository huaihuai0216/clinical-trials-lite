The questions are based on a 7-point scale where a '0' means having no limitations and a '6' means extreme or complete limitations. The final score is the mean of all ten questions. The CCQ score was recalculated according to the paper by Van der Molen et al., 2003. The statistical significance remained the same.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":"1.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.7","spread":"0.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.7","spread":"1.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.9","spread":"1.0"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":59},"commonTop":["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Cough","Dizziness"]}}}
