In adults, DHA has been shown to lower triglycerides and is important to cardiovascular health and autonomic control, lowering heart rate and blood pressure and increasing heart variability. Little is known about how fatty acids impact cardiac control in infants, children or the fetus. Our hypothesis is that maternal DHA supplementation (600 mg/day) will lower fetal HR and increase fetal HRV.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Heart Rate","timeFrame":"24, 32 and 36 weeks gestational age","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":146,"sd":6.5},{"arm":"Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)","deltaMin":145.2,"sd":6.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23433688","32662379","31071684"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
