Physical activity was assessed by the 6 minute walk test, and daily physical activity was continuously measured by means of a wrist-worn accelerometry device from 2 weeks before until 12 weeks after start of study therapy (sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (Week 0) in the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) at End of Study (Week 12)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LCZ696 (Sacubitril/Valsartan)","deltaMin":365.37,"sd":108.18},{"arm":"Enalapril","deltaMin":371.08,"sd":104.41}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2464"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0503"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":119,"countries":["Belgium","Bulgaria","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Iceland","Ireland","Latvia","Lithuania","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":309},"commonTop":["Hypotension","Hyperkalaemia","Dizziness","Cough","Dyspnoea"]}}
