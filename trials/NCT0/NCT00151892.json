Over time, patients with this disease may experience acute episodes of diarrhea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain followed by periods of time without disease symptoms. 5-ASA drugs are a standard treatment for ulcerative colitis. Mesalazine is an experimental drug designed to gradually release 5-ASA into the areas of large bowel associated with ulcerative colitis. This study will test the safety and efficacy of mesalazine in keeping ulcerative colitis in remission.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Endoscopic Remission of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) at 6 Months","timeFrame":"6 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SPD476","deltaMin":83.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Asacol","deltaMin":81.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":142,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Peru","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.lialda.com/Professional/pdf/pi.pdf","http://www.fda.gov/opacom/7alerts.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":415},"commonTop":[]}}
