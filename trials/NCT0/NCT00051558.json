Glucocorticoids (such as prednisone) are prescribed to treat a large number of conditions such as arthritis and asthma. When taken for several months or longer, glucocorticoids can cause bone loss and lead to a form of osteoporosis called \"glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.\" This study compared the effects of teriparatide, the study drug, with alendronate, an approved drug for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline at 18 Month Endpoint in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD)","timeFrame":"18 month endpoint","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Teriparatide","deltaMin":0.059,"sd":0.006},{"arm":"Alendronate","deltaMin":0.028,"sd":0.006}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Denmark","Norway","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27111239","19918047","18003959"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":70},"commonTop":["Nausea","Back pain","Urinary tract infection","Influenza","Arthralgia"]}}
