Failure to object is not to be considered assent.\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\nSubjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following criteria are met at Entry:\n\n* Subject was discontinued from SPD485-409 due to a protocol violation, non-compliance, AE, or a serious adverse event (SAE).\n* Subject has a concurrent chronic or acute illness (such as severe allergic rhinitis or an infectious process requiring antibiotics), disability, or other condition that might confound the results of safety assessments administered in the study or that might increase risk to the subject. Similarly, the subject will be excluded if he or she has any additional condition(s) that in the Investigator's opinion would prohibit the subject from completing the study or would not be in the best interest of the subject. This would include any significant illness or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol. Mild, stable asthma is not exclusionary.\n* Subject is taking any medication that is excluded.\n* Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"13 Years","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-fourth Edition (ADHD-RS-IV) Scores at 6 Months","description":"The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) with total score ranging from 0 to 54.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.0","spread":"12.00"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.4","spread":"12.91"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.5","spread":"10.55"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.5","spread":"9.53"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.6","spread":"11.80"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-12.9","spread":"15.20"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Conner's Parent Rating Scale-revised Short Version (CPRS-R) at 6 Months","description":"The Conner's Parent rating Scale-revised short version (CPRS-R) consists of 27 questions graded on a scale from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true) with a total score ranging from 0 to 81.
