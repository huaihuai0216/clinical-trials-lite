History of allergic, dermatological, or adverse event to mifepristone\n4. Chronic organic mental disorder, insufficient proficiency in English that would render an individual incapable of giving informed consent.\n5. Significant current suicidal risks, history of significant suicidal behavior or any suicide attempt within the past year.\n6. Unstable physical disorders, which might make participation hazardous such as hypertension (\\>140/90), WBC \\< 3.5, new diagnosis of hepatitis (patients with chronic mildly elevated transaminase levels (£2-3 X upper limit of normal will be considered acceptable if PT/PTT is normal), renal failure (creat \\> 2; BUN \\> 40), or diabetes (HbA1c \\> 7%), and low Hb (\\< 12g/dL) or low Hct (\\<36%).\n7. Coronary vascular disease as indicated by history, or suspected by abnormal ECG or history of cardiac symptoms. Hx of cardiac symptoms (chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope) during cocaine use.\n8. Cardiac conduction system disease as indicated by QRS duration of ³ 0.11 msec.\n9. Currently meets DSM-IV criteria for another substance dependence or abuse disorder other than nicotine, alcohol, or cannabis. If alcohol dependent, must not be in need of detoxification. Heavy male drinkers (who consume greater than 5 standard alcoholic drink per day per NIAAA definition) will be excluded.\n10. Presents with metabolic indicators of hypoadrenalism such as low serum sodium (\\<130 mEq/L), high serum potassium (\\>5.5 mEq/L), Na/K ratio \\< 30:1, low fasting blood sugar (\\<50 mg/dL), or high BUN (\\>20 mg/dL), or a previous history of Addison's disease or adrenal insufficiency, or the presence of low K (\\< 3.5 mEq/L). spot AM cortisol \\<5ug/dL, PM cortisol \\< 3 ug/dL\n11.
