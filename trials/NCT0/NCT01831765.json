The aim of the trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) compared to insulin aspart, both in combination with insulin detemir in adults with type 1 diabetes. This trial consists of two periods: a 26 week treatment period followed by a 26 week additional treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in HbA1c (Glycosylated Haemoglobin)","timeFrame":"Week 0, week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Faster Aspart (Meal)","deltaMin":7.62,"sd":0.71},{"arm":"Faster Aspart (Post)","deltaMin":7.63,"sd":0.72},{"arm":"NovoRapid (Meal)","deltaMin":7.58,"sd":0.68}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":191,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Finland","Germany","Hungary","Poland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30949906","28356319","29316130","29463670","30402720","30547388"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":35,"n":386},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Influenza","Nausea"]}}
