The minimum angle of resolution (MAR) is the angle a viewed object subtends at the eye, usually stated in degrees/minutes of arc. Visual acuity was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts in decimal numbers. The LogMAR scale is used to express the visual acuity in a linear scale as the logarithm to base 10 of the MAR. A lower score indicates better visual acuity; visual acuity decreases with an increasing score.
