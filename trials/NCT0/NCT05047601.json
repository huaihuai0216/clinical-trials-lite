Two-thirds of participants will also receive two study medicines (PF-07321332 and ritonavir) by mouth twice a day for either five or ten days. We will compare the experiences of people receiving the study medicines to those of the people who do not. This will help us determine if the study medicines are safe and effective","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Developed Symptomatic RT-PCR or RAT Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection Through Day 14: Among Participants With Negative RT-PCR at Baseline","timeFrame":"From Day 1 to Day 14","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) 300 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg 5 Days","deltaMin":2.607,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) 300 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg 10 Days","deltaMin":2.41,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3.929,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.1722"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.1163"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":170,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Bulgaria","Colombia","Czechia","Hungary","Japan","Malaysia","Mexico","Poland","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39018532"],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=C4671006"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":912},"commonTop":["Dysgeusia","COVID-19","Headache","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
