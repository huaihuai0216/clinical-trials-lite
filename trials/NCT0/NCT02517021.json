Patients are randomized according to a 1:1 ratio (IV NEPA FDC : oral NEPA FDC). No formal comparison is planned, the presence of a control in the same patient population helps interpret any unexpected safety finding in the experimental arm. It is expected that the number of patients randomized to the test group, i.e., 200, will allow approximately 100 patients to be treated with the test drug for 4 cycles. Based on 100 patients treated at Cycle 4 with the IV NEPA FDC , if a given Adverse Event (AE) is not observed, an AE incidence of 3% or greater can be excluded with 95% confidence.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"169","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"174","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"90","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"43","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With Complete Response (CR) Defined as no Emesis, no Rescue Medication, in the Acute Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"188","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"182","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With Complete Response (CR) Defined as no Emesis, no Rescue Medication, in the Delayed Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"159","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"176","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With Complete Response (CR) Defined as no Emesis, no Rescue Medication, in the Overall Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"156","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"169","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With no Emetic Episodes in the Acute Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"164","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"165","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With no Emetic Episodes in the Delayed Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"173","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"184","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With no Emetic Episodes in the Overall Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"171","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"178","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With no Significant Nausea (VAS <25 mm) During the Acute Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"183","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"187","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With no Significant Nausea (VAS <25 mm) During the Delayed Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"165","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"179","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With no Significant Nausea (VAS <25 mm) During the Overall Phase","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"161","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"174","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":41,"n":203},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Anaemia","Alopecia","Constipation","Leukopenia"]}}}
