BCVA was measured using an eye chart and reported as the number of letters read correctly using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved. The percentage of participants with a BCVA loss of fewer than 15 letters are reported. The study eye is defined as the eye that meets the entry criteria. If both eyes met the entry criteria, the eye with the worse BCVA at baseline (Day 1) was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had same BCVA values at baseline (Day 1), then the participant had to select their non-dominant eye for treatment, or else the right eye was selected as the study eye.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"95.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye at Week 52","description":"BCVA was measured using an eye chart and was reported as the number of letters read correctly using the ETDRS Scale (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye.

The overall composite score is then calculated by averaging over all 11 vision-targeted subscale scores, excluding the general health score. Overall composite score was calculated based on mean of non-missing subscales. Study eye was defined as eye that meets entry criteria. If both eyes met all of entry criteria, eye with worse BCVA at baseline (day 1) was selected.
