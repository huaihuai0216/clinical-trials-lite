Both raters were independent trained clinicians, experienced in the assessment of patients with dementia. Neither rater was involved in any other way with the patients' treatment or evaluation throughout the study. At baseline, both raters had access to all of the patient's available records and evaluations. Subsequently, for all ratings of change from baseline, the rater relied solely on information obtained during the baseline interview of the patient and caregiver, including written notes and, if available, the baseline interview audio- or videotape.

It was designed to assess the patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item were obtained from the caregiver through an interview. For each basic ADL, there was a forced choice of best response or a \"yes\" or \"no\" question with additional sub questions. Higher numbered scores and answers of \"yes\" reflected a more self-sufficient individual. Therefore, the higher total score, the higher functioning the patient was. The total score was the sum of all items and sub questions.
