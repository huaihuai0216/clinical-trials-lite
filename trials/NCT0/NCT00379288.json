Historical reversibility defined as an increase in absolute forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of \\>= 12% and \\>= 200 mL will qualify if performed within 12 months of Screening. If no historical reversibility, subject must demonstrate an absolute FEV1 of \\>= 12% and \\>= 200 mL within 10 to 15 minutes after four puffs of salbutamol at Visit 1 or anytime prior to Baseline.\n* At Screening and Baseline, FEV1 must be \\>= 50% predicted, when restricted medications are withheld for the appropriate intervals.\n* Complete blood count, blood chemistries, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram (ECG) conducted at Screening must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator/sponsor. A chest x-ray performed at Screening or within 12 months prior must be clinically acceptable.\n* A female of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable, adequate form of birth control:\n\n  * prescribed hormonal contraceptives;\n  * medically prescribed intrauterine device (IUD);\n  * medically prescribed transdermal contraceptive;\n  * condom in combination with spermicide;\n  * monogamous relationship with a male partner who has had a vasectomy.\n\nBirth control must have started at least 3 months prior to Screening. Subject must agree to continue its use for the duration of the study. A subject of childbearing potential who is not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically acceptable method should she become sexually active during the study. Women who have been surgically sterilized or are at least 1 year postmenopausal are not considered to be of childbearing potential. A subject of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* A change (increase or decrease) in absolute FEV1 of \\> 20% at any time from the Screening Visit up to, and including, the Baseline Visit.\n* A subject who requires the use of \\> 12 inhalations per day of short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) MDI or \\> 2 nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg salbutamol, on any 2 consecutive days from the Screening Visit up to, and including, the Baseline Visit.\n* A subject who experiences a clinical asthma exacerbation (defined as a deterioration of asthma that results in emergency treatment, hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded asthma medication \\[other than SABA\\]) at any time from the Screening Visit up to, and including, the Baseline Visit.\n* A subject who has ever required ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to asthma.\n* A subject who is a smoker or ex-smoker and has smoked within the previous year or has had a cumulative smoking history \\> 10 pack-years.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Number of All Randomized Subjects Reporting Adverse Events (AEs).","description":"AEs that are considered Related, Severe, and Serious, as determined by the investigator and using specific criteria defined in the protocol, are included in the primary results.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"109","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"103","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"56","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"50","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"13","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":141},"commonTop":["HEADACHE","NASOPHARYNGITIS","BRONCHITIS","INFLUENZA","PHARYNGITIS"]}}}
