The patients were given a paper with a 10cm horizontal line on it. On the left was marked \"No pain\" and on the right \"Worst pain imaginable\". The patients were then asked to mark a vertical line along the 10cm line that indicated where their pain was. The score is the number of centimeters from the left. 0 is minimum (best). 10 maximum (worst).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Oral Morphine Equivalents of Opioids Prescribed","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"60","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"50","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Patients With Narcotic Prescription","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"44","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"35","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Unplanned Healthcare Interactions","description":"Unplanned healthcare interactions include unplanned visits, emergency room visits, admissions to the hospital, and phone calls","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Serious Adverse Events","description":"Composite of unplanned serious adverse events including intensive care unit stay and death","classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Patients Reporting Nausea or Vomiting","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Watson Clock Drawing Test Score","description":"This score is based on the scoring method described in Watson et al 1993.

For errors in quadrant 4, a score of 4 is assigned. The scores are summed.
