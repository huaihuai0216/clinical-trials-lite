with high-risk neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps kill any tumor cells that are in the body and helps make room in the patient?s bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. After treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the high- chemotherapy. It is not yet known which regimen of high-dose chemotherapy is more effective for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma undergoing a peripheral blood stem cell transplant.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival Rate","timeFrame":"Three years, from time of randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Single HST (CEM)","deltaMin":48.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tandem HST (CEM), Randomly Assigned","deltaMin":61.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0082"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":190,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40036726","32530765","31454045"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":206},"commonTop":["58300-Neutrophil count decreased","65800-Platelet count decreased","33300-Febrile neutropenia","44800-Infections and infestations - Other specify","88500-White blood cell decreased"]}}
