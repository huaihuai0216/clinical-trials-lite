On this study, you will have one of 2 types of commonly-used breathing tubes used, either a VDLT or a non-video double lumen tube (called a non-video DLT). An FOB may or may not be performed, as described below.\n\nThe level of effectiveness of the VDLT and non-video DLT will be compared.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Fiberoptic Use During Surgeries Requiring Lung Isolation","timeFrame":"During surgery (from induction to extubation), an average of 1 hour","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mallinckrodt Double Lumen Tube (DLT)","deltaMin":42,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vivasight Video Double Lumen Tube (VDLT)","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":42},"commonTop":[]}}
