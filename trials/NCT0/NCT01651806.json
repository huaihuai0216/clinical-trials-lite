This includes having a greater impact on decreasing blood loss without increasing the occurrence of adverse thromboembolic events in patients undergoing primary, elective total knee arthroplasty.\n\nSecondary - TA will decrease blood loss more effectively in women than in men undergoing this procedure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary Intra-operative Blood Loss","timeFrame":"Intra-operative, an average of 3 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Female Uniform Single Dose TA Patient","deltaMin":100,"sd":31.69},{"arm":"Female Weighted Dose TA Patient","deltaMin":65,"sd":8.5},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":142.8,"sd":197},{"arm":"Male Uniform Single Dose TA","deltaMin":100,"sd":31.69},{"arm":"Male Weighted Dose TA Patient","deltaMin":65,"sd":8.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19007970","14763696","20063079"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":13},"commonTop":["Blood Transfusion"]}}
