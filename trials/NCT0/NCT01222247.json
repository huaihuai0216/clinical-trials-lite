A twin pregnancy reduced to singleton (either spontaneously or therapeutically) before 14,0 weeks by project gestational age is acceptable\n\nGestational age at randomization between 34,0 weeks and 36,5 weeks confirmed by study criteria\n\nHigh probability of delivery in the late preterm period (any one of the following):\n\n* Membrane rupture as defined by the occurrence of any two of the following: pooling of fluid in the vaginal vault, positive Nitrazine test, ferning of vaginal fluid, positive AmniSure test; or any one of the following: indigo carmine pooling in the vagina after amnioinfustion, visible leakage of amniotic fluid from the cervix\n\nor\n\n* Preterm labor with intact membranes. Preterm labor is defined as at least 6 regular uterine contractions in an observation period of no more than 60 minutes and at least one of the following: cervix greater than or equal to 3cm dilated or at least 75% effaced\n\nor\n\n* Planned delivery by induction of labor or cesarean section in no less than 24 hours and no more than 7 days, as deemed necessary by the provider. An induction must be scheduled to start by 36,5 weeks at the latest, whereas a cesarean delivery must be scheduled by 36,6 weeks at the latest. Therefore the latest gestational age for randomization is 36,4 weeks for a planned induction. The planned delivery may be for any indication, such as the following: prior myomectomy, prior classical cesarean, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing warranting delivery, abruption, placenta previa\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Any prior antenatal corticosteroid course during the pregnancy because of potential contamination of the placebo group\n2. Candidate for stress dose corticosteroids because of chronic steroid therapy to prevent suppression of adrenal gland, because of potential contamination of the placebo group\n3. Twin gestation reduced to a singleton gestation at or after 14 weeks 0 days by project gestational age either spontaneously or therapeutically\n4. Fetal demise, or known major fetal anomaly, including cardiac anomaly and hydrops\n5. Maternal contraindication to betamethasone: hypersensitivity reaction to any components of the medication, idiopathic thromboycytopenic purpura, systemal fungal infection in case of exacerbation by betamethasone, use of amphotericin B due to the possibility of heart failure with concomitant betamethasone\n6. Pre-gestational diabetes - exclude if the patient was on medication (insulin, glyburide) prior to pregnancy\n7. Delivery expected within 12 hours of randomization, because of insufficient time of corticosteroids to confer benefit, including any of the following:\n\n   A. Rupture of Membranes (ROM) does not satisfy protocol criteria - exclude if the patient being evaluated for Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (pPROM), does not have preterm labor or planned delivery and does not satisfy the spontaneous membrane rupture criteria (any 2 of: positive Nitrazine test, pooling of fluid in the vaginal vault test or ferning of vaginal fluid; or indigo carmine pooling in the vagina after amnioinfusion; or visible leakage of amniotic fluid from the cervix) B. Rupture of the membranes in the presence of more than 6 contractions per hour or cervical dilation of 3 cm or more, unless oxytocin was withheld for at least 12 hours (other induction agents allowed) C. Chorioamnionitis - exclude if patient is diagnosed with chorioamnionitis D. Cervical dilation ≥ 8 cm E. Evidence of non-reassuring fetal status requiring immediate delivery\n8. Participation in another interventional study that influences neonatal morbidity and mortality\n9. Participation in this trial in a previous pregnancy\n10. Delivery at a non-network hospital\n11. At 36, 0 weeks to 36, 5 weeks and quota for 36 weeks already met. To ensure there is an adequate proportion of women presenting at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation, enrollment will be restricted so that no more than 50% of the women in the trial present at 36 weeks.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Neonatal Composite Outcome","description":"Need for respiratory support: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) for greater than or equal to 2 hours or more in the first 72 hours, or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) greater than or equal to 0.30 for 4 hours or more in the first 72 hours, or mechanical ventilation in the first 72 hours, or Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) Stillbirth, or neonatal death less than 72 hours of age","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"165","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"202","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"145","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"184","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"61","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"43","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Neonates With Severe Respiratory Complication,","description":"A severe respiratory complication was defined as any of the following occurrences within 72 hours after birth: CPAP or high-flow nasal cannula for at least 12 hours, supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.30 or more for at least 24 hours, mechanical ventilation, stillbirth or neonatal death, or the need for ECMO.
