The stoma will be set to 7mm using the EndoFLIP system to measure stoma size. Thereafter, band adjustments will be made using an adjustment chart, created at surgery, which shows stoma size versus band fill, to make adjustments in the normal follow-up visits. It is hypothesized that an early adjustment at surgery will promote earlier weight loss, and result in fewer band adjustments being required in the first year after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"%Excess Weight Loss 4-6 Weeks After Surgery (Large and Small Bands)","timeFrame":"4-6 weeks post surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Historic","deltaMin":15.63,"sd":8.9},{"arm":"Stoma Adjustment at Surgery","deltaMin":20.8,"sd":10.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":49},"commonTop":[]}}
