A 4-week run-in period will be followed by a median of 6 years of treatment with study medication in addition to continuation of background glucose lowering therapy. Patients inadequately controlled on background metformin will be randomised to receive, in addition to metformin, either rosiglitazone or a sulfonylurea(glibenclamide, gliclazide or glimepiride) in a ratio of 1:1. Patients inadequately controlled on background SU will be randomised to receive, in addition to SU, either rosiglitazone or metformin in a ratio of 1:1. Equal numbers of patients receiving background metformin and SU at entry will be entered into the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Cardiovascular Death/Cardiovascular Hospitalisation Events","timeFrame":"Baseline through End of Study (up to 7.5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Combined RSG","deltaMin":321,"sd":null},{"arm":"Combined MET/SU","deltaMin":323,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":446,"countries":["Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Netherlands","New Zealand","Poland","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17517066","16025252","17551159","19501900","18435852","25524432","21562320"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":424,"n":1117},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Hyperlipidaemia","Nasopharyngitis","Hypoglycaemia","Bronchitis"]}}
