Complete loss of erections after radiation treatment can happen in 40-50% of treated patients. There are medications, like sildenafil (also known as Viagra), that can help the ability to get back erections in almost 70% of such patients.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if taking Viagra every day starting right before, during and for about 6 months after treatment, could reduce the risk of long-term erectile dysfunction.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Assessment of Erectile Dysfunction","timeFrame":"Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Prophylactic Sildenafil Citrate With Radiotherapy","deltaMin":64,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo With Radiotherapy","deltaMin":64,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mskcc.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":184},"commonTop":["Glucose, high (hyperglycemia)"]}}
