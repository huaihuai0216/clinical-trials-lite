The purpose of each item is to rate the severity of that abnormality in the patient. A severity rating is assigned to each of the eleven items, based on the patient's subjective report of his or her condition over the previous forty-eight hours and the clinician's behavioral observations during the interview, with the emphasis on the latter. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. Total score of zero to 60 is possible, zero being normal and 60 being severe, 12 serving as a cut off point for illness if equal or above. There are several ways to show change in outcome. We show the mean and standard deviation at week 0 and 6.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.09","spread":"7.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.59","spread":"7.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.24","spread":"12.49"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.22","spread":"10.50"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Child Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS-R)","description":"Response for depressive symptoms was defined as a score less than 40 on the CDRS-R. Range is 18 to 120. Score 18 is normal and higher score signifies depression. The Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) is a 16-item measure used to determine the severity of depression in children 6-18 years of age. Items are measured on 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-point scales.

In addition to rating the overall illness with the CGI-BP, severity and improvement are considered on various other dimensions such as mania, depression, attention deficit/hyperactivity, psychosis, aggression and sleep difficulties. Score of 1, 2 and 3 would mean there is clinically observed symptom improvement where 1 is the best outcome than 2 or 3. The point 4 is the point where the subject presents at baseline of that specific individual.
