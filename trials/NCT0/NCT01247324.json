Participants will be randomized to receive either ocrelizumab 600 mg or matching placebo intravenous (IV) as 300 mg infusions on Days 1 and 15 for the first dose and as a single infusion of 600 mg for all subsequent infusions every 24 weeks, with placebo injections matching interferon beta-1a SC three times per week; or interferon beta-1a 44 mcg SC injections three times per week (with placebo infusions matching ocrelizumab infusions every 24 weeks). Planned duration of double-blind treatment is 96 weeks. Participants who complete the 96-week double-blind treatment will have an option to enter a single-group, active-treatment, open-label extension period, providing they fulfill the eligibility criteria.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) in Participants With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (MS) at 96 Weeks","timeFrame":"Week 96","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Interferon Beta-1a 44 mcg SC","deltaMin":0.292,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ocrelizumab","deltaMin":0.156,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":142,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Chile","Czechia","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Mexico","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland","Tunisia","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40629721","40554392","40258203","39965438","39290861","37652990","37148240","37094998","36792367","36163349","35672926","34904871","33724637","32690791","32511687","28002679"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":32,"n":409},"commonTop":["INFUSION RELATED REACTION","URINARY TRACT INFECTION","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","NASOPHARYNGITIS","COVID-19"]}}
