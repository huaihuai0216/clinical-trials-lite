For each item, severity was rated on an anchored 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. If one or more items are missing at a given assessment, the total score is set to missing. Total score ranges from 30 to 210. Score indicates severity of the disease, i.e. low score = low severity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-22.1","spread":"1.158"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-20.4","spread":"1.162"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-15.5","spread":"1.166"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Asenapine Maleate Patches Compared With Placebo Patches in Subjects Diagnosed With Schizophrenia as Measured Using the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness Scale: Change From Baseline to Week 6.","description":"To evaluate efficacy and safety of HP-3070 compared with placebo for the treatment of schizophrenia as evaluated by the Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness Scale.\n\nThe severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S.
