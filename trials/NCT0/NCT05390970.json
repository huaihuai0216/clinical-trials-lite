Subjects will undergo an injection of PRP (or injectable saline placebo) into the anterior vaginal wall in the office. Primary outcomes will include a negative urinary stress test plus improvement with the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at 6-months. Secondary outcomes will include the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Incontinence Quality of life (I-QOL), Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis (QUID), and the visual analog scale for pain.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Negative Urinary Stress Test (no Leakage Noted on Examination During Cough or Valsalva Maneuvers at a Standardized Bladder Volume of 300 mL)","timeFrame":"6-months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Platelet-rich Plasma","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (Saline)","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":["Vaginal discomfort","Vaginal spotting","vaginal pain","Urinary Tract Infection","Blood in urine"]}}
