In addition, the site of the infection will be photographed. The patients will be randomly assigned one of the treatments: intravenous (IV)/per oral (PO) moxifloxacin (drug under evaluation) or IV piperacillin/tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (i.e., one of the reference treatments for this kind of infection). The maximum treatment duration will be 21 days, and the minimum will be 7 days. During the hospitalization, the patients will have a physical examination every day. On Day 3-5 during therapy as well as at the end of treatment, the patients will have repeated examinations. These tests and evaluations will be repeated 14 to 28 days after the end of treatment. During this visit, blood and urine samples will be taken only if judged necessary by the physicians.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Cured Participants as Determined by the Data Review Committee (DRC) at Test of Cure Visit in the Per Protocol (PP) Population","timeFrame":"14 - 28 days after last dose of study medication","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Moxifloxacin","deltaMin":88.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"PIP/TAZ-AMC","deltaMin":89.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":123,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Bulgaria","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21896561","23180507","31786695"],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":426},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Hypertension","Pyrexia","Nausea","Headache"]}}
