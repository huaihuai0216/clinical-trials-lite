Study BMN 165-301 is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized study designed to further characterize the safety of BMN 165 during two induction, titration, and maintenance dose regimens in adults with PKU who have not had previous exposure to BMN 165 (naive). Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to titrate up to one of two dose regimens. Other key features of this study are the dose regimens chosen for induction and titration; the study duration; self administration of study drug; and the chosen tertiary objectives.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Hypersensitivity Adverse Reaction","timeFrame":"baseline and 36 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BMN 165, 20mg/Day","deltaMin":111,"sd":null},{"arm":"BMN 165, 40mg/Day","deltaMin":119,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":31,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34826353"],"seeAlso":["http://www.bmrn.com","http://www.pku.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":131},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Injection site reaction","Injection site erythema","Headache","Rash"]}}
