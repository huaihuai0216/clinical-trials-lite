Multi-organ dysfunction will be measured as the incidence of the following composite endpoint (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, mechanical support, need for inotropes or vasopressors, liver dysfunction (increased bilirubin), and all-cause mortality). We will also assess multiple pre-specified secondary (exploratory) endpoints and safety endpoints.\n\nWe hypothesize that, as compared to placebo, tocilizumab will reduce transfer to the ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, increase rates of hospital discharge in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 infection and evidence of exaggerated inflammatory response.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mechanical Ventilation or Death","timeFrame":"28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab","deltaMin":9.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.64"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33085857"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":161},"commonTop":["Hypotension","decreased white blood cell count","Hypertension","Anemia","Diarrhea"]}}
