The volume of the edema is defined as biometric data measured by the use of MRT before and six weeks after treatment. The hypothesis has to be checked whether Zoledronic Acid is efficient in the treatment of painful bone marrow edema. A statistically significant reduction of the edema in the MRT is considered as evidence for efficacy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Reduction of the Edema Area","timeFrame":"Week 6 after administration of a single intravenous dose of zoledronic acid (5 mg)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zoledronic Acid","deltaMin":64.53,"sd":41.92},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":23.97,"sd":46.52}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.006"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.015"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":34},"commonTop":["Headache","Pain in extremity","Fatigue","Chills","Pyrexia"]}}
