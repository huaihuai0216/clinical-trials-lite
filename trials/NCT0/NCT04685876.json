The primary aim is to assess the duration of the local analgesia (determined by pinprick and cold) in all four quadrants. Comparing opioid consumption and pain scores is a secondary aim. All aims will be assessed over 72 hours or the duration of hospitalization if shorter.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Opioids During Postoperative 24 Hours","timeFrame":"Postoperative 24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liposomal Bupivacaine","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Plain Bupivacaine","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Normal Saline","deltaMin":31,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.355"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.578"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":96},"commonTop":["Opioid related side effects"]}}
