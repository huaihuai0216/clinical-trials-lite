At low frequencies, the current cannot bridge the cellular membrane and will pass predominantly through the extra-cellular space. At higher frequencies penetration of the cell membrane occurs and the current is conducted by both the extra-cellular water (ECW) and intra-cellular water (ICW).FFM can be estimated because FFM is primarily composed of water.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.7","spread":"2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.4","spread":"2"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Glucose Concentrations","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.28","spread":"0.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.65","spread":".4"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Post Load Glucose Concentrations","description":"It was performed 2 hours after 75g oral glucose tolerance test (75-OGTT).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.29","spread":"0.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.3","spread":"1.1"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Insulin Concentrations","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-24.8","spread":"20.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-19","spread":"23.3"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":[]}}}
