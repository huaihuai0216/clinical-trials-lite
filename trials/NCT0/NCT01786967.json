Although anticholinergic medications are the most common therapy, the investigators are unable to predict an individual's response to a particular drug in terms of both effectiveness and side effects. Through genetic evaluation, the investigators have the potential to personalize and optimize drug therapy for millions of elderly women suffering from urge incontinence.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage With Treatment Success","timeFrame":"4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Extensive Metabolizers","deltaMin":74.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Poor Metabolizers","deltaMin":75,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"1.0"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":54},"commonTop":["Anticholinergic adverse events"]}}
