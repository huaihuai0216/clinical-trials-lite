HCV mainly affects liver cells and causes the liver to become inflamed and damaged. This study will evaluate how safe and effective glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) is in adult and adolescent participants with acute HCV infection.\n\nGLE/PIB is an approved drug for the treatment of chronic HCV. Around 283 participants at least 12 years of age with acute HCV Infection will be enrolled in approximately 70 sites worldwide.\n\nParticipants will receive oral tablets of GLE/PIB once daily (QD) for 8 weeks and will be followed for 12 weeks after the end of treatment.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, monitoring for side effects and completing questionnaires.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks Post-treatment (SVR12) in the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population","timeFrame":"12 weeks after last dose of study treatment (Week 20)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir","deltaMin":96.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.rxabbvie.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":286},"commonTop":["FATIGUE","DIARRHOEA","NASOPHARYNGITIS"]}}
