In addition, assent must be obtained from paediatric subjects who possess the intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the trial. If the paediatric subject is not able to provide assent (due to age, maturity and/or inability to intellectually and/or emotionally comprehend the trial), the parent/legal guardian's written Informed Consent for the subject will be acceptable for the subject to be included in the study.\n* Presence of an appropriate mild or moderate bleeding soft tissue or hepatic parenchyma Target Bleeding Site (TBS) identified intra-operatively by the surgeon;\n* Ability to firmly press trial treatment at TBS until 4 minutes after randomisation\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the study product or is unwilling to receive blood products;\n* Female subjects, who are of childbearing age (i.e. adolescent), who are pregnant or nursing;\n* Subject is currently participating or plans to participate in any other investigational device or drug without prior approval from the Sponsor;\n* Subjects who are known, current alcohol and/or drug abusers\n* Subjects admitted for trauma surgery\n* Subjects with any pre or intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude conduct of the study procedure.\n* Subject with TBS in an actively infected field (Class III Contaminated or Class IV Dirty or Infected)\n* TBS is from large defects in arteries or veins where the injured vascular wall requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and which would result in persistent exposure of the EVARREST™ or SURGICEL® to blood flow and pressure during healing and absorption of the product;\n* TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;\n* Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony confine.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"28 Days","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Time to Haemostasis (TTH)","description":"Absolute TTH, defined as the absolute time elapsed from randomization to the last moment in time at which detectable bleeding at the target bleeding site (TBS) was observed.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Haemostatic Success at 4 Minutes Following Randomization With No Bleeding Requiring Treatment at the Target Bleeding Site Occurring Any Time Prior to Final Fascial Closure","description":"Percentage of participants achieving haemostatic success at 4 minutes following randomization with no bleeding requiring treatment at the TBS occurring any time prior to final fascial closure were reported.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"80.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"60.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Haemostatic Success at 10 Minutes Following Randomization With No Bleeding Requiring Treatment at the Target Bleeding Site Occurring Any Time Prior to Final Fascial Closure","description":"Percentage of participants achieving haemostatic success at 10 minutes following randomization with no bleeding requiring treatment at the TBS occurring any time prior to final fascial closure were reported.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"90.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With No Re-bleeding at the Target Bleeding Site","description":"Percentage of participants with no re-bleeding at the TBS were reported.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"85.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) That Were Potentially Related To Bleeding at the TBS","description":"Number of participants With AEs that were potentially related to bleeding at the TBS were reported.
