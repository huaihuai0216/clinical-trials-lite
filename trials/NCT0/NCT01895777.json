Examples may include unwarranted radiation exposure as a result of a repeat CT scan at day 84 for a patient with an isolated case of pulmonary embolism evaluated at baseline solely by a CT scan. In such cases, the baseline radiological assessment (e.g. CT) may be supplemented with an acceptable non-radiological assessment at baseline (e.g. MRI) which could then be repeated at day 84 hence alleviating any potential unwarranted radiation exposure.\n* Further exclusion criteria apply","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Composite Primary Endpoint","description":"The primary endpoint was the combined endpoint of the proportions of patients with:\n\n* Complete thrombus resolution\n* Freedom from recurrent VTE\n* Freedom from mortality related to VTE.
