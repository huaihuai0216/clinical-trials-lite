Standardized uptake value ratio SUVR)is the quantitive measure of specific tracer uptake, normalized for the non-specific mean uptake in a reference region. SUVR is calculated as SUV\\_voi/SUV\\_ref with SUV being the integrated activity over a given time period for the volume of interest (SUV\\_voi) or reference region (SUV\\_ref). VOI means volume of interest and REF means reference region.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.59","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.56","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.07","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.39","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.00","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.77","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.93","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.32","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.08","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.18","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"0.86","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.36","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.44","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.81","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.27","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.78","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.32","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.71","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.74","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.08","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.35","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.45","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.56","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.63","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.52","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.32","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.99","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.84","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.36","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.35","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.33","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.40","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.73","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.73","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.48","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.39","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.74","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.62","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1.34","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"1.34","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Comparsion Between Brain Uptake of [18F] Flutemetamol Amyloid Level From Immunohistochemistry Assay and a Stained Biopsy Tissue Specimen.","description":"This was an amyloid level estimate measured by Immunohistochemistry assay to determine the percentage of plaque area for mAb NAB228.
