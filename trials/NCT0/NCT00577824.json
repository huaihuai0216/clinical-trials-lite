In a patient receiving SU alone, the dose must be within the dose range from maximum maintenance dose to maximum approved dose. The patients with concomitant use of alpha glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, voglibose or miglitol) or meglitinide derivatives (mitiglinide or nateglinide) can be included in this study, but these drugs must be discontinued at study start.\n* Have HbA1c 7.0% to 10% at study start.\n* Have a body weight \\>=50 kg.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.\n* Have participated in this study previously or any other study using exenatide or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs within the last 90 days.\n* Have been treated with any exogenous insulin within 90 days before study start.\n* Have been continuously treated with any drug that directly affects gastrointestinal motility for more than a total of 21 days in the 90 days prior to study start.\n* The combination therapy of sulfonylurea, biguanide and thiazolidinedione is not allowed.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"75
