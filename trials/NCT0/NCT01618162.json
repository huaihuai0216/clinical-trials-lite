1)\n* Use of any drug (other than SU in monotherapy or in combination with metformin), which in the Investigators opinion could interfere with the blood glucose level (e.g. systemic corticosteroids)\n* Previous treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (e.g. exenatide, liraglutide)\n* Treatment with any insulin regimen (short term treatment due to

active (during the past 12 months) disease of the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrinological (except for the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus),neurological, genitourinary or haematological system that in
