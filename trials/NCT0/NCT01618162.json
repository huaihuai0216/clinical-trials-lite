The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/liraglutide in insulin naïve subjects inadequately controlled with SU (sulphonylurea) alone or in combination with metformin. All subjects will continue their pre-trial SU treatment with or without metformin treatment without changing the frequency or dose throughout the trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Week 0, Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IDegLira","deltaMin":-1.45,"sd":0.84},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.46,"sd":0.83}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":87,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Canada","Germany","India","Israel","Puerto Rico","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28332144","27589252","39963952"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":288},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Lipase increased","Dyslipidaemia","Headache","Influenza"]}}
