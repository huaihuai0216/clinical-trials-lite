However, eligible subjects must be outpatients at the beginning of Phase 3.\n\nSubjects will be assessed weekly during Phase 1, weekly for the first 4 weeks of Phase 2 and 3, and biweekly for the remaining weeks during each of Phases 2 and 3. Subjects will be encouraged to call the investigators with any exacerbation of psychotic symptoms and/or any tolerability issues. The investigator will also have the option to phone the subjects and their guardian(s) at any time to ensure clinical stability.\n\nA data monitoring committee (DMC) will provide oversight for safety monitoring and reviewing the interim analysis. One interim analysis is planned after 75% of the total expected number of impending relapse events (28 events) are achieved and will be conducted by an independent data analysis center. The DMC will make a recommendation about stopping or continuing the study based on safety and efficacy reviews. The results of the interim analysis and individual subject data will remain blinded to the sponsor during the course of the study until the DMC determines that the study will conclude based on the results of the interim analysis, or the study is completed after 37 endpoint events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Relapse Rate (in Percent) From Randomization to Exacerbation of Psychotic Symptoms/Impending Relapse.","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 52/End of Phase 3 visit.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aripiprazole-Double Blind Maintenance","deltaMin":19.39,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo-Double Blind Maintenance","deltaMin":37.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0161"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["United States","India","Malaysia","Philippines","Romania","Russia","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28838583"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":186},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Headache","Akathisia","Somnolence","Weight increased"]}}
