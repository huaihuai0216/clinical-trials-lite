childbearing potential (WOCBP) not willing to use highly effective method(s) of birth control during the study treatment period and the follow-up period, or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy during the study.\n* Treatment with a sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Empagliflozin) during the last 12 months.\n* Uncontrolled high blood pressure.\n* Participants with severe anemia, severe cardiovascular (including congestive heart failure New York Heart Association IV), respiratory, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, or active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease or patients with short life expectancy that, according to the Investigator, will preclude their safe participation in this study, or will make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult.\n* Lower extremity complications (such as skin ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis and gangrene) identified during the Screening period, and still requiring treatment at Randomization.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a
