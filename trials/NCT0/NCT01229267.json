The primary hypothesis is that vaccination with V212 vaccine will reduce the incidence of herpes zoster (HZ) compared to placebo when administered to recipients of HCT. The statistical criterion for success requires that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the estimated vaccine efficacy in the V212 recipients (excluding the high-antigen lot) compared with that in the placebo recipients is \\>25%.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Confirmed Herpes-Zoster","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V212 Consistency Lots","deltaMin":32.889,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":91.883,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["32665955","31721601","29856344"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":420,"n":657},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Pyrexia","Mucosal inflammation","Thrombocytopenia"]}}
