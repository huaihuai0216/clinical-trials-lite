This study is a randomized study of first-time kidney transplant patients who have worsening kidney function and biopsy proven grade 2 or 3 interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA). Patients must be eligible to get a second transplant. They must have completed or be actively undergoing evaluation for re-listing for a second transplant. Patients will be randomized to either convert to belatacept or continue on calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Donor-specific Antibody Formation","timeFrame":"Month 36","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Belatacept Treatment Group","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":6},"commonTop":["Diarrhea, grade 1","Peritonitis, grade 2","Diarrhea, grade 2","Chest pain, grade 1","Otitis media, grade 2"]}}
