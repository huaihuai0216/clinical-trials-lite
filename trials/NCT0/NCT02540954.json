Charts are organized in 14 lines of decreasing size with 5 letters each. Participants reading up to 19 letters at 4 meters were tested at 1 meter to read the first 6 lines. The score equals the sum of letters read at 1 meter and 4 meters. If more than 19 letters are read at 4 meters the score equals the number of letters read plus 30. The score range is 0 to 100, and a higher score represents better visual function.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.3","spread":"7.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.5","spread":"8.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Vision in the Study Eye","description":"A participant was classified as maintaining vision if the participant had lost fewer than 15 letters in the ETDRS letter score compared to baseline.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"94.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Gained From Baseline 5 or More Letters in the Study Eye","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) in the Study Eye","description":"Retinal characteristic was evaluated using Optical coherence tomography (OCT).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-24.4","spread":"55.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-33.4","spread":"47.1"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline in Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) Area in the Study Eye","description":"Choroidal neovascularization measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.274","spread":"2.723"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.204","spread":"2.813"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Lost From Baseline 30 or More Letters in the Study Eye","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline in Total Score for National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function (NEI VFQ-25) Questionnaire","description":"National Eye Institute 25-Item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) total score ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the best possible score and 0 represents the worst.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.186","spread":"9.601"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.694","spread":"10.328"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)","description":null,"paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"130","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"124","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":167},"commonTop":["Cataract","Subretinal fluid","Visual acuity reduced","Choroidal neovascularisation","Neovascular age-related macular degeneration"]}}}
