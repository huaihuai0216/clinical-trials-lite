The application of Methylaminolevulinate (MAL) on individual lesions followed by the application of a plastic film on each lesion is difficult and takes time for subjects with many actinic keratoses. The waiting period of 3 hours between MAL cream application and red light exposure is also long for patients. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with MAL with a shorter cream application time (90 minutes) and when MAL is applied on the entire face without the plastic film.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Number of Facial Actinic Keratoses at Week 12","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MAL-PDT 90 Min Incubation, no Occlusion","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":2.32}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["1550366"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":20},"commonTop":["Erythema application site","Common Cold","Burning sensation on forehead","Vitreous detachment left eye","Crusting application site"]}}
