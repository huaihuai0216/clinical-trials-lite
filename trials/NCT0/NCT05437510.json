The study also included a 12-month (Day 366) follow-up telephone call. The D366 follow-up telephone call was the final follow-up telephone call for France, Germany and UK non-reconsented participants. The study included an 18-month (D546) and a 24-month (D731, final telephone call) follow-up telephone call for UK reconsented participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) Hospitalization Through the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Season","timeFrame":"From dosing/randomization (Day 1) up to approximately 7 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nirsevimab","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"No Intervention","deltaMin":64,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"0 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":240,"countries":["France","Germany","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40379431","38157500"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":262,"n":4016},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}
