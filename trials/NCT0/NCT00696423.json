investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding booster vaccination, or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the booster dose.\n* Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 days prior to vaccination, or planned administration during the study period, with the exception of measles or combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational product.\n* Previous booster vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and/or Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases since the end of the primary study.\n* History of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and/or Haemophilus influenzae type b diseases.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s).\n* Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.\n* History of any progressive neurological disorders or seizures.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at time of enrolment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the booster dose or planned administration during the study period.\n* Occurrence of any of the following adverse events (AEs) after previous administration of a diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine:\n\n  * Hypersensitivity reaction due to any component of the vaccine.\n  * Encephalopathy.\n  * Fever ≥ 40.0 °C (axillary temperature) within 48 hours of vaccination.\n  * Collapse or shock-like state within 48 hours of vaccination.\n  * Persistent, inconsolable crying occurring within 48 hours of vaccination and lasting ≥ 3 hours.\n  * Seizures with or without fever occurring within 3 days of vaccination.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Months","maximumAge":"24
