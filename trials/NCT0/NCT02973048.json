Despite effective surgical anesthesia, bupivacaine is associated with long duration motor block and dose-dependent maternal hypotension potentially harmful for the fetus. Prilocaine with its new 2% hyperbaric formulation (HP), developed recently, showed rapid onset of action and faster regression of motor block compared to other local anesthetics without noteworthy side-effects when used intrathecally. The aim of this randomized, multicenter, powered clinical trial is to investigate whether HP may be an efficient alternative to hyperbaric bupivacaine for scheduled caesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia, with more rapid rehabilitation and less adverse effects. Our hypothesis is that hyperbaric prilocaine offers shorter motor block and more rapid rehabilitation than bupivacaine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Regression of Motor Block","timeFrame":"until complete regression of motor block (up to 4 hours)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hyperbaric Bupivacaine","deltaMin":180,"sd":null},{"arm":"Hyperbaric Prilocaine","deltaMin":130,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Belgium"]},"refs":{"pmids":["14570791","24906303","27044397","34101713"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":["Nausea","Transient neurologic symptoms"]}}
