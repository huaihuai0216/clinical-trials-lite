Creatinine clearance rate is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Creatinine clearance can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. For this study, the creatinine clearance rate was calculated using the Nankivell formula. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 ml/min and for females 90-125 ml/min. A low creatinine clearance indicates poor kidney function.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"56.800","spread":"21.522"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"53.449","spread":"15.497"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Patients With Acute Rejection","description":"The diagnosis of acute rejection was made via kidney biopsy (Banff criteria).
