Each question that is answered with a No receives a score of 1. The possible scoring range is therefore 0 to 4. Higher scores correlate with better medical adherence. For the purpose of evaluating percent of participants adherent to therapy, the variable was dichotomized to \"Adherent\" or \"Non-adherent\". Any response of Yes to one of the 4 items was scored as \"Non-Adherent\".","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"67","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":25},"commonTop":[]}}}
