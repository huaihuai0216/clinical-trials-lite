In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.2","spread":"1.69"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.1","spread":"1.53"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Visits at Which Participants Achieved an IGA Score of Cleared (0) From Week 28 Through Week 40","description":"The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants psoriasis at a given time point.
