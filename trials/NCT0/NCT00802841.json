In this study, the efficacy of nilotinib 400mg BID will be compared to imatinib 600mg QD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR)","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Nilotinib","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"Imatinib","deltaMin":42.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3106"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":56,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","China","Colombia","Germany","Guatemala","India","Mexico","Panama","Poland","Russia","Venezuela"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27890073"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":96},"commonTop":["Thrombocytopenia","Neutropenia","Anaemia","Leukopenia","Rash"]}}
