The secondary objectives of the study are to assess overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR) through the end of Week 24, objective response rate (ORR) and PFS on subsequent therapy (PFS2) in participants treated with veliparib in combination with C/P versus placebo in combination with C/P.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"From randomization until the primary analysis data cut-off date of 05 April 2019; the median duration of follow-up was 35.5 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo + C/P","deltaMin":12.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Veliparib + C/P","deltaMin":14.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.003"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":219,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belarus","Belgium","Canada","Chile","Colombia","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Mexico","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Romania","Russia","Singapore","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35403245","34917174","34243076","34131001","32861273"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":68,"n":174},"commonTop":["NEUTROPENIA","THROMBOCYTOPENIA","ANAEMIA","NAUSEA","ALOPECIA"]}}
