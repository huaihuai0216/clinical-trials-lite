hours of urinary symptoms attributable to a UTI\n* Two of the following signs and symptoms of uUTI: urinary frequency, urinary urgency, pain or burning on micturition, suprapubic pain.\n* A mid-stream urine specimen with evidence of pyuria as defined by either a machine-read dipstick positive for leukocyte esterase OR at least 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter on microscopic analysis of unspun urine OR white blood cell count ≥10 cells/high-powered field (HPF) in the sediment of a spun urine\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence of signs and symptoms suggestive of acute pyelonephritis defined as: fever (temperature \\> 38° Celsius), chills, costovertebral angle tenderness, flank pain, nausea, and/or vomiting\n* Receipt of antibacterial drug therapy potentially effective as treatment of uUTI within the prior 7 days\n* Concurrent use of non-study treatments that would have a potential effect on outcome evaluations in patients with uUTI, including analgesics (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, paracetamol etc.), phenazopyridine, and cranberry products.\n* Any anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract, including surgically modified urinary tract anatomy, and obstructive uropathy due to nephrolithiasis, stricture, tumor, or fibrosis\n* Ongoing urinary retention\n* Neurogenic bladder\n* Current resident of a long-term care facility\n* Instrumentation of urinary tract in the previous 30 days\n* An indwelling urinary catheter, ureteral stent or other foreign material in the urinary tract\n* Any history of trauma to the pelvis or urinary tract\n* Receiving hemodialysis, hemofiltration, peritoneal dialysis, or had a renal transplant\n* History of allergy or hypersensitivity to carbapenems, β-lactams or probenecid, as formulated
