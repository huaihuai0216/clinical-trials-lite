Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment. A negative mean percentage change from baseline indicates improvement.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-67.1","spread":"28.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-82.4","spread":"31.13"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-68.7","spread":"32.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-74.8","spread":"42.19"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-66.9","spread":"29.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-63.2","spread":"42.65"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-65.4","spread":"34.64"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-58.1","spread":"53.40"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-74.2","spread":"24.25"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-53.8","spread":"56.21"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Percent Change From Baseline in EuroQOL 5-Dimension Health Status Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Health State Assessment (From 0 to 100)","description":"The EQ-5D is an instrument used to assess a participant's health status. The instrument includes a descriptive profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). The descriptive profile includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension had 3 response levels: no problems, some problems and severe problems. The VAS is a vertical scale that assesses the health status from 0 (worst possible health state) to 100 (best possible health state). This outcome measures the percent change in VAS score. Positive mean percent changes indicate improvement.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"71.0","spread":"157.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"73.1","spread":"99.42"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.9","spread":"153.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"57.5","spread":"98.10"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"74.6","spread":"171.69"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45.3","spread":"82.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"80.2","spread":"177.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.9","spread":"80.96"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"87.2","spread":"173.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"41.3","spread":"86.92"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Developed Anti-secukinumab Antibodies","description":"The development of anti-secunimubab anti-bodies would decrease a participant's ability to respond to secukinumab treatment.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Relationship Between Response to AIN457 and Failed Response to Previous Biologic Psoriasis Therapy","description":"This outcome measure was not analyzed due to the small sample size of the study (43 participants).","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["NASOPHARYNGITIS","PHARYNGITIS","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","FOLLICULITIS","INTERTRIGO"]}}}
