Participants will be recruited and enrolled, either to Study A or B, over the first three years. Participants enrolled in Study A will be followed for at least 5 years, while those enrolled in Study B will be followed for five-to-eight years, with the average length of follow-up being six and a half years. The two concurrent randomized clinical trials differ by eligibility criteria, interventions and outcomes to be studied.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Study A: Percent Annual Change in Total Kidney Volume","timeFrame":"Baseline and 2-, 4- and 5-year follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ACE-I + ARB","deltaMin":6,"sd":null},{"arm":"ACE-I Alone","deltaMin":6.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Low Blood Pressure Group","deltaMin":5.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard Blood Pressure Group","deltaMin":6.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.52"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39356039","36918388","30803434","25399733","25111236","22205355"],"seeAlso":["http://www.pkdcure.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":58,"n":273},"commonTop":["Acute kidney injury","Hyperkalemia"]}}
