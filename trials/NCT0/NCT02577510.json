If a patient wish/insist on participating in the study, and pregnancy status is unclear, a urine pregnancy test will be offered. Also risk of Lidocaine in pregnancy will be discussed with the patient as currently classified. We will convey that this risk is currently classified as a Risk Class B, which means that animal-reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant women. We will also discuss that animal-reproduction studies have shown an decrease in maternal fertility), but that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters,\n* prior surgery in the hip and lateral leg region\n* prior lumbar surgery\n* previous pelvic fracture\n* previous L1, L2 or L3 lumbar radiculopathy, plexopathy or meralgia paresthetica\n* chronic pain syndromes requiring opioid intake","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Anesthesia Related Time","description":"The main outcome will be the total anesthesia-related time, defined as the sum of performance and onset times","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"554","spread":"366.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"480","spread":"251.9"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Success Rate","description":"percentage of patients with successful block","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Needle Pass","description":"how often needle changes angle to make target","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.5","spread":"12.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.2","spread":"2.9"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Pain With Procedure","description":"visual analogue scale- 0-10 - 0 is equal to no pain, while 10 is equal to maximum pain","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.0","spread":"2.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.6","spread":"2.2"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":21},"commonTop":["Femoral Block"]}}}
