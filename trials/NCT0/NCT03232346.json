The first phase includes a 4--week period of stabilization on buprenorphine 4--8 mg at the research clinic to assure that patients are stable, compliant, and free from illicit opioids. Participants that meet the above criteria will be randomized 1:1 to: 1) buprenorphine discontinuation and outpatient transition to XR--NTX with 3 monthly injections, or 2) buprenorphine discontinuation using a gradual 5-week long taper. In both groups participants will receive weekly relapse prevention therapy and will be monitored for the duration of the trial, which is 25 weeks post randomization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent of Patients Successfully Transitioned Off Buprenorphine","timeFrame":"Week 25","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regimen 1","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen 2","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":[]}}
