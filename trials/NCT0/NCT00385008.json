Other exclusion criteria included use of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 2 weeks before screening; ergot prophylactics in past 3 months; anticoagulants; smoking more than 10 cigarettes/day, evidence of alcohol or substance abuse; GI bleeding disorders, inflammatory bowel disease; or any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's opinion could affect interpretation of efficacy or safety information or which otherwise contraindicated participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to 10%, 50%, 90% and Complete Gastric Empting of the Radioactive Markers Representing Sumatriptan, Naproxen and Eletriptan","description":"Scintigraphic images were analyzed in a time-lapse format and regions of interest were drawn to include the stomach and small intestine.
