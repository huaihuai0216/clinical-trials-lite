Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using bicalutamide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known if radiation therapy is more effective with or without bicalutamide for prostate cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without bicalutamide in treating patients who have stage II or stage III prostate cancer and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels following radical prostatectomy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (12-year Rates Reported)","timeFrame":"From date of randomization to 12 years.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":71.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bicalutamide","deltaMin":76.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.020"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":240,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28146658","36120850","35790016","35737923","33570548","32215583"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":84,"n":382},"commonTop":["Acute RT Toxicity: Bowel: NOS","Bladder/GU: NOS","Bowel/GI: NOS","Acute RT Toxicity: Bladder: NOS","Gynecomastia: NOS"]}}
