In osimertinib treated subjects, T790 testing is not required.\n* No evidence of exon 20 T790M mutation obtained at progression on prior first- or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy. For participants who were treated with osimertinib, T790M testing is not required.\n* Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)\n* Available tumor sample for Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemical (IHC).\n* Participants are eligible if central nervous system (CNS) metastases are considered to be adequately controlled/treated before or during the screening period and participants are neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. In addition, participants must be either off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤10 mg daily prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization). Participants with asymptomatic CNS metastasis are eligible.\n* Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-1\n* Life expectancy is at least 3 months\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known EGFR mutation, T790M positive who failed 1L first- or second-generation TKI should receive osimertinib first as the standard of care (SOC). These participants are only eligible if they fail osimertinib as 2L.\n* who have progressed within 3 months of the first dose of 1L or 2L EGFR TKI.\n* Carcinomatous meningitis\n* Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease are excluded\n* ALK translocation\n* Known SCLC transformation\n* Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways\n\nOther protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria apply","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Centralized Review (BICR)","description":"PFS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented tumor progression, as determined by BICR (per RECIST v1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.\n\nParticipants who died without reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death.
