It was developed specifically for participants with cystic fibrosis. It is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, perceived well-being, and symptoms. The respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms like coughing, congestion, wheezing etc. Scaling of each item is done via 4-point Likert scales. Scores for each item are summed up to generate a domain score. Scores ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health and lower scores indicating worse health.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.760","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.032","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Body Mass Index (BMI) at Week 48","description":"Malnutrition is common in participants with cystic fibrosis.

An SAE is an untoward medical occurrence or effect associated with the use of a study drug at any dose, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the study drug, which results in one of the following: death; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; life threatening adverse event; persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; any other medically important event; or a pregnancy resulting in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"133","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"135","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"46","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With TEAEs by Severity and Relationship to Study Drugs","description":"The relationship of TEAEs to the study drugs were assessed as: probable related, possibly related, unlikely related, and unrelated.
