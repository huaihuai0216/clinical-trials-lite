FIX activity was measured at a central laboratory using validated one-stage clotting method. Recovery values were baseline-corrected for pre-infusion plasma FIX activity. Incremental recovery was measured following a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP on Day 1. Analysis of previous FIX product was conducted at the beginning of the study in a subset of subjects who had no historical pharmacokinetic (PK) data of their previous FIX product. For the PK assessment, the previous FIX product was administered by IV infusion after approximately 4 days following the last FIX treatment, prior to any dosing of rIX-FP. The formal PK population consisted of subjects who received at least 1 dose of rIX-FP for PK assessment and for whom a sufficient number of analyzable PK samples had been obtained to permit the evaluation of the PK profile of rIX-FP.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.0114","spread":"0.22711"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.9506","spread":"0.20432"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.0600","spread":"0.23934"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7379","spread":"0.19768"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6764","spread":"0.13980"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.7925","spread":"0.23219"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Half-life (t1/2) Following a Single Intravenous Dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP or Previous FIX Product","description":"FIX activity was measured at a central laboratory using validated one-stage clotting method.
