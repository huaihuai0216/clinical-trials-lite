The CBT and pharmacotherapy will be contrasted with relaxation training and placebo medication. One hundred and eighty participants will be recruited and, subsequent to a platform of outpatient treatment for alcoholism, will be randomly assigned to a 12-week treatment condition. All treatment conditions will begin with a 1-week placebo run-in, after which participants will begin a trial of venlafaxine or placebo. The treatments will conclude with a 2-week medication/placebo taper. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at post-treatment and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months. The long-term objectives of this research are to develop a real-world combination of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for patients with comorbid alcohol-use and anxiety disorders that compromise prognosis, and to evaluate the effectiveness of combined psychosocial and pharmacological treatments that target anxiety among patients with this comorbidity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical Global Impression Scale-I (CGI-I)","timeFrame":"Session 1 (Baseline) , Session 8 (8 weeks of treatment), Session 11 (11 weeks of treatment)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Venlafaxine & CBT","deltaMin":3.65,"sd":1.34},{"arm":"Placebo & CBT","deltaMin":3.81,"sd":1.21},{"arm":"Venlafaxine & PMR","deltaMin":3.86,"sd":1.1},{"arm":"Placebo & PMR","deltaMin":4.05,"sd":0.65}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":24},"commonTop":[]}}
