History of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring treatment with medium-to-high dose ICS (\\>250μg fluticasone dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose) and a LABA, for at least 12 months prior to Visit 1\n4. Documented treatment with ICS and LABA for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 with or without oral corticosteroids and additional asthma controllers.\n\n   * For subjects 18 years of age and older, the ICS dose must be \\>500 mcg/day fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily.\n   * For subjects ages 12-17, the ICS dose must be ≥500 mcg /day fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma (e.g. active lung infection, COPD, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other than asthma, that are associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg- Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome)\n2.

Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral medication within 30 days prior to the date informed consent is obtained or during the screening/run-in period\n4. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs, haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening/run-in period, which in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Annual Asthma Exacerbation Rate in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Uncontrolled Asthma for Eosinophils >=300/uL","description":"The annual exacerbation rate is based on unadjudicated annual exacerbation rate reported by the investigator in the eCRF","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.73","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.33","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Annual Asthma Exacerbation Rate in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Uncontrolled Asthma for Eosinophils < 300/uL","description":"The annual exacerbation rate is based on unadjudicated annual exacerbation rate reported by the investigator in the eCRF","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.85","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.00","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.21","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Annual Asthma Exacerbation Rate Resulting Emergency Room Visits and Hospitalizations","description":"The annual exacerbation rate associated with an emergency room visit or a hospitalization (adjudicated)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.06","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.18","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Patients With >=1 Asthma Exacerbations","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100","spread":"84.227"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"93","spread":"72.002"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"135","spread":"74.434"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to First Asthma Exacerbation","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":"84.227"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":"72.002"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"300","spread":"74.434"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (L) Value for Baseline Eosinophils >=300/uL","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.353","spread":"0.503"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.398","spread":"0.546"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.237","spread":"0.508"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 (L) Value for Baseline Eosinophils <300/uL","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.115","spread":"0.417"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.238","spread":"0.483"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.140","spread":"0.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Asthma Symptom Score for Baseline Eosinophils >=300/uL","description":"Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary.
