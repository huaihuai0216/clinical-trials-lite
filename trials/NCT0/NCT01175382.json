Community-dwelling men\n2. Age 40 years or older\n3. Patient-reported urgency and 9.0 or more voids per 24-hour day (on average) on the 7-day baseline bladder diary.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Urinary flow rate \\< 8.0 mL/sec on a void greater than 125 ml.\n2. Post-void residual volume greater than 150 mL (based on bladder ultrasound after voiding in the presence of a normal urge to urinate).\n3. Urinary tract infection (defined as growth of greater than 10,000 colonies per ml of a urinary pathogen on urine culture). Patients will be referred for treatment with antibiotics and may be enrolled if OAB symptoms persist after the infection is resolved.\n4. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), simple prostatectomy, or other benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) related surgery within the past 5 years.\n5. Current active treatment for prostate cancer.\n6. History of radical prostatectomy.\n7. Previous artificial urinary sphincter, sling procedure, bladder-injection of botulinum toxin, or implanted sacral neuromodulation device.\n8. Poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin \\>9.0 within last 3 months). Subjects with poorly controlled diabetes will be offered enrollment if the OAB symptoms persist after the diabetes is controlled appropriately.\n9. Hematuria on microscopic examination in the absence of infection. A urologic consultation will be recommended and enrollment will depend on clearance by a urologist and agreement by the Site PI that entry into the treatment protocol is not contraindicated.\n10. Any unstable medical condition (particularly: cancers under active treatment, decompensated congestive heart failure, history of malignant arrhythmias, unstable angina, diagnosed by history or physical exam).\n11. Neurologic conditions such as Parkinson's, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or myasthenia gravis.\n12. Impaired mental status. Patients who screen as probable dementia on the Mini-Cog.\n13. Contraindications to the study drugs (tolterodine and tamsulosin) including history of postural hypotension with syncope, history of acute urinary retention requiring catheterization, narrow angle glaucoma, or history of gastric retention.\n14. Hypersensitivity to tolterodine or tamsulosin.\n15. Current use of an alpha blocker agent. Evaluation will be delayed until the drug has been discontinued for 2 weeks.\n16. Current use of an anti-muscarinic agent for OAB. Evaluation will be delayed until the drug has been discontinued for 2 weeks.\n17. If on a diuretic, dose has not been stable for at least 4 weeks.\n18. If taking dutasteride or finasteride, dose has not been stable for at least 6 months.\n19. If on an antibiotic for prostatitis. Patients will be offered re-evaluation if OAB symptoms persist when antibiotics are completed.\n20. Full course of behavioral training.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Frequency of Urination After 6-week Intervention (Last Observation Carried Forward)","description":"Bladder diaries completed by subjects prior to randomization and following the first phase of treatment was used to calculate changes in frequency of urination.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.7","spread":"2.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.5","spread":"2.3"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.3","spread":"2.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Frequency of Urination From 6 Weeks to 12 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)","description":"Bladder diaries completed by subjects prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment were used to calculate changes in frequency of urination.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7","spread":"1.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.4","spread":"1.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.2","spread":"1.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Frequency of Urination From Baseline to 12 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)","description":"Bladder diaries completed by subjects prior to randomization and following the second phase of treatment were used to calculate changes in frequency of urination","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.3","spread":"2.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.9","spread":"2.5"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.5","spread":"2.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Urgency From Baseline to 6 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)","description":"Bladder diaries completed prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment will be used to calculate changes in urgency associated with each void and incontinent episode using the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS).
