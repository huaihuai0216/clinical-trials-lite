We hypothesize that combined therapy will result in better outcomes than either behavioral or drug therapy alone. The second aim is to compare two methods of implementing combined therapy: simultaneously as initial therapy vs. stepped therapy, in which therapies are combined following initial behavioral or drug therapy alone. The third aim is to examine the costs and cost-effectiveness of combined behavioral + drug therapy compared to behavioral or drug therapy alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Frequency of Urination After 6-week Intervention (Last Observation Carried Forward)","timeFrame":"From Baseline to 6 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Behavioral Treatment Alone","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":2.4},{"arm":"Drug Therapy (Tolterodine + Tamsulosin)","deltaMin":1.5,"sd":2.3},{"arm":"Combined Behavioral + Drug Therapy","deltaMin":3.3,"sd":2.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37811598","31930360"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":71},"commonTop":[]}}
