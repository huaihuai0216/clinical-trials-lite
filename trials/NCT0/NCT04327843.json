In addition to the novel focus, innovative elements include: 1.) a manualized curriculum that targets specific barriers and facilitators to medication adherence in Tanzanians with CPD, 2.) targeting known, high-risk individuals with CPD (those who miss â‰¥20% of prescribed antipsychotic medication, and 3.) using existing injection clinic health workers to deliver the adherence promotion program. Strengths include the highly generalizable methods and use of LAIs that are available in low-resource settings.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tablets Routine Questionnaire (TRQ)","timeFrame":"Change from Baseline to 6 month visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CAE + LAI Treatment","deltaMin":-57,"sd":60.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Tanzania"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35086504"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":19},"commonTop":["Tremor","Drowsiness","Blurry vision","Restlessness","Muscle pain"]}}
