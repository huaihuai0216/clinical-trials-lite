The diagnosis must be reviewed by the Medical Director prior to enrollment.\n* Subject is 2 years or older at the time of screening.\n* Written informed consent is obtained from either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative prior to any study-related procedures and study product administration.\n* Subject has been receiving a consistent dose of immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a non-Baxter product (Gammunex administered IV, Hizentra, or Privigen), administered in compliance with the respective product information, for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening. The average minimum pre-study dose over that interval was equivalent to 300 mg/kg BW/4 weeks and a maximum dose equivalent to 600 mg/kg BW/4 weeks at a dosing frequency as follows:\n\n  * For IV treatment prior to the study: at mean intervals of 3 or 4 weeks (+/- 3 days) or\n  * For SC treatment prior to the study: at mean intervals of approximately 1 or 2 weeks (+/- 2 days).\n* Subject has a serum trough level of IgG \\> 5 g/L at screening.\n* Subject has not had a serious bacterial infection within the 3 months prior to screening.\n* If female of childbearing potential, subject presents with a negative pregnancy test and agrees to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study.\n* Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject has a known history of or is positive at screening for one or more of the following: hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for hepatitis C virus (HCV), PCR for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Type 1/2.\n* Abnormal laboratory values at screening meeting any one of the following criteria (abnormal tests may be repeated once to determine if they are persistent):\n\n  * Persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) \\> 2.5 times the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory\n  * Persistent severe neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count \\[ANC\\] \\<= 500/mm3).\n* Subject has creatinine clearance (CLcr) value that is \\<60% of normal for age and gender either measured, or calculated according to a gender-specific formula provided in the study protocol.\n* Subject has been diagnosed with or has a malignancy (other than adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix), unless the disease-free period prior to screening exceeds 5 years\n* Subject is receiving anti-coagulation therapy or has a history of thrombotic episodes (including deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary embolism) within 12 months prior to screening or a history of thrombophilia.\n* Subject has abnormal protein loss (protein losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome).\n* Subject has anemia that would preclude phlebotomy for laboratory studies, according to standard practice at the site.\n* Subject has an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or persistent reactions (urticaria, breathing difficulty, severe hypotension, or anaphylaxis) following IV immunoglobulin, SC immunoglobulin, and/or Immune Serum Globulin (ISG) infusions.\n* Subject has immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (IgA less than 0.07g/L) and known anti IgA antibodies.\n* Subject has a known allergy to hyaluronidase.\n* Subject is on preventative (prophylactic) systemic antibacterial antibiotics at doses sufficient to treat or prevent bacterial infections, and cannot stop these antibiotics at the time of screening.\n* Subject has active infection and is receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment of infection at the time of screening.\n* Subject has a bleeding disorder or a platelet count less than 20,000/Î¼L, or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would be at significant risk of increased bleeding or bruising as a result of SC therapy.\n* Subject has total protein \\> 9 g/dL or myeloma, or macroglobulinemia (IgM) or paraproteinemia.\n* Women of childbearing potential meeting any one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Subject presents with a positive pregnancy test\n  * Subject is breast feeding\n  * Subject intends to begin nursing during the course of the study\n  * Subject does not agree to employ adequate birth-control measures (e.g. intrauterine device, diaphragm or condom \\[for male partner\\] with spermicidal jelly or foam, or birth control pills/patches) throughout the course of the study.\n* Subject has participated in another clinical study and has been exposed to an investigational product (IP) or device within 30 days prior to study enrollment (exception: treatment with immunoglobulin pre-study).\n* Subject is scheduled to participate in another (non-Baxter) clinical study involving an IP or device during the course of the study.\n* Subject has severe dermatitis that would preclude adequate sites for safe product administration.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"2
