Male or female subjects between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive.\n2. Have a primary diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy that meets ICSD-3 criteria or DSM-5 criteria, and currently untreated or treated with or without anticataplectics.\n3. If applicable, treated with a stimulant or alerting agent at unchanged doses for at least 2 months prior to dosing or not treated with a stimulant or alerting agent.\n4. Willing and able to comply with the study design schedule and other requirements.\n5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Narcolepsy secondary to another medical condition (e.g., CNS injury or lesion)\n2. History or presence of any unstable or clinically significant medical condition, behavioral or psychiatric disorder (including active suicidal ideation), or history or presence of another neurological disorder or surgical history that might affect the subject's safety and/or interfere with the conduct of the study in the opinion of the Investigator.\n3. Treatment with any central nervous system sedating agents, including but not limited to benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics/ hypnotics/sedatives, neuroleptics, opioids, barbiturates, phenytoin, ethosuximide, or MCT inhibitors, e.g. diclofenac, valproate, ibuprofen, within 2 weeks prior to enrollment (discontinuation for the purpose of study enrollment is permitted only if considered safe by the Investigator and approved by the Medical Monitor).\n4. Treatment with an antidepressant for cataplexy, if the withdrawal of the antidepressant during cross-titration with JZP-258 might be unsafe due to prior history of depression.\n5. Unsafe for the subject to receive placebo treatment for 2 weeks, in the opinion of the Investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Weekly Number of Cataplexy Attacks","description":"Participants completed a daily Cataplexy Frequency Diary each night prior to bedtime.

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions. Participants were asked to rate, on a 4-point scale (0-3), their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different activities. Most participants engaged in those activities at least occasionally, although not necessarily every day. The ESS score (the sum of 8 item scores, 0-3) can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that participants average sleep propensity in daily life (ASP), or their 'daytime sleepiness'.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Worsening Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) for Narcolepsy Overall","description":"At the end of the Double Blind Randomized Withdrawal Period (DB RWP), participants rated the change in their condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = \"very much improved\" to 7 = \"very much worse\" since the last visit.

It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as a psychometrically-based physical and mental overall component summary measures. Two summary scores were derived using the SF-36v2. Physical Component Summary measures dimensions of functional health that are meaningful to respondents, including the impact of health and health-related changes on physical function, pain, and the ability to carry out daily roles. The Mental Component Summary component scale measures the impact of health and health-related changes on well-being, including vitality, social function, and emotional well-being. Participants self-report on items in a summary that have between 2-6 choices per item (e.g. none of the time, some of the time, etc.). Summations of item scores were transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores indicate better health status.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.03","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.92","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.55","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.92","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) Crosswalk Index Score and Visual Analog Scale","description":"The EQ-5D-5L is a measure of health outcome that includes a descriptive system consisting of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/ discomfort, and anxiety/ depression). The EQ-5D-5L includes 5 levels of severity for each of the 5 dimensions of the descriptive system (1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The 5 digit health states for each dimension are converted into a single value per country (0= equivalent to death, 1= equivalent to best imaginable health and values below 0= health states rated worse than death capped at -1), using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk index value calculator as recommended by EuroQol group. A visual analogue scale (VAS) used within this scale recorded the participants self-rated health on a VAS and the endpoints resulted in a numeric value set ranging from 0 (= worst imaginable health state) up to 100 (= best imaginable health state).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.00","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.00","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":201},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Cataplexy","Dizziness","Nasopharyngitis"]}}}
