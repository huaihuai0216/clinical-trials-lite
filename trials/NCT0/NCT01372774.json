Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether stereotactic radiosurgery is more effective than whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases that have been removed by surgery.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies how well stereotactic radiosurgery works compared to whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases that have been removed by surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cognitive Deterioration Free Survival Post-radiation in Patients Who Received SRS Compared to Patients Who Received WBRT","timeFrame":"from baseline up to 5 years post radiation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I - WBRT","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II - SRS","deltaMin":3.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36472389","36264568","28687377"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":14,"n":92},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Nausea","Cognitive disturbance","Hearing impaired","Vomiting"]}}
