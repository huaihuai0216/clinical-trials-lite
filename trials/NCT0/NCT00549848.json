In the rare case that immunophenotype and/or Day-15 MRD is not available, we will make the following assumptions: If immunophenotype is unknown at the time the randomization is to be executed, then it will be assumed B-lineage. If Day-15 MRD is unknown at the time of randomization, then it will be assumed negative (\\<0.01%). Past experience indicate that few patients will fall into these unknown categories.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"90.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Probability of Event-free Survival","description":"To estimate the event-free survival of children with ALL who are treated with risk-directed therapy and to compare the EFS results of TOTXVI with that of TOTXV (NCT00137111).\n\nEFS will be measured from the date of complete response to the date of initial failure for patients who fail.
