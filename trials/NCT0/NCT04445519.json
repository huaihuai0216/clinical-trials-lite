The primary endpoint for the interim analysis was mean diurnal IOP. Subsequent to the interim analysis at Week 2, the NCX 470 0.065% arm was discontinued and the primary analysis only included NCX 470 0.1% vs Latanoprost. The primary efficacy outcome results are reported for the NCX 470 0.1% and Latanoprost 0.005% treatment groups at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. As prespecified in the Statistical Analysis Plan, mean change from baseline in time-matched IOP was not calculated for the 0.065% group.\n\nThe study eye was defined as the eye with the highest mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) value at baseline (or right eye if both eyes had the same IOP value at baseline).
