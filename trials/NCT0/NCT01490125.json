The CDLM asks COPD patients to (i) report their ability to carry out 6 morning activities and (ii) rate the difficulty in performing those activities on a five point Likert-type scale ranging from \"not at all difficult\" to \"extremely difficult\". For each of the six morning activities a score ranging from 0 (=so difficult that they could not carry out the activity by themselves) to 5 (not at all difficult to carry out the activity by themselves) is calculated by using the responses from the two questions for each activity. Daily CDLM is calculated using the scores average from the 6 morning activities. CDLM is calculated as the average daily CDLM score over 6 weeks of treatment. The change from baseline in CDLM score over 6 weeks is analyzed using a MIXED model with baseline CDLM score as a covariate. A CDLM score of 0.20 is considered to be a minimal clinically important difference.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.09","spread":"0.020"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.08","spread":"0.020"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.01","spread":"0.020"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Mean Daily Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Used Over the 6 Weeks of Treatment","description":"The number of puffs of rescue medication taken by participants, were collected each day during the study via entries in e-diaries","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.02","spread":"0.202"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.57","spread":"0.202"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.41","spread":"0.203"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":223},"commonTop":["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Dyspnoea","Headache"]}}}
