Identify how often vitamin D levels are low in patients with new onset Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).\n2. Record the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level (which reflects the average blood sugar level over the past few months) and document insulin requirements before and after vitamin supplementation is given.\n\nHypothesis: Maintaining vitamin D levels \\>30 ng/ml will decrease HbA1c and insulin requirements.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Hemoglobin A1c","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Those Requiring Vit D Supplement","deltaMin":2.67,"sd":0.58},{"arm":"No Vitamin D Supplementation","deltaMin":1.05,"sd":0.58}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":37},"commonTop":[]}}
