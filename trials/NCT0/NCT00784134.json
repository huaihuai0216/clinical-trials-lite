This application requests funding for five years to initiate a Phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the benefit of clot removal for intraventricular hemorrhage. The investigators propose to compare extraventricular drainage (EVD) use plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA; Alteplase; Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) with EVD+ placebo in the management and treatment of subjects with small intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and large intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH defined as ICH \\< 30 cc and obstruction of the 3rd or 4th ventricles by intraventricular blood clot).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <=3 - Dichotomized Analysis","timeFrame":"180 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Alteplase","deltaMin":47.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Saline Placebo","deltaMin":44.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.554"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.465"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":81,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Canada","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35086362","32026447","31571176","31177984","28887375","28081952","26243227"],"seeAlso":["http://braininjuryoutcomes.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":114,"n":249},"commonTop":["Fever","Pneumonia","Intracranial hypertension","Intracranial hemorrhage: Catheter Tract, New","Urinary tract infection"]}}
