In the study, patients are assigned to receive surgery +/- radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy depending on their risk of recurrence. Sometimes, after surgery, the tumor may not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Probability for Event Free Survival.","timeFrame":"5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: No Adjuvant Treatment","deltaMin":0.8984,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Low Risk; Adjuvant Radiotherapy","deltaMin":0.7647,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C: Intermediate & High Risk; Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy","deltaMin":0.6079,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm D: Intermediate & High Risk; Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy","deltaMin":0.4873,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":24,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":187,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36566574","34623899","33548339","31786124","30954717","28391003"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":205},"commonTop":["Encephalopathy","Hypotension","Cardiac disorders - Other, specify","Dermatitis radiation","Diarrhea"]}}
