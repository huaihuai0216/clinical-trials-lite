The design is double-blind, within-subject, with three arms: participants will receive one of three treatments at three separate study visits: aspirin, acetaminophen, and placebo, followed by completion of a maximal exercise test.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time-to-exhaustion","timeFrame":"from start of exercise test until self-reported exhaustion, up to 30 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":551.7,"sd":78.4},{"arm":"Aspirin","deltaMin":331.6,"sd":76.6},{"arm":"Acetaminophen","deltaMin":578.2,"sd":82.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29076760","33191260"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
