In the double-blind phase \"time to sJIA flare\" will be evaluated as primary endpoint and subjects will be discontinued once they experience sJIA flare. An interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be conducted when at least 20 flares have been observed. If either criterion is met, the study will be stopped. If neither criterion is met, the study will continue until the requisite number of flares are observed as determined by the number of flares included in the interim analysis and a statistical penalty for conducting the interim analysis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) Disease Flare: Double-Blind Phase","timeFrame":"From randomization up to 248 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tofacitinib 5mg BID DB","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo DB","deltaMin":295,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.1171"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":52,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Costa Rica","Germany","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Poland","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://pmiform.com/clinical-trial-info-request?StudyID=A3921165"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":100},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Still's disease","Pyrexia","Nasopharyngitis","Vomiting"]}}
