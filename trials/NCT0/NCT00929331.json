All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e. oral temperature \\<38.0°C.\n* Significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness. \"Uncontrolled\" is defined as:\n\nRequiring institution of new medical or surgical treatment within one (1) month prior to study enrollment, or Requiring the re-institution of a previously discontinued medication or medical treatment within one month prior to study enrollment, or Requiring a change in medication dosage in the one month prior to study enrollment due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a SAE within one month prior to study enrollment.\n\n• Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition including: History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, Cancer or treatment for cancer, within 3 years of study enrollment. Persons with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for 3 years or more are eligible.\n\n* History of renal impairment.\n* History of hepatic dysfunction due to hepatitis B, C or toxins including alcohol.\n* Complicated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n* Unstable cardiopulmonary disease requiring chronic medical therapy or associated with functional impairment.\n* Presence of blood dyscrasias, including hemoglobinopathies and myelo- or lymphoproliferative disorder.\n* Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month of study enrollment, or any cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs within six months of study enrollment.

Subjects who receive such treatment after enrollment will be followed per protocol and included in the safety analysis, but excluded from the according-to-protocol cohort.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral® and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to constituent of the vaccine.\n* A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination.\n* Lactating/nursing female.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies","description":"Data are displayed as GMTs for each of the three influenza virus vaccine strains: A/Brisbane(H1N1); A/Uruguay(H3N2); B/Brisbane.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"22.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"33.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45.9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"GMTs of HI Antibodies","description":"Data are displayed as GMTs for each of the three influenza virus vaccine strains: A/Brisbane(H1N1); A/Uruguay(H3N2); B/Brisbane.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"139.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"273.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"141.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"230.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"131.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With a Serum HI Titer Equal to or Above the Cut-off Value","description":"The cut-off value was defined as a serum HI titer \\>= 1:40, which is usually accepted as indicating protection.
