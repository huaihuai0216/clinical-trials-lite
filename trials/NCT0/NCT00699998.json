Anginal Frequency was assessed using Q3 and Q4 which consists of a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6 (higher values equals better quality of life) to assess how often a patient is having symptoms now. Physical limitations was assessed using Q1 which contains 9 items each assessed via Likert scale ranging from 1 to 6 (higher values equals better quality of life) to assess how much a participant's condition is hampering their ability to do what they want to do. Scale scores are transformed to a 0-100 by subtracting the lowest possible score, dividing by the range of the scale, and multiplying by 100.
