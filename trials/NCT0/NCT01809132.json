The current standard of care is treatment with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone). This will be compared to treatment with anakinra, pentoxifylline, plus zinc sulfate. The participants will be treated and followed for 6 months and the two treatment groups will be compared for differences in death rates and laboratory tests that measure liver and gut function.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"180 Days Mortality","timeFrame":"Time to event up to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Anakinra & Pentoxifylline & Zinc Sulfate","deltaMin":17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Methylprednisolone","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Observational","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".30"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37011138","35340032","35084335","31811953"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":33,"n":53},"commonTop":["Ascites","Nausea","Urinary tract infection","Hematemesis","C. difficile infection"]}}
