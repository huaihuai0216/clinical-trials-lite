Alfuzosin is a once daily (10 mg capsule), FDA approved medication for an indication in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The effectiveness of alfuzosin in improving lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with BPH has been documented in a number of placebo-controlled studies. A number of small studies have also suggested that alfuzosin ameliorates CP/CPPS symptoms through a similar alpha-blockade mechanism. This study will enable further testing of this hypothesis","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Decline in Total Score ≥4 for the NIH-CPSI Total Score From Baseline to 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"Baseline and 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Alfuzosin","deltaMin":68,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":66,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.99"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15492337","12521581","15364307","12131316","12031372","12521576","19092152"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":138},"commonTop":["Pain in any body system","Gastrointestinal events","Neurologic events","Constitutional events"]}}
