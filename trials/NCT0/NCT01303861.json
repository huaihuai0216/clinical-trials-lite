These NRT \"non-responders\" are switched (in double-blind fashion) before the quit date to receive either varenicline alone or varenicline paired with bupropion. Some participants who would otherwise have failed at their quit smoking attempt could be \"rescued\" by switching to alternative pharmacotherapies. The proposed study will evaluate the combination treatment against varenicline alone in an adaptive trial design","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Four-week Continuous Abstinence From Cigarette Smoking","timeFrame":"Study week 8 thru week 11","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Varenicline","deltaMin":25.93,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nicotine Patches Only","deltaMin":46.94,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nicotine Patches With Nicotine Inhaler","deltaMin":43.64,"sd":null},{"arm":"Varenicline With Bupropion","deltaMin":39.82,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":34},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37142273","34611902","24934962"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":109},"commonTop":["Vivid Dreams","Change in Taste","Insomnia","Thirst","Irritability"]}}
