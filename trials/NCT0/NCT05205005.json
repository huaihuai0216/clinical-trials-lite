Importantly, T2D is widespread in the Veteran population. This epidemic of T2D also contributes to the staggering rates of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. Lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, are recommended as first-line therapy for the management of T2D. Unfortunately, patients with T2D exhibit diminished vascular adaptations to exercise. The proposed project will test the overall hypothesis that degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx, a characteristic feature of T2D, precludes shear stress mechanotransduction and consequent exercise-induced vascular adaptations. As such, the investigators pose that restoration of the endothelial glycocalyx via dietary supplementation of glycocalyx precursors will potentiate vascular adaptations to exercise in Veterans with T2D.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Glygocalyx Integrity - Perfused Boundary Region","timeFrame":"Change from baseline to eight weeks assessment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dietary Supplementation of Glycocalyx Precursors (DSGP)","deltaMin":0.11,"sd":0.17},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.16,"sd":0.15}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Tendon injury","Loose stools","Stomach Ache","Headache","PT/PTT lab elevation"]}}
