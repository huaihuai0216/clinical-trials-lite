The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective AGN-190584 is in treating presbyopia compared to vehicle (placebo).\n\nAGN-190584 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of presbyopia. Participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to vehicle. Around 200 participants age 40-55 years with a diagnosis of presbyopia will be enrolled in the study in approximately 20 sites in the United States.\n\nParticipants will receive AGN-190584 or vehicle in each eye twice daily for 14 days.\n\nThere may be additional procedures for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a doctor's office. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, vision/eye tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Gaining 3 Lines or More in Mesopic, High-Contrast, Binocular Distance-Corrected Near Visual Acuity (DCNVA) With No More Than 5-Letter Loss in Mesopic Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (CDVA) With the Same Refractive Correction","timeFrame":"3 hours after second dose on Day 14","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vehicle","deltaMin":7.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"AGN-190584","deltaMin":35.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://rxabbvie.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":116},"commonTop":["HEADACHE","EYE IRRITATION"]}}
