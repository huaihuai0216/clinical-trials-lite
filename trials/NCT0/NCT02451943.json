Participants with Kaposi's sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) will be excluded. Note: Evidence of disease progression is required for participants that are not newly diagnosed.\n* Presence of measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1, Eisenhauer et al. 2009).\n* Performance status 0-1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.\n* The participant has not received any previous treatment with anthracyclines.\n* The participant may have had any number of prior systemic cytotoxic therapies for advanced/metastatic disease and are considered appropriate candidates for anthracycline therapy. All previous anticancer treatments must be completed ≥ 3 weeks (21 days) prior to first dose of study drug.\n* Availability of tumor tissue is required for study eligibility. The participant must have consented to provide archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue or be subject to a pre-treatment re-biopsy of primary or metastatic tumor tissue for future central pathology review and translational research (if archived tissue is unavailable).\n* Adequate hematologic, organ, and coagulation within 2 weeks (14 days) prior to randomization.\n* Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% assessed within 28 days prior to randomization.\n* Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization.\n* Females of child-bearing potential and males must agree to use highly effective contraceptive precautions during the trial and up to 3 months following the last dose of study drug.\n* The participant has, in the opinion of the investigator, a life expectancy of at least 3 months.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of GIST or Kaposi sarcoma.\n* Active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain metastasis) at the time of randomization. Participants with a history of a CNS metastasis previously treated with curative intent (for example, stereotactic radiation or surgery) that have not progressed on follow-up imaging, have been asymptomatic for at least 60 days and are not receiving systemic corticosteroids and or/anticonvulsants, are eligible. Participants with signs or symptoms of neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before randomization to rule out brain metastasis.\n* Prior treatment with doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and/or other anthracyclines or anthracenediones; the participant has received treatment with olaratumab or has participated in a prior olaratumab trial.\n* Prior radiotherapy of the mediastinal/pericardial area or whole pelvis radiation.\n* The participant has symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF \\< 50%), severe myocardial insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, or cardiomyopathy.\n* The participant has unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac stenting, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization.\n* The participant has a QT interval calculated using Bazett's formula (QTcB) interval of \\>450 milliseconds (msec) for males and \\>470 msec for females on screening electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n* Known allergy to any of the treatment components including a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biological composition similar to olaratumab.\n* The participant has a known active fungal, bacterial, or viral infection including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not required).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Survival (OS)","description":"Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.
