Monthly scores range from 0 (amenorrhea) to more than 500, with higher numbers indicating more bleeding.\n\nA slightly stained tampon/towel scores 1, a partially stained tampon/towel scores 5, a completely saturated tampon scores 10 and a completely saturated towel scores 20. Small clots/flooding (2cm) score 1. Large clots/flooding (3cm) score 5.\n\nMenorrhagia is defined as a PBAC \\> 100 during one menstrual period which approximates to a blood loss of \\> 80 mL. A PBAC of 400 corresponds to a blood loss of around 300 mL or approximately 80 tampons/towels used.\n\nThe week 13 PBAC score was calculated using the last 28 days of treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"92.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"18.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Co-primary Endpoint: Percent Change in Total Myoma Volume Assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) From Screening to End of Treatment Visit (Week 13 Visit)","description":"Percent change in total fibroid volume from screening to end of treatment visit (Week 13 visit) assessed by MRI and read centrally by a radiologist who was unaware of the study-group assignments.
