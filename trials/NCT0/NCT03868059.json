History of untreated obstructive sleep apnea or not compliant with sleep apnea treatment.\n15. Active alcohol or any drug substance abuse, or history of abuse that will interfere with the subject's ability to participate in the study in the judgement of the investigator.\n16. Use of known inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine) of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) within 30 days prior to study drug administration and through the end of the study. A list of prohibited medications is provided in Appendix C.\n17. Use of any investigational drug within 5 half-lives of the last dose in the past 6 months prior to Study Day -2 without principal investigator and/or sponsor approval.\n18. Receipt of any investigational drug by injection within 30 days or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration without principal investigator and/or sponsor approval.\n19. Subject who is not willing to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study.\n20. Any contraindications to a MRI scan (i.e. subjects with non-removable ferromagnetic implants, pacemakers, aneurysm clips or other foreign bodies), and/or subjects with claustrophobic symptoms and/or inability to fit into an MRI scanner.\n21. Inability to understand and provide written informed consent for the study.\n22. Considered by the investigator or the sponsor-designated physician, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable candidate to receive LPCN 1021 (exact reason should be specified by the investigator).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80
