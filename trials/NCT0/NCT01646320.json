If the mean of the originally scheduled central laboratory FPG and the repeat central laboratory FPG value is \\> 270 mg/dL, the subject cannot be randomized and must be discontinued.\n\n        * For subjects in Stratum B:\n      * At Week -2 a FPG qualification check will be performed. Subjects with a central laboratory FPG value meeting \\> 270 mg/dL will be scheduled for a follow-up visit (within 3 - 5 days) to obtain a second central laboratory FPG value.
