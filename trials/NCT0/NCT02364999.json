For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions except nodal disease (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: \\>= 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target lesions, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels and all lymph nodes must be normal in size; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"45.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events","description":"AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment.
