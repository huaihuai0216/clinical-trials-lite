Two tests that are considered to be gold standard tests for the diagnosis of GHD are the insulin tolerance test (ITT) and growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) combined with L-arginine (L-ARG). However, these tests are either bothersome (given intravenously) to the patient or are linked with side effects. Therefore, an orally available compound like AEZS-130 (formerly ARD-07), if demonstrated to be safe and providing adequate sensitivity and specificity could be a welcome alternative and/or complement to the current available tests.\n\nThe intent was to recruit 40 adult GHD (AGHD) patients and 40 healthy control subjects into this trial, but the original sponsor (Ardana Biosciences Ltd.) discontinued the study for financial reasons before this was completed. At the time of withdrawal of GHRH from the market in 2008, 42 AGHD patients and 10 normal controls had completed the study at 9 US sites. This study reactivated to complete the remaining 30 matched control subjects.\n\nAdditionally upon agreement with the FDA in a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), 10 additional adult growth hormone deficient and their matched control were planned to be enrolled into this trial for a total treated population of approximatively 100 subjects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis on Peak GH (Growth Hormon) Concentrations","timeFrame":"GH sampling: pre-dose and 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150 min post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cases/AEZS-130 Administered","deltaMin":2.36,"sd":5.69},{"arm":"Control/AEZS-130 Administered","deltaMin":17.71,"sd":19.11}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23559086"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":52},"commonTop":["Dysgeusia","Flushing","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Feeling hot"]}}
