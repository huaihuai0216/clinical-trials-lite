In addition, the response rate to each regimen, response duration, time to progression and time to treatment failure will be measured. Toxicity will be evaluated and compared between the two groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Up to 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Taxoprexin® and Carboplatin","deltaMin":8.31,"sd":null},{"arm":"Paclitaxel and Carboplatin","deltaMin":8.51,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":70,"n":256},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Alopecia","Constipation","Dyspenia"]}}
