However, if indicated, this should be confirmed by oestradiol and follicle stimulating hormone levels consistent with menopause (according to local laboratory ranges). Women who have not been confirmed as postmenopausal should be advised to use contraception.\n* Childbearing potential, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at Screening.\n* Is not pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has met any of the withdrawal criteria in the parent study (RTG114855) or has, in the opinion of the investigator, clinically significant abnormal laboratory or ECG findings that preclude entry into RTG114873.\n* Is planning to begin treatment with an investigational drug (other than retigabine) and/or an experimental device for the treatment of epilepsy or any other medical condition.\n* Has any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgement, is considered to be clinically significant and could potentially affect subject safety or study outcome, including but not limited to clinically significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic condition; or a condition that affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.\n* Is unwilling or unable to follow the study procedures or reporting of AEs.\n* Has active suicidal plan/intent or has had active suicidal thoughts in the past 6 months or has history of suicide attempt in the last 2 years or \\>1 lifetime suicide attempt.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent (TE) Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non-SAEs","description":"An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.

In this formula, innumerable seizures were counted as 10 seizures and status epilepticus was counted as 1 seizure. As this was an OLE study, Baseline was defined by the parent study Baseline period. The percent change from Baseline was calculated as the 28-day total POS on-treatment frequency (during dosing in this study, not including the taper phase) minus the Baseline 28-day total POS frequency, with this difference being divided by the Baseline 28-day partial seizure rate, and the resulting quantity multiplied by 100.
