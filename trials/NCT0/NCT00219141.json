An increase in LVMI indicates hypertrophy of the left ventricle. This could be a normal reversible response to cardiovascular conditioning (athletic heart) or an abnormal irreversible response to chronically increased volume load (preload) or increased pressure load (afterload). Thickening of the ventricular muscle results in increased left ventricular pressure, increased end-systolic volume, and decreased end-diastolic volume, causing an overall reduction in cardiac output.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.51","spread":"0.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.81","spread":"0.98"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-5.61","spread":"0.93"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change
