The toddlers were either meningococcal vaccine naïve or had received monovalent meningococcal C (MenC) vaccination during infancy to evaluate any potential impact of the meningococcal vaccine background on the immunogenicity and safety profile of the investigational product.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n* To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® in toddlers who either were meningococcal vaccine naïve or had received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy.\n* To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody response to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® in meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To compare the antibody responses (geometric mean titers \\[GMTs\\]) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA) in toddlers who either were meningococcal vaccine naïve or had received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy.\n* To compare the antibody responses (GMTs) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers.\n* To compare the antibody responses (GMTs) to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W after a dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Nimenrix® as measured by hSBA in toddlers who received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Antibody Titers Greater Than or Equal to (>=) 1:8 Against Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Toddlers Who Either Were Meningococcal Vaccine Naïve or Had Received Monovalent MenC Vaccination During Infancy","timeFrame":"Day 30 (post-vaccination)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine (Groups 1 and 3)","deltaMin":90.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nimenrix® (Groups 2 and 4)","deltaMin":91.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["Finland","Germany","Hungary","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.sanofipasteur.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":303},"commonTop":["Irritability","Injection Site Erythema","Injection Site Pain","Crying","Decreased Appetite"]}}
