This exception included monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines.\n* Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months.\n* For Groups 1 and 2 only: Vaccination against meningococcal disease with either a trial vaccine or a licensed meningococcal vaccine (i.e., polyvalent, polysaccharide, or Conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, Y, B; or any monovalent or bivalent meningococcal vaccine).\n* For Groups 3 and 4 only: Vaccination against meningococcal disease with either a trial vaccine or a licensed meningococcal vaccine (i.e., polyvalent, polysaccharide, or Conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, Y, B; or any monovalent B meningococcal vaccine), except licensed monovalent meningococcal C Conjugate (MenC) vaccination received during infancy.\n* Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).\n* History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically.\n* At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, participants with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or participants travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease).\n* Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances.\n* Personal history of an Arthus-like reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.\n* Personal history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome.\n* Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/legally acceptable representative contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Bleeding disorder or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion.\n* Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0°C). A prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided.\n* Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw - Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"23 Months","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Antibody Titers Greater Than or Equal to (>=) 1:8 Against Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, Y, and W in Toddlers Who Either Were Meningococcal Vaccine Naïve or Had Received Monovalent MenC Vaccination During Infancy","description":"Antibody titers against Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, Y, and W were measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (hSBA).
