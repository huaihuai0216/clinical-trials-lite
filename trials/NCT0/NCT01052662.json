A positive urine counted as 1, as did each self-reported day of use. Each participants total was divided by 8. Mean proportion by group were calculated by averaging the proportions across participants in that group.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":"0.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.27","spread":"0.10"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.39","spread":"0.14"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Treatment Retention","description":"Treatment retention during the stabilization period weeks 1 to 8 and after buprenorphine / naloxone discontinuation weeks 9 to 13.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Were Estimated to Have Survived as Assessed by Survival Curve of Relapse Rate After Achieving Complete Abstinence on Week 8","description":"Calculated survival curve from abstinence in Week 8 to first positive opioid urine screen or first reported relapse to opioid use to evaluate the effect of memantine on reducing early relapse and after rapid buprenorphine discontinuation on week 9.
