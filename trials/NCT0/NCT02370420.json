Patients will be divided into two groups. In both groups, they will be given verbal, clear and detailed information on the approach to follow, the intra-articular application of Platelet-Rich Plasma in the knee, plus rehabilitation exercises. In the first group will be held single application, while in the second group three applications will be made at an interval of two weeks each. Both groups will be assessed before and after application, together with outpatient follow-up by the SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Ostearthritis Index (Therapeutic Effect)","timeFrame":"Baseline,3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Unique Application of PRP","deltaMin":28.53,"sd":14},{"arm":"Triple Application of PRP","deltaMin":22.27,"sd":19.07}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18455690","24288804","20714903","14710506","21956670","19838676"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Pain, inflammation"]}}
