SF- 36v2™ questionnaire measured the HRQoL on 8 domains on individual scale ranges. The MCS measure is derived from domain scales of vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The scores 0-100 (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. A norm-based score of 50 corresponds to the mean score and 10 corresponds to the standard deviation of the 2009 U.S. general population. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline.

The DTSQs items are scored on a 7-point graded response scale ranging from 6 to 0. Higher scores indicate higher levels of treatment satisfaction for DTSQs items 1, 4 -8. For items 2 and 3 a higher score indicates a higher patient perceived experience of high blood sugars and low blood sugars, respectively. Thus, lower scores indicate a perception of blood glucose levels being \"none of the time\" unacceptably high (item 2) or low (item 3). The domain score of total treatment satisfaction (total treatment satisfaction score) was computed by adding the six items scores 1, 4-8. The score ranges 0-36.
