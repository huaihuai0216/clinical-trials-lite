Thus, improvement of the immune response to influenza vaccination in this age group, which is at higher risk for influenza-related morbidity and mortality, represents an important unmet need.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nImmunogenicity:\n\n* To demonstrate lot consistency of the Fluzone High Dose (Fluzone HD) manufacturing process through evaluation of the immune responses elicited by three different lots.\n* To demonstrate the superiority of Fluzone HD vaccine compared to standard-dose Fluzone® vaccine.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nImmunogenicity:\n\n* To describe the seroprotection of Fluzone HD compared to that of standard dose Fluzone® vaccine.\n\nSafety:\n\n* To describe the safety profile of Fluzone HD, in terms of solicited -, unsolicited adverse and serious adverse events post-vaccination.\n* To describe clinical information on some additional defined criteria during the six months following vaccination.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Hemagglutination Inhibition Antibody Titers Pre- and Post-vaccination With Fluzone® High Dose or Standard Fluzone® Vaccines.","timeFrame":"Day 0 and Day 28 Post-vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"High-Dose Inactivated, Split-Virion Influenza Vaccine Lot 1","deltaMin":28.25,"sd":null},{"arm":"High-Dose Inactivated, Split-Virion Influenza Vaccine Lot 2","deltaMin":29.41,"sd":null},{"arm":"High-Dose Inactivated, Split-Virion Influenza Vaccine Lot 3","deltaMin":27.86,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Comparator (Standard Fluzone®)","deltaMin":29.36,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19508159"],"seeAlso":["http://www.sanofipasteur.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":56,"n":855},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Myalgia","Malaise","Headache","Injection site erythema"]}}
