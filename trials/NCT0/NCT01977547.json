For patients with 1 organ dysfunction at randomization, New MODS is the development of at least 1 other concurrent organ dysfunction after randomization. Patients with MODS (ie concurrent dysfunction of ≥ 2 organ systems) at randomization can develop Progressive MODS defined as development of at least 1 additional concurrent organ dysfunction at during the 28 days after randomization. All deaths will be considered Progressive MODS. NPMODS will be monitored up to 28 days or ICU discharge because it is almost never observed beyond this time in children.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"147","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"133","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Organ Dysfunction","description":"Difference in number of organ dysfunctions.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"129","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"133","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"PELOD-2 Score","description":"Difference in PELOD-2 score.
