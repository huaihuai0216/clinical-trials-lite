It is desirable to understand the effect that this new emulsion has on tear film evaporation and tear lipid profile via interferometry, in patients with evaporative dry eye (EDE) and those without (non-EDE). It would also be valuable to evaluate the retention time of the lipid components of the new emulsion via tear collection and analysis in EDE and non-EDE patients","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tear Evaporation Rate","timeFrame":"Assessed at 4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Eye Drop 1","deltaMin":77.7,"sd":42.4},{"arm":"Eye Drop 2","deltaMin":67,"sd":31.7},{"arm":"Eye Drop 3","deltaMin":75.3,"sd":38}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Ocular irritation","Bacterial Chest Infection","Itchy and uncomfortable eyes","Burning and Stinging in the eye","Anemia and Vitamin D Deficiency"]}}
