Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. It is not yet known whether interferon alfa is more effective with or without combination chemotherapy and interleukin-2 for melanoma.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or without combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, plus interleukin-2, in treating patients who have melanoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"5-year Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Every three months for a year, every six months for years 2-5, annual for years 5-10","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Interferon","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Biochemotherapy","deltaMin":56,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.49"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":297,"countries":["United States","Australia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25332243"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":193},"commonTop":["Fatigue/malaise/lethargy","Nausea","Neutropenia/granulocytopenia","Vomiting","SGPT (ALT) increase"]}}
