The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels (1-5 denotes): no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems, respectively. A unique health state was defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each health state was converted into a single EQ-5D-5L index value. The index values are country specific and values specified for United Kingdom (UK) were used for this study. The index value range for UK lies between -0.594 - 1.000. A positive index value represents better health status while the negative value represents poor health status.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.14"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.14"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.15"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in EuroQol Group Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) Score","description":"The EQ VAS presents the participant's self-evaluated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.
