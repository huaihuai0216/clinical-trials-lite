Olanzapine administered 15 mg orally once daily (QD) was used as an active control. The primary hypothesis is that at least one of the asenapine doses is superior to placebo in improving schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the change from Baseline in the PANSS total score at Day 42. The first key secondary hypothesis is that at least one of the asenapine doses is superior to placebo in improving schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S) score at Day 42. The second key secondary hypothesis is that at least one of the asenapine doses is superior to placebo in improving schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the rate of PANSS responders (â‰¥30% Reduction From Baseline in PANSS Total Score) at Day 42.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Score at Day 42","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 42","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Asenapine 2.5 mg BID","deltaMin":-17.4,"sd":1.8},{"arm":"Asenapine 5 mg BID","deltaMin":-21.7,"sd":1.6},{"arm":"Olanzapine 15 mg QD","deltaMin":-21.6,"sd":2.32},{"arm":"Placebo BID","deltaMin":-16.2,"sd":1.71}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.6043"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.0356"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0587"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["27821210"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":97},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Anxiety","Headache","Somnolence","Schizophrenia"]}}
