Investigators hope to address the question of whether prenatal oral probiotic use, taken by healthy low risk GBS positive women from approximately 37 weeks gestation until the time of birth, will reduce the number of women who test positive for GBS at the time of admission to Labor and Delivery (L\\&D).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"GBS Culture Result (Positive Versus Negative)","timeFrame":"T2 (admission to Labor and Delivery; 36 - 42 weeks gestational age)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Probiotic Dietary Supplement","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40442923"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":34},"commonTop":[]}}
