Our proposal is to deploy a wearable solution that predicts physiological perturbation comparable to invasive devices and to perform continuous remote patient monitoring; this will be connected to a structured, cascading, escalation pathway involving home health nurses, advanced practitioner providers, specialists, and surgeons, and has the potential to transform care management in the post-discharge period, where patients are the most vulnerable for readmission.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Attrition Rate","timeFrame":"30 days from patient discharge date","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phase I: Soft Launch (120 Days)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Phase II: Calibration (210 Days)","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":[]}}
