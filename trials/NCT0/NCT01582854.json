Subjects received IV infusions whilst in hospital, and tablets once discharged. Subjects were followed up for a further six months after their treatment had been stopped to explore if the cognitive symptoms of the subjects treated with Actovegin showed sustained improvement. The trial also explored the possible prevention of dementia with Actovegin in patients who had suffered a recent ischaemic stroke, as well as the effect of Actovegin on other stroke outcomes. Safety information on Actovegin was collected.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale + Cognitive Subscale Extended Version (ADAS-cog+) at Month 6","timeFrame":"Baseline and Month 6","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Actovegin","deltaMin":-6.8,"sd":0.58},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-4.6,"sd":0.58}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.005"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["Belarus","Kazakhstan","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28432265"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":250},"commonTop":["Dementia","Headache","Respiratory tract infection viral","Dyslipidaemia","Atrial fibrillation"]}}
