Therefore, a negative change in ICARS score represents an improvement.

The neurological exam covers bulbar function, upper limb coordination, lower limb coordination, peripheral nervous system function, deep tendon reflexes, stability and gait. The use of FARS has been recently validated as a sensitive scale for this population. The FARS consists of three subscales, comprising a general score for ataxia, a score for activities of daily living (ADL) and a neurological examination. The scores can be added to make a total score ranging from 0 to 159. A higher score indicates a greater level of disability.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":"5.59"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Nature of Adverse Events","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"117","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"97","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"75","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Frequency/Number of Mild, Moderate, and Severe Adverse Events","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":68},"commonTop":["headache","upper respiratory tract infection","nausea","pyrexia"]}}}
