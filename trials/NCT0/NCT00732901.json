The IMT is a continuous performance test. Subjects were instructed to respond on the computer's left mouse button when a five-digit number the target stimulus appeared that was exactly like the preceding stimulus. A catch stimulus was a number that differed only slightly from the preceding number. Only one of the five digits was changed its position and value was determined randomly. Responses errors made to catch stimuli were considered commission errors or 'false alarms'. Immediate Memory Task Commission Errors to catch stimuli were the primary measure of impulsivity in this study. Scale is percentage of overall responses to a catch stimulus that were commission errors, ranging from 0 to 100. Zero would equate to no impulsivity and 100 would equate to 100% impulsive responses.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Attentional Bias as Measured by the Cocaine Stroop Task.","description":"Attentional bias is the difference in reaction time to cocaine related words and neutral words.
