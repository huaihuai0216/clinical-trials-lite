The primary hypothesis is that a switch to MK-8591A will be non-inferior to continued treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF as assessed by the proportion of participants with HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) ≥50 copies/mL at Week 48. Participants who benefit from their assigned intervention (as determined by investigator) will be able to continue treatment through a 24-week study extension.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Ribonucleic Acid (HIV-1 RNA) ≥50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DOR/ISL","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"BIC/FTC/TAF","deltaMin":0.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":89,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Canada","Finland","France","Germany","Italy","Japan","Puerto Rico","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38734016"],"seeAlso":["http://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":322},"commonTop":["Headache","COVID-19","Arthralgia","Back pain","Diarrhoea"]}}
