Darunavir has a potentially superior antiviral efficacy, a better tolerance and its single daily administration may facilitate treatment adherence.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Plasma HIV RNA < 50 Copies/mL","timeFrame":"48 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A","deltaMin":105,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B","deltaMin":92,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C","deltaMin":97,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["Burkina Faso","Cameroon","Senegal"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31273686"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":152},"commonTop":["Infectious gastroenteritis and colitis, unspecified","Symptoms and signs concerning food and fluid intake","Pruritus","Influenza, virus not identified","Acute bronchitis"]}}
