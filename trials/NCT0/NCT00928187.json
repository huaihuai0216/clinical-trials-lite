Documented HIV-1 infection regardless of clinical stage and CD4 lymphocyte count\n* Patient with treatment failure after first-line antiretroviral treatment with a combination including a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, failure being defined as 2 measurements (at 1 month interval) of plasma HIV RNA levels \\> 1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of uninterrupted treatment\n* Adherence (\\> 80%) to first- line antiretroviral treatment (questionnaire) at pre inclusion\n* Patient agrees not to take any concomitant medication during the trial without informing the investigator\n* Informed consent signed no later than D-15\n* For women in childbearing age: negative pregnancy test at inclusion, with no plan of pregnancy in the coming 12 months and agreeing to use mechanical contraception (with or without hormonal contraception) during the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Infection with HIV-2 or HIV-1 groups O or N or HIV1+2\n* Deficiency of the patient, making it difficult, if not impossible, for him/her to take part in the trial or understand the information provided to him/her\n* Participation in any other clinical trial\n* Presence of an uncontrolled, ongoing opportunistic infection or of any severe or progressive disease\n* First-line treatment with a protease inhibitor,
