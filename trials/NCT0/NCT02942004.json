Response choices include: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. The CGI-I was only rated at post-treatment assessments. By definition, all CGI-I assessments were evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI-I response was defined as having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"55.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"83.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"82.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"71.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"64.1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"80.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"72.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) Total Score","description":"The GAD-7 is a participant-rated, generalized anxiety symptom severity scale. Scoring for GAD-7 generalized anxiety is calculated by assigning scores of 0 = \"not at all sure,\" 1 = \"several days,\" 2 = \"over half the days,\" and 3 = \"nearly every day\" to the response categories. The GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21, where a score of 0 to 4 = minimal anxiety, 5 to 9 = mild anxiety, 10 to 14 = moderate anxiety, and 15 to 21 = severe anxiety. The GAD-7 total score was calculated as the sum of the seven individual item scores. A negative change from baseline indicates less anxiety. A positive change from baseline indicates more anxiety.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.95","spread":"1.012"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-8.08","spread":"1.095"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-7.99","spread":"1.087"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-6.57","spread":"0.947"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-9.13","spread":"1.025"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-6.32","spread":"1.034"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-8.60","spread":"1.081"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-9.20","spread":"1.210"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-8.71","spread":"1.191"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-8.47","spread":"1.093"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-8.53","spread":"1.224"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-9.22","spread":"1.199"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-7.70","spread":"1.023"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-9.72","spread":"1.129"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-9.15","spread":"1.135"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events","description":"An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
