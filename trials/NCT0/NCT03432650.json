There remains no definitive perioperative pain regimen that has been proven to be effective and safe for this ambulatory procedure. Some institutions perform peripheral nerve blocks either preoperatively or postoperatively as a rescue block. All of these PNBs lead to quadriceps weakness which may impede earlier mobilization and physical therapy. While some case reports exist, there have not been any studies evaluating the QLB for hip arthroscopy patients. As previously mentioned, the technique is easy to perform, well-tolerated by patients, and avoids side effects such as hypotension, urinary retention, or the quadriceps weakness associated with lumbar plexus blockade.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Numerical Pain Rating System (NRS) Pain Scores","timeFrame":"30min after Post Anesthesia Care Unite (PACU) arrival","effectByArm":[{"arm":"QLB Block + Standard of Care","deltaMin":3.3,"sd":3.4},{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":4.4,"sd":3.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":48},"commonTop":[]}}
