It is divided into three domains: role function-restrictive (questions 1-7, score range 7 to 42) assesses how migraines limit one's daily social and work-related activities; role function-preventive (questions 8-11, score ranges 4 to 24) assesses how migraines prevent these activities; and the emotional function (questions 12-14, score ranges 3 to 18) domain assesses the emotions associated with migraines. Participants respond to items using a 6-point scale where 1=none of the time and 6=all of the time. Raw dimension scores are computed as a sum of item responses and rescaled to a 0 to 100 scale, where higher scores from Baseline indicate better quality of life.
