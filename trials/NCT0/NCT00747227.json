Contrast sensitivity was measured in photopic and mesopic conditions at the following spatial frequencies: 3.0, 6.0, 12.0, and 18 cpd (cycles per degree). Contrast sensitivity is measured in log units. A higher value for the logarithmic units translates to better contrast sensitivity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.62","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.62","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.63","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.60","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.65","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.76","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.74","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.91","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.94","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.58","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.59","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.09","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.14","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity","description":"Snellen Equivalent of 20/40 or better at one year","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"110","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"116","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Subject Satisfaction - Subjects Satisfied With Overall Eyesight Rated as \"Good\" or \"Excellent\".","description":"Subjects indicating a subjective response to a multiple choice question, \"At the present time, would you say your eyesight using both eyes (with glasses or contact lenses, if you wear them) is excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor or are you completely blind?\", on a multi-item questionnaire administered by interviewer to determine subject satisfaction with their overall visual outcome at the one year visit.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"112","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"113","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":126},"commonTop":[]}}}
