This was a non-inferiority design with comparison of rate ratio of 18-month event rates of the Device and Control groups. The 18-month rate represents the probability of an event occurring within 18 months, and the 18-month rate ratio is a mean of the rate ratios. The primary endpoint was based on a calculation of the probability of events at 18 months but the statistical piecewise hazards model does not require the observation of any subjects out to 18-months.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.064","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.063","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Composite of Ischemic Stroke or Systemic Embolism","description":"Composite of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism excluding events that occurred in the first 7 days following randomization","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0253","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0200","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":86,"n":269},"commonTop":["Device thrombus","Epistaxis","Anemia requiring transfusion","Gastrointestinal bleeding","Hematuria"]}}}
