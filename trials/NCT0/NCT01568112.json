The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BG00012 when administered orally as a 240 mg BID dose regimen with and without 325 mg ASA premedication or following a slow-titration dosing schedule in healthy volunteers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Reporting Overall Flushing Events During the Overall Treatment Period, as Assessed by the Modified Flushing Severity Scale (MFSS)","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":41,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012","deltaMin":91,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012 + ASA","deltaMin":81,"sd":null},{"arm":"BG00012 Slow Titration","deltaMin":98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25999183"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":44},"commonTop":["Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Eosinophilia","Vomiting"]}}
