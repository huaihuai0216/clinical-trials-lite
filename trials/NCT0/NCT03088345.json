It is usually reported as dimensionless but is sometimes reported as normalized to dopamine mcg/kg/min equivalents. The score starts at 0 and has no defined upper limit, with a commonly observed range 0-50. It is used as a measure of the intensity of hemodynamic support, with higher scores indicating more vasoactive drug support for patients. The relationship of VIS to other patient outcomes is not consistent. It will be calculated hourly for all subjects and compared between groups over the entire observation timeframe.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":"1.6"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.3","spread":"1.9"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Hemodynamics as Characterized by Mean Arterial Pressure","description":"Organ perfusion pressure measured as Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
