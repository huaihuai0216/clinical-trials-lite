These patients should be monitored twice a month for HbsAg, HBCab, HBV-DNA).\n* Patients which have or have had another type of cancer exception made for skin cancers (melanoma and \"in situ\" cervical cancer not included).\n* Patient with a history of anaphylaxes or more generally patients which have had any serious allergic reaction after serum infusion.\n* Patient with uncontrolled epilepsy, CNS disorders or psychiatric problems which, according to the investigator, is likely to interfere with participation in this clinical study (i.e. the signing of the informed consent, therapy compliance).\n* Inability to attend follow-up visits.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Event Free Survival","description":"EFS was defined from the time of the study entry to any treatment failure including disease progression or discontinuation of treatment for any reason or date of the last follow-up visit","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"65","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"62","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Complete Remission","description":"Clinical response was assessed by complete restaging according to Cheson criteria.
