(\"\\>= 56 years\" means from the day of the 56th birthday onwards).\n* Able to attend all scheduled visits and to comply with all study procedures.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Pregnant, or lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using an effective method of contraception or abstinence from at least 4 weeks prior to vaccination and until at least 4 weeks after vaccination. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, a female must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or surgically sterile.\n* Participation in the 4 weeks preceding study enrollment/vaccination or planned participation during the active phase of the present study period in another clinical study investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure.\n\nNote: \"Active phase\" refers to the period of time from revaccination with MenACYW Conjugate vaccine to the end of the short-term (i.e., \\~30 days) follow-up after the vaccination. Accordingly, following the blood draw at Visit 1, participants in Group 3 and Group 4 will have a 2-year inactive phase prior to Visit 2. Prior to Visit 2, participants in Group 3 and Group 4 will have inclusion and exclusion criteria reassessed and will continue with or be excluded from further participation in the trial as appropriate.\n\n* Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks (28 days) preceding the study vaccination or planned receipt of any vaccine during the active phase of the present study except for influenza vaccination, which might be received at least 2 weeks before or after study vaccine. This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines.\n* Receipt or planned receipt of any meningococcal vaccine since receipt of a single dose of MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Menomune vaccine in Study MET49 or Study MET44.\n* Receipt of immune globulins, blood, or blood-derived products in the 3 months prior to either enrollment or MenACYW Conjugate vaccination in the current study.\n* Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months prior either to enrollment or MenACYW conjugate vaccination in the current study).\n* History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically.\n* At high risk for meningococcal infection during the study (specifically, but not limited to, participants with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or participants travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease).\n* Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccine used in the study or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances (excluding participants in Group 5 and Group 6).\n* Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating IM vaccination, in the Investigator's opinion (excluding participants in Group 5 and Group 6).\n* Personal history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) (excluding participants in Group 5 and Group 6).\n* Personal history of an Arthus-like reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine within at least 10 years of the proposed study vaccination (excluding participants in Group 5 and Group 6).\n* Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion (excluding participants in Group 5 and Group 6), contraindicating IM vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction.\n* Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, was at a stage where it might interfere with study conduct or completion.\n* Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature \\>= 100.4°F). A prospective participant should not be included in the study or receive study vaccination until the condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided.\n* Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw.\n* Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member (i.e., parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.\n\nThe above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"59 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Stage I: Percentage of Participants With Seroresponse for Meningococcal Serogroups A, C, W & Y Measured by Serum Bactericidal Assay Using Human Complement (hSBA) After Vaccination With MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine in Study MEQ00066: Group 1 (Menomune-primed)","description":"Antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y were measured by hSBA.
