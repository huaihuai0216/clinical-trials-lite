The proposed project is a pilot feasibility study of inpatient veterans with problem alcohol use at the William S. Middleton VA Hospital (Madison, WI). Participants will be randomized to one of two parallel study conditions: (1) an initial 50 mg oral dose of naltrexone prior to hospital discharge plus a 30-day prescription for oral naltrexone, or (2) a single 380 mg intramuscular injection of naltrexone administered prior to discharge and a second injection one month later. The central hypothesis is that hospital-administered injectable naltrexone, when compared to daily oral naltrexone taken at home, will reduce alcohol use in the days immediately following hospitalization. Injectable naltrexone has been efficacious vs. placebo in addition to behavioral treatment in several studies. However, it has yet to be examined in head-to-head comparison with oral naltrexone, or in the hospital setting as an intervention that might facilitate behavioral treatment follow up after discharge.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Retention Rate: Percentage of Participants Attended an Initial Behavioral Treatment Visit Within 2 Weeks of Hospital Discharge.","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Naltrexone","deltaMin":23,"sd":null},{"arm":"Injectable Naltrexone","deltaMin":22,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["depression"]}}
