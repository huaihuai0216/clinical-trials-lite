The WPAI-SpA has been validated in the rad-axSpA patient population. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism, percentage of presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score that combines absenteeism and presenteeism, and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. The computed percentage range for each sub-scale was from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.
