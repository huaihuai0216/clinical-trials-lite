The scale consists of 5 items: Time Spent, Interference, Distress, Resistance and Control. Each item is scored from 0 (None) to 4 (Extreme). The scale yields a Total Score from 0 (least symptomatic) to 20 (most symptomatic). Higher scores indicate greater severity of repetitive behavior.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.9","spread":"4.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"The Social Responsiveness Scale","description":"The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) is a 65-item parent completed scale that assesses social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation and autistic mannerisms. Each item is scored from 1 (not true) to 3 (almost always true). Interpretation in this study is based on a total score that is proportional to the level of impairment in reciprocal social behavior. Scores within 0-53 are within normal limits. Scores within 54-86 indicate mild to moderate impairment. Scores above 87 indicate severe impairment.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100.9","spread":"20.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) - Maladaptive Behavior Domain","description":"The VABS Maladaptive Behavior Domain measures undesirable behaviors that may interfere with an individual's adaptive functioning. The Maladaptive Domain consists two parts. Part I contains 27 minor maladaptive items and Part II contains 9 serious maladaptive behaviors. Each item is scored from 0 (never or seldom engages in the activity) to 2(usually or habitually engages in the activity). Part 1 yields a score of 0 to 54. Part II yields a score of 0 to 18. Both parts are combined to make a Total Score of 0 to 72.
