Cushing's Disease (that has recurred after primary pituitary surgery, or has failed pituitary surgery, or has been treated with radiation therapy to the pituitary, or is not treatable with surgery, or exists in patients who are not candidates for surgery, and is confirmed by documentation of ACTH immuno-reactivity on a pathological evaluation of pituitary tissue from a previous surgical specimen or IPSS with a central-to-peripheral gradient (ratio) of \\>2 before or \\>3 after CRH administration).\n  2.
