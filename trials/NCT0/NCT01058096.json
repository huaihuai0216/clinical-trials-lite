The 11-items are elevated mood, increased motor activity-energy, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, rate and amount of speech, language-thought disorder, content, disruptive-aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. The severity of the abnormality for 7-items are rated on a 5-point scale (0-4) and 4-items on a 9-point scale (0-8). The individual scores are summed for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 60 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.
