criteria :\n\n* Participants with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) treated with metformin at a stable dose ≥1500 milligrams per day (mg/day) or maximum tolerated dose (documented) for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening Visit; in case of documented lack of tolerance, metformin dose \\<1500 mg/day is acceptable, and the dose should be stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening Visit.\n* Participants has given written informed consent to participate in the study in accordance with local regulations.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Age \\<18 years at the Screening Visit or \\<legal age of majority, whichever is greater.\n* Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n* HbA1c, HbA1c \\<7.0% or HbA1c \\>10% at Screening.\n* Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) \\>15 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (\\>270 milligram per deciliter \\[mg/dL\\]) measured by the central laboratory at Screening (Visit 1) and confirmed by a repeat test (\\>15 mmol/L \\[\\>270 mg/dL\\]) before randomization.\n* Body mass index ≤20 or \\>45 kilogram per meter square (kg/m\\^2) at Screening.\n* Pregnant (confirmed by pregnancy test at the Screening) or breast-feeding women.\n* Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not willing to use highly effective method(s) of birth control during the study treatment period and the follow-up period, or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy (see Appendix A) during the study.\n* Previous use of any antidiabetic drug other than Metformin within 12 weeks preceding the Screening Visit.\n* Use of a selective Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (e.g., Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, or Empagliflozin) within 3 months prior to the Screening visit.\n* Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical, or ophthalmic application, intra-articular, nasal spray or inhaled forms) for more than 10 consecutive days within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Previous insulin use \\>1 month (at any time, except for treatment of gestational diabetes).\n* History of prior gastric surgical procedure, including gastric banding, or inflammatory bowel disease within 3 years prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Difficulty swallowing such that the participants cannot take the investigational medicinal product (IMP).\n* History of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Mean of 3 separate blood pressure measurements \\>180 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) (SBP) or \\>100 mmHg (DBP).\n* History of hypertensive emergency within 12 weeks prior to Screening.\n* Participants who have previously been randomized in any clinical trial of Sotagliflozin/LX4211.\n* Participants with severe renal disease as defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of \\<30 milliliter per minute per meter square (mL/min/1.73 m\\^2) at Screening, based on the 4 variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (or according to the renal function restrictions of metformin use defined in the local approved label).\n* Participants with severe anemia, severe cardiovascular (including congestive heart failure New York Heart Association IV), respiratory, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, or active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease that, according to Investigator, will preclude their safe participation in this study, or will make implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult.\n* Aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase: \\>3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (ULN).\n* Total bilirubin: \\>1.5 times ULN (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome).\n* Participants who have taken other investigational drugs within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives from Screening whichever is longer.\n* Participants unwilling or unable to perform self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG), complete the participant diary, or comply with study visits and other study procedures as required per protocol.\n* Participants with contraindication to glimepiride as per local labelling.\n* Participants with contraindication to metformin as per local labelling.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a Participants potential participation in a clinical trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
