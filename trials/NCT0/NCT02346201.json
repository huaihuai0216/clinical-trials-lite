ADMET 2 is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate as treatment for clinically significant apathy in AD participants. ADMET 2 will enroll participants from real world settings such as outpatient, nursing home, and assisted living facilities and will examine the effects of methylphenidate on apathy and cognition. ADMET 2 will also conduct careful safety monitoring.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)","timeFrame":"baseline to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methylphenidate","deltaMin":-4.5,"sd":4.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-3.1,"sd":3.6}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37066690","34570180","29347996"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":99},"commonTop":["Agitation","anxiety, nervousness, or tension","drowsiness","arthralgia","muscle stiffness or aching, muscle tenderness"]}}
