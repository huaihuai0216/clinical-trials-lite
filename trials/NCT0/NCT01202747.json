The screening methods include diagnostic expression of the meibomian glands and interferometry assessment of the tear film.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Association Between Screening Methods (Meibomian Gland Expression) and Treatment Effectiveness Outcomes (Total Meibomian Gland Score)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 4 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LipiFlow Treatment","deltaMin":0.4816,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.0005"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":[]}}
