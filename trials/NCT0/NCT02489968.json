Statistical analysis presented is based on a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach.

Observed cases analysis included only the available data that were observed while patients were on treatment, i.e., excluding the missing data.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.94","spread":"0.05"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.12","spread":"0.06"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.91","spread":"0.05"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.33","spread":"0.05"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":116},"commonTop":["Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Blood ketone body increased","Pollakiuria","Weight decreased","Constipation"]}}}
