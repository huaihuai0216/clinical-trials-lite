An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.01"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at Week 26","description":"The EQ-5D VAS records the participant's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated scale from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the worst imaginable health state and 100 indicating the best imaginable health state.
