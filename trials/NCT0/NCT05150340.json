This will help the study sponsor (Takeda) to work out the best dose to give people in the future.\n\nThe participants will be treated with TAK-771 for totally 27 or 30 weeks. Treatment period is consist of two periods called Epoch 1 and Epoch 2. In Epoch 1, different groups of participants will receive lower to higher doses of TAK-771 for 3 to 6 weeks. The study doctors will check for side effects from each dose of TAK-771. In Epoch 2, participants will receive TAK-771 once a 3 or 4 weeks until the end of 24 weeks.\n\nThere will be many clinic visits. The number of visits will depend on the infusion cycles of study drug (every 3, or 4 weeks).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Epoch 2: Serum Trough Levels of Total IgG Antibodies After Administration of TAK-771","timeFrame":"Up to Week 31 for Participants with 4-Week Dosing Interval or Up to Week 28 for Participants with 3-Week Dosing Interval","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Epoch 2: TAK-771 Full Dose Treatment Period","deltaMin":9.372,"sd":10.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/61b2391cf571d4002a64b47b"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":16},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Nasopharyngitis","Infusion site erythema","Injection site erythema","Injection site pain"]}}
