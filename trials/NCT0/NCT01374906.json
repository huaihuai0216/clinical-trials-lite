The Cushing's syndrome quality of life (CushingQoL) questionnaire is a single domain questionnaire which includes 12 self-report items scored using a five point Likert scale anchored at (1=always/very much and 5=never/not at all). The patient is asked to report what they think or feel about their Cushing's syndrome and how much the illness has interfered in usual activities over the past 4 weeks. The total score is standardized on a 0-100 scale with lower scores indicating a greater impact on quality of life.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.7","spread":"15.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.8","spread":"11.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.4","spread":"17.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.8","spread":"14.42"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.9","spread":"15.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.7","spread":"12.80"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.4","spread":"9.10"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.6","spread":"5.10"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Actual Change in SF-12v2 Score From Baseline - Mental Component Summary","description":"SF-12v2 General Health Survey is a general patient reported outcome instrument over time.

These eight domain scores can be combined to form two summary scores reflecting overall physical and mental health: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS).
