Because secondary functional MR usually develops as a result of LV dysfunction, guideline-directed medical therapy for HF forms the mainstay of therapy. However, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) fail to reverse adverse LV remodeling and functional MR, and the morbidity and mortality of patients with functional MR remain high despite standard medical therapy. Randomized trials to explore cardiovascular (CV) benefit of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor have been performed and showed a significant reduction on the risk of CV death or hospitalization for HF. However, its effect on cardiac structure and function was not evaluated and further mechanistic studies are needed to interpret beneficial clinical effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors. Based on studies demonstrating SGLT2 inhibitors' favorable effects on LV modeling, investigators hypothesize that SGLT2 inhibitor, ertugliflozin, is effective on improving MR in patients with functional MR secondary to LV dysfunction and try to examine this hypothesis in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized comparison study using echocardiography.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change of EROA","timeFrame":"Baseline and 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.03,"sd":0.12},{"arm":"Ertugliflozin","deltaMin":-0.05,"sd":0.06}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38690659"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":65},"commonTop":["Heart failure hospitalization"]}}
