The scale consists of 6 disease-specific questions, which individually will be rated on a 1-10 points scale, where a score of 1 represents the lowest satisfactory response with the treatment and 10 represents the highest satisfactory response. The questions are: Q1. How easy was the treatment to apply to the skin?; Q2. How greasy was the treatment when applying it to the skin?; Q3. How moisturized did your skin feel after apolying the treatment?; Q4. How greasy did your skin feel after applying the treatment?; Q5. How much did treating you skin disrupt your daily routine?; Q6. Overall, how satisfied were you with the medical treatment? The total PTCS score is calculated as the sum of the first 5 questions, ranging from 5 \\[low satisfaction\\] to 50 \\[high satisfaction\\].","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38.6","spread":"6.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36.1","spread":"7.0"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"36.2","spread":"7.6"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":213},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}}
