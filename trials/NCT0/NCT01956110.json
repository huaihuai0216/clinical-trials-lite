Both ovaries must be accessible for oocyte retrieval.\n* Early follicular phase (cycle day 2-4) serum levels of FSH between 1 and 15 IU/L (results obtained within 3 months prior to randomisation)\n* Body mass index (BMI) between 17.5 and 32.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at screening\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known endometriosis stage III-IV\n* One or more follicles ≥10 mm observed on the transvaginal ultrasound prior to randomisation on stimulation day 1\n* Known history of recurrent miscarriage (defined as three consecutive losses after ultrasound confirmation of pregnancy (excl. ectopic pregnancy) and before week 24 of pregnancy)\n* Known abnormal karyotype of subject or of her partner/sperm donor, as applicable, depending on source of sperm used for insemination in this trial.\n* Any known clinically significant systemic disease (e.g. insulin-dependent diabetes)\n* Any known endocrine or metabolic abnormalities (pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, liver or kidney) which can compromise participation in the trial with the exception of controlled thyroid function disease\n* Known tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, adrenal gland, pituitary or hypothalamus which would contraindicate the use of gonadotropins.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"40
