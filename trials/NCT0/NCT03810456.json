Veterans with anxiety-based disorders, including posttraumatic stress, panic, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety disorders (with or without co-occurring depression) will be randomized to an intensive CBT (iCBT) treatment delivered over one weekend, standard CBT (sCBT) delivered over 12 weeks or treatment as usual (TAU). The study will also evaluate the potential of the compressed weekend format of iCBT in producing more rapid improvement in outcomes and increasing psychotherapy engagement compared with a standard psychotherapy format. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with Veterans who receive iCBT and their family members to examine how iCBT and environmental factors impacted their process of recovery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"CRIS-EPS: Comparison of Extent of Participation Scores Among iCBT, sCBT, and TAU Groups From Baseline to 1, 3, and 6 Month Follow Ups","timeFrame":"Baseline, 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Month Follow Ups","effectByArm":[{"arm":"iCBT (Intensive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)","deltaMin":4.21,"sd":0.7},{"arm":"sCBT (Standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)","deltaMin":4.18,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"TAU (Treatment as Usual)","deltaMin":4.17,"sd":0.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":99},"commonTop":[]}}
