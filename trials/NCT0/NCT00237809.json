It uses 25 PANSS items organized into five scales: Negative, Positive, Dysphoric Mood, Activation, and Autistic Preoccupation. The PANSS is based on findings that schizophrenia comprises at least two distinct syndromes. The positive syndrome consists of productive symptoms, while the negative syndrome consists of deficit features. This distinction is useful when developing treatment plans because you can focus on the type of symptoms the patient is experiencing. It is also useful when studying the effects of medication (e.g., in clinical drug trials) because it allows you to determine which type of symptoms are being affected. PANSS Total score minimum = 30, maximum = 210. The greater the score, the greater the symptoms.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53.30","spread":"13.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"52.01","spread":"13.34"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"53.79","spread":"12.76"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"53.96","spread":"12.43"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale","description":"The Heinrichs-Carpenter Quality of Life Scale is a testing device.
