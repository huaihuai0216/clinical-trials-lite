For the 2 treatment groups being compared, ranking occurred within the comparison treatment groups combined (idursulfase weekly and placebo treatment groups). These comparison groups were pooled and ranked for each component separately. Within each component (% predicted FVC, 6MWT), the change from baseline was then ranked. The lowest change value was assigned a rank of 1, the next lowest a rank of 2, etc. The composite score for each participant was the sum of the 2 ranked scores corresponding to the 2 individual components (% predicted FVC and 6MWT) for each participant.
