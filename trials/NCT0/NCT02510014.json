Following a screening period, all subjects will receive run in SUBOXONE sublingual film followed by an initial injection of open-label high dose (300 mg) RBP-6000. The RBP-6000 monthly injection dose can be adjusted to low dose (100 mg), and back to high dose, based on the medical judgment of the Investigator. Subjects will participate in the study for either 6 or 12 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) During the Treatment Period","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Week 49 (De novo arm); Day 1 to Week 25 (Roll-over arm)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"De Novo Subjects","deltaMin":302,"sd":null},{"arm":"Roll-over Subjects","deltaMin":145,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":42,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37657559","35287034"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":412},"commonTop":["Constipation","Nausea","Injection site pain","Insomnia","Headache"]}}
