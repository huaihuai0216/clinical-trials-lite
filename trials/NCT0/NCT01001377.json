Each dimension contains 3 levels of response to reflect degree of problems participants have experienced: no problem (1), some problem (2) and extreme problems (3). The health states for each respondent are converted into a single index number using a specified set of weights. Resulting scores can range from 1.0 and -0.594. A higher score indicates a more preferred health status with 1.0 representing perfect health and 0 representing death. Negative scores are possible and represent health states regarded as less preferable than death (0).
