Prioritizing resources from a public health policy perspective could be easier if more precise estimates regarding the risks and benefits of other anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies were available, especially when the difference in costs could be billions of dollars over just a few years. Thus, there is a clear rationale at this time to explore potential anti-VEGF alternatives to ranibizumab that might prove to be as or more efficacious, might deliver equally lasting or longer-lasting treatment effects, and cost substantially less. Of the potentially available alternative anti-VEGF agents for this trial, bevacizumab and aflibercept are the best candidates for a direct comparison study. Bevacizumab shares the most similar molecular structure, costs far less, and is widely available. Furthermore, there is already preliminary evidence to suggest that it may be efficacious in the treatment of DME and it is already being widely used for this indication. Although aflibercept has a similar cost per unit dose to ranibizumab, it has the potential to decrease treatment burden and associated cost. If results from a comparative trial demonstrate improved efficacy or suggest similar efficacy of bevacizumab or aflibercept over ranibizumab, this information might give clinicians scientific rationale to substitute either one of these drugs for ranibizumab in the treatment of DME, and might thereby have substantial implications for public policy in terms of future estimates of health care dollars and possibly number of treatments necessary for anti-VEGF treatment of diabetic macular disease.\n\nBecause of its availability and lower cost, bevacizumab is already currently in widespread clinical use for treatment of DME despite the lack of FDA approval for this indication. Thus, a clinical trial that suggested whether bevacizumab could be used as a safe and efficacious alternative to ranibizumab could substantially impact nationwide practice patterns for treatment of DME by either validating the current use of bevacizumab or by demonstrating improved outcomes with ranibizumab or aflibercept treatment for DME.\n\nStudy Objective The primary objective of the proposed research is to compare the efficacy and safety of (1) intravitreal aflibercept, (2) intravitreal bevacizumab, and (3) intravitreal ranibizumab when given to treat central-involved DME in eyes with visual acuity of 20/32 to 20/320.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Change in Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Visual Acuity Letter Score From Baseline to 1-year","timeFrame":"Baseline to 1-year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aflibercept","deltaMin":13.3,"sd":11.1},{"arm":"Bevacizumab","deltaMin":9.7,"sd":10.1},{"arm":"Ranibizumab","deltaMin":11.2,"sd":9.4}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.034"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.12"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":90,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26605836","26935357","26087135","27711918","27280850","26222565","28152135","28448655","29392288","29625440","29525602","30077569","30676635","31246237","27993277","28219510","28335949","30318048","25692915","36774994","34934034","32722799"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":61,"n":224},"commonTop":["Vitreous floaters","Vision blurred","Conjunctival haemorrhage","Eye pain","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
