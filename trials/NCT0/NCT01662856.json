The 95% CI for the median TTH, on the other hand, was calculated based on the CI for the survival function S(t). The 95% CI for the median TTH was the set of all time points for which the 95% CI of the survival function contains 0.5 (since median is the 50% percentile). Sometimes, the confidence limits for the median cannot be estimated. In our case, the hemostasis was assessed on a discrete scale, and it happened that for all the time points assessed none of the 95% CI of the survival function S(t) contained 0.5.
