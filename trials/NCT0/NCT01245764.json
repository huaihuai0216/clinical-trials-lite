Data from the current study are needed in order to complement existing extensive safety data from the GARDASIL™ clinical trials program, and confirm that GARDASIL™ may be administered safely and will induce immune responses in populations from and living in Sub-Saharan Africa, as GARDASIL™ has not previously been studied in this region of the world.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Seroconvert to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6","timeFrame":"Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GARDASIL 9 to 26 Years Old","deltaMin":147,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo 9 to 12 Years Old","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25912475"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":79},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Headache","Injection site swelling","Pyrexia","Injection site erythema"]}}
