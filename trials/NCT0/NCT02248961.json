For women of child-bearing potential: negative urine pregnancy test at screening (Day -14). 8. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (when seated) at Randomization (Day 0) ≥140 mmHg and ≤179 mmHg.\n\n9\\. For women of child-bearing potential: negative urine pregnancy test at Randomization (Day 0)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Grade III Arterial Hypertension.\n2. Arterial hypotension (SPB ≤100 mm Hg) at Screening (Day -14) and/or Randomization (Day 0).\n3. Subjects needing treatment with more than one anti-hypertensive drug (more than one active substance, including complex drugs).\n4. Secondary (symptomatic) arterial hypertension.\n5. Known bilateral renal arterial stenosis or unilateral renal arterial stenosis.\n6. Hyperpotassemia \\>5,0 mmol/l (as per blood biochemistry results at Screening).\n7. Primary hyperaldosteronism.\n8. Known hypersensitivity to angiotensin-II receptors antagonists or any other study drug or comparator component.\n9. Contraindications for use of angiotensin-II receptors antagonists.\n10. Myocardial infarction and or unstable angina, and/or acute cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack, and/or percutaneous coronary intervention, and/or coronary arterial bypass graft, acute coronary arteries involvement, and/or obliterative vascular atherosclerosis of low extremities, and/or grade III and IV retinopathy in anamnesis.\n11. Clinically significant cardiac valves damage.\n12. Cardiomyopathies\n13. Chronic Heart failure (CHF) (except for CHF FC I NYHA).\n14. Creatinine clearance less than 60 ml/min/1.73m2 calculated by Cockroft-Gault formula.\n15. Known moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency and/or transaminase increase: AST and/or ALT ≥2\\*ULN.\n16. History of infections (HIV, hepatitis B or C, syphilis).\n17. Uncontrolled Diabetes mellitus, Glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) \\>7%.\n18. Severe systemic diseases, such as gastro-intestinal tract diseases, autoimmune disorders, blood disorders and other conditions which may affect on the study drugs' absorption, distribution and and excretion.\n19. Clinically significant abnormalities of laboratory parameters.\n20. Drug or alcohol addiction, psychiatric disorders.\n21. Medical history of oncological disease within 5 years before screening.\n22. Subjects with biliary tracts obstruction.\n23. Subjects with genetic disorders, such as galactose intolerance, congenital lactase insufficiency and glucose-galaclose malabsorption syndrome.\n24.
