Every attempt was made to use the same assessor for each subject throughout the study. n subjects with PsO, durability of response (maintenance of a PASI-50 response or greater at each assessment) was based on scoring the PsO lesions on a scale of 0 to 4 for 3 characteristics: erythema, induration, and desquamation, and within 4 anatomical regions: head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Within each of these regions, the area of involvement was scored on a scale of 0 to 6, with the total score being a weighted average, and weights defined by the area of involvement. The clinician assessed the subject's PsO lesions according to the PASI and provided this score within the case report form at Weeks 0 (as the Week 48 assessment of the parent study), 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Subjects were classified as having a PASI-50 response based upon 50% reduction from baseline of the parent study.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Disease Activity Score Using 28 Tender and Swollen Joint Counts, High Sensitivity C-reactive Protein, and Subject's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (DAS28-CRP[4]) <3.2 (ie, Low Disease Activity) at All Visits for All Subjects With RA.","description":"The DAS28-CRP(4) is a composite score (ranging from 0 to 9.4) calculated using the results of the TJC (using a 28 joint subset), SJC (using a 28 joint subset), hs-CRP level (mg/L), and SGA (0 to 100 scale).
