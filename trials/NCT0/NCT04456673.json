Treatment-boosted response is defined as an ADA positive response in the assay post first dose that is greater-than or equal to 4-fold over baseline titer levels, when baseline results are positive.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"47","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":79,"n":464},"commonTop":["Covid-19","Headache","Accidental Overdose","Nasopharyngitis"]}}}
