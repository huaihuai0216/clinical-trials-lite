This project will lead to better communication between physicians and could decrease medication errors that tend to occur as the patient goes from hospital to home.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Medication Errors at Hospital Discharge","timeFrame":"Approximately 1-30 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"(Usual) MedTrak System of PCP Notification","deltaMin":645,"sd":null},{"arm":"Automated Communication Tools","deltaMin":359,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17219528","17935242","17327525","12657079","15725981"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":317},"commonTop":[]}}
