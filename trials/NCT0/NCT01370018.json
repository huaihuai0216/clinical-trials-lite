Adult patients with this condition eventually develop emphysema. Most HIV-1 patients who have low viral load also have alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency. The number of CD4 cells in blood increases when alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor increases. Patients will be asked to participate in a pilot study to see whether the use of ZemairaÂ® (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor) can increase blood levels of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor and consequently increase CD4 counts.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"CD4/CD8 Ratio","timeFrame":"9 weeks after initiation of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor in HIV","deltaMin":0.44,"sd":0.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24229737","31824943"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":4},"commonTop":[]}}
