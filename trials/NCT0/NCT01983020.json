If one or more of the approaches is confirmed as efficacious and safe, it could have a significant impact on the routine management of postoperative pain in this context.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Intensity","timeFrame":"postoperative day 1 - 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ketamine","deltaMin":6.29,"sd":2.42},{"arm":"Lidocaine","deltaMin":5.76,"sd":2.25},{"arm":"Ketamine and Lidocaine","deltaMin":5.51,"sd":2.6},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.4,"sd":2.59}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":12},"commonTop":["Nausea","Sedation","Anxiety","Confusion","Blurred Vision"]}}
