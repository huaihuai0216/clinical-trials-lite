The study hypothesis is that measurement of the MBT will allow earlier detection of a decline in liver function in patients with cirrhosis who are awaiting liver transplantation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mortality From Liver Failure","timeFrame":"1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Laboratory Assay","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States","Israel"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15679768"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":107,"n":165},"commonTop":["Assorted Pains (excluding abdominal)","Out-patient procedure-Paracentesis","Diarrhea","Headaches, Migraines, Dizziness","Others"]}}
