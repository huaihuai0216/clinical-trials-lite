Participants were randomized to receive rituximab 500 mg intravenously (iv), rituximab 1000 mg iv, or placebo iv on days 1 and 15 every 24 weeks in the main study; all participants received concomitant methotrexate at a stable dose of 12.5-25 mg/week throughout the study. Further courses of rituximab were provided to eligible participants. Structural joint damage was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and at intervals during the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Erosion Score From Baseline to Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab 500 mg","deltaMin":0.13,"sd":2.258},{"arm":"Rituximab 1000 mg","deltaMin":0.39,"sd":1.807},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.33,"sd":2.235}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":60,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","Estonia","France","Germany","Greece","Latvia","Lithuania","Netherlands","Norway","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Switzerland","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25355728"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":62},"commonTop":["Bronchitis","Rheumatoid arthritis","Viral infection","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
