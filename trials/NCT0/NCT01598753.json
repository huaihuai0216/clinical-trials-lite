Others will receive an inactive pill, called a placebo. There will also be 2 different types of behavioral health treatments, Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Health Education (HE) both of which have been recommended for the treatment of patients with FM by the American Pain Society.\n\nThere are 4 possible study treatment combinations:\n\n1. Tramadol + CBT,\n2. Tramadol + HE,\n3. Placebo + CBT,\n4. Placebo + HE.\n\nAlthough Tramadol, CBT, and HE have been shown to have some benefits for FM patients, there have been no studies that have evaluated the combination of medication and a behavioral health treatment. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of the 4 combinations listed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a 30% Improvement in Pain or 20% Improvement in Function","timeFrame":"Baseline (one week prior to drug titration) to post-treatment (approximately 11 weeks after baseline).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo and Health Education","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tramadol and Health Education","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tramadol and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":37},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Constipation","Diarrhea","Dizziness"]}}
