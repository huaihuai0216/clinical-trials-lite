The SANDE is comprised of two questions, and each question employs a 100-mm horizontal linear VAS. The measurement of symptom frequency ranges from \"rarely\" to \"all of the time\", and the symptom severity from \"very mild\" to \"very severe\". Data collected from the SANDE questionnaire was calculated by multiplying the frequency score by the severity score and obtaining the square root.
