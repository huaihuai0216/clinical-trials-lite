Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Five Year Event-free Survival (EFS)","timeFrame":"Up to five years after enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Stratum 1","deltaMin":0.86,"sd":null},{"arm":"Stratum 2","deltaMin":0.53,"sd":null},{"arm":"Stratum 3","deltaMin":0.51,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.44"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.40"},{"comp":"OG002","p":"0.00000853"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Australia","Brazil","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34675114"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":39},"commonTop":["Anemia","Platelet count decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Febrile neutropenia","White blood cell decreased"]}}
