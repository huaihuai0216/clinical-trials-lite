Each participant was given a diary having questions related to participant's ability to remove the cap, to start the injection, to complete the injection and regarding confirmation of completing the injection. Participants were asked to answer the questions each time they self-inject the sarilumab. If the response was \"no\" to any of the first 3 questions, this was considered as a PTC. The used AID, for which PTC was reported, was sent to sponsor, examined and evaluated for the occurrence of a PTF.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Area Under the Serum Concentration Versus Time Curve Calculated Using the Trapezoidal Method During a Dose Interval (AUC[0-tau]) for Sarilumab","description":"AUC(0-tau) is defined as area under the serum concentration versus time curve calculated using the trapezoidal method during a dose interval, where dose interval was 2 weeks.
