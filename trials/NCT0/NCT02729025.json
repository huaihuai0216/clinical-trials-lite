Arterial 18F-FDG uptake is correlated with arterial macrophage content and predicts cardiovascular events. Images were analyzed by an experienced radiologist blinded to all patient characteristics.\n\nThe maximum standardized uptake value was calculated as a time- and dose- corrected tissue radioactivity divided by body weight in the index and the target-to-background ratio (TBR) was calculated from the ratio of the standardized uptake value of the artery compared to mean background venous activity. The average maximum TBR for the most diseased segment (MDS) was calculated from a group of 3 contiguous slices (approximately 1.5 cm), centered on the slice with the highest maximum TBR in the index vessel. The index vessel was defined as the vessel (either the right or left carotid or aorta) with the highest mean TBR at baseline.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.31","spread":"1.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-8.31","spread":"1.67"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in Lipoprotein(a) Concentration at Week 16","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.06","spread":"1.94"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-12.83","spread":"1.92"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Concentration at Week 16","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.64","spread":"1.86"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-59.02","spread":"1.82"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in Apolipoprotein B Concentration at Week 16","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.29","spread":"1.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-48.30","spread":"1.51"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":64},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Influenza","Influenza like illness","Diarrhoea"]}}}
