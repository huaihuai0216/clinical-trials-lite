TEAEs were summarized using MedDRA (Version 11.1) by SOC and PT. Participants reporting more than 1 AE for a given MedDRA PT were counted only once for that term. Participants reporting more than 1 AE within a SOC were counted only once for the SOC total. Based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), AEs were graded as grade 1=mild; grade 2=moderate: grade 3 = severe or medically significant, grade 4 = life threatening, grade 5 = death related to AE.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"114","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"112","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"72","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"74","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"18","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":170},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Blood creatine phosphokinase increased","Hepatic function abnormal","Pharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}}
