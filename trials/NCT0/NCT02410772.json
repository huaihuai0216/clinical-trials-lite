All three regimens are administered daily, seven days each week, with direct observation of each dose by a health-care worker at least five of the seven days of each week.\n\nThe standard six-month regimen is two months of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide followed by four months of isoniazid and rifampin.\n\nThe first short regimen is a single substitution of rifapentine for rifampin: two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, followed by two months of isoniazid and rifapentine.\n\nThe second short regimen is a double substitution of rifapentine for rifampin and moxifloxacin for ethambutol: two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, moxifloxacin, and pyrazinamide, followed by two months of isoniazid, rifapentine, and moxifloxacin.\n\nTarget enrollment is 2500 participants. Each study participant will remain in the study for 18 months in order to include at least 12 months of evaluation of whether the participant's TB recurs.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"TB Disease-free Survival at 12M After Study Treatment Assignment Among Participants in Control Regimen, Regimen1 (2HRZE/4HR) to Experimental Regimens, Regimen3 (2HPZM/2HPM) and Regimen2 (2HPZ/2HP) (Modified Intent to Treat [MITT] Population)","timeFrame":"Twelve months after treatment assignment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regimen 1 (2HRZE/4HR)","deltaMin":656,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen 2 (2HPZ/2HP)","deltaMin":645,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen 3 (2HPMZ/2HPM)","deltaMin":668,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.05"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":33,"countries":["United States","Brazil","China","Haiti","India","Kenya","Malawi","Peru","South Africa","Thailand","Uganda","Vietnam","Zimbabwe"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39477924","39012226","38462673","36790881","36041016","34918028","33951360","33794353","33713841","31981713"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":56,"n":825},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Hepatitis"]}}
