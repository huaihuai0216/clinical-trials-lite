Patients will receive either infliximab (a drug used to treat autoimmune diseases) or azathioprine (an immunosuppressant or drug used to suppress the immune system) or a combination of both for up to 34 weeks. This research study will involve approximately 500 patients. The main study involves up to 34 weeks (approximately 8 months). A study extension of an additional 20 weeks (approximately 5 months) is optional for patients who successfully complete the main study. A country-specific study extension of open label infliximab treatment for an additional 1 year is optional for patients who successfully complete the main study extension.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Corticosteriod-free Clinical Remission","timeFrame":"Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Azathioprine + Placebo","deltaMin":30,"sd":null},{"arm":"Infliximab + Placebo","deltaMin":44.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Infliximab + Azathioprine","deltaMin":56.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.006"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.022"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":115,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Israel","Netherlands","Norway","Portugal","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20393175","34216825","30267864","25728587","25245629","23974954","23954314"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":39,"n":161},"commonTop":["Nausea","Abdominal Pain","Fatigue","Arthralgia","Headache"]}}
