However, there is increasing evidence that this hormone might help support the body's ability to produce insulin when diabetes develops. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of endogenous GLP-1 secretion on insulin secretion in people with and without type 2 diabetes.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Fasting Glucagon in the Presence or Absence of Exendin-9,39","timeFrame":"Average concentration over the -30 to 0 minutes of study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"No Diabetes","deltaMin":7.4,"sd":1.2},{"arm":"Type 2 Diabetes","deltaMin":7.9,"sd":0.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37751301"],"seeAlso":["https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Hyperglycemia","IV access loss"]}}
