A HIS value greater than 0.14 would mean that the subject is likely to be cirrhotic (based on biopsy result as the gold standard). The HIS is a probability score,i.e. ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 would mean the lowest probability of having liver cirrhosis and 1 would be the highest probability of having liver cirrhosis.
