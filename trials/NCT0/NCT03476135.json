This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines. If the participant was due to receive vaccination(s) recommended for his/her age by the national immunization schedule at the time of the study, the participant was recommended to complete his/her immunization schedule after Visit 2.\n* Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine (i.e., mono- or polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, Y, or W; or meningococcal B vaccine) with the exception of the single dose of meningococcal vaccine administered as part of study MET54.\n* Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months.\n* Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).\n* History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically\n* At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, participants with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or participants traveling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease).\n* Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccine used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances.\n* Verbal report of thrombocytopenia, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination.\n* Personal history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Personal history of an Arthus-like reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.\n* Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, was at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion.\n* Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature \\>= 38.0 degree Celsius \\[°C\\]). A prospective participant was not included in the study until the condition had resolved or the febrile event had subsided.\n* Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw.\n* Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"46
