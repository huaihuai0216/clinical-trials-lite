Postmenopausal female subjects between the ages of 40 and 75 years (at the time of randomization) with at least:\n\n   * 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (women \\<55 years of age with a history of hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy prior to natural menopause must have follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels \\> 40 mIU/mL), OR\n   * 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels \\> 40mlU/mL OR\n   * At least 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy.\n2. ≤5% superficial cells on vaginal cytological smear\n3. Vaginal pH \\> 5.0\n4. Moderate to severe symptom of vaginal pain associated with sexual activity considered the most bothersome vaginal symptom by the subject at screening visit 1A.\n5. Moderate to severe symptom of vaginal pain associated with sexual activity at screening visit 1B.\n6. Onset of moderate to severe dyspareunia in the postmenopausal years.\n7. Subjects should be sexually active (i.e. have sexual activity with vaginal penetration within approximately 1 month of screening visit 1A).\n8. Subjects should anticipate having sexual activity (with vaginal penetration) during the conduct of the trial.\n9. For subjects with an intact uterus: Subjects must have an acceptable result from an evaluable screening endometrial biopsy.\n10. Subjects who have a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 38 kg/m2. BMI values should be rounded to the nearest integer (ex. 32.4 rounds down to 32, while 26.5 rounds up to 27).\n11. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject will comply with the protocol and has a high probability of completing the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Use of the following:\n\n   1. Oral estrogen-, progestin-, androgen-, or SERM-containing drug products within 8 weeks before screening visit 1A (can enter washout);\n   2. Use of transdermal hormone products within 4 weeks before screening visit 1A (can enter washout);\n   3. Use of vaginal hormone products (rings, creams, gels) within 4 weeks before screening visit1A (can enter washout);\n   4.

Unresolved findings suspicious for malignancy on the breast exam; incomplete mammogram result (BI-RADS 0) or unresolved findings suggestive of malignant changes or findings requiring short interval follow-up on the prestudy mammogram (subjects must have mammography result of BI-RADS 1 or 2 to enroll.) Mammogram may be performed within 9 months prior to Visit 2 (randomization) with documentation available. (The site must obtain a copy of the official report for the subject's study file, and it must be verified that the mammogram itself is available if needed for additional assessment);\n   3. In subjects with intact uterus: have a screening endometrial biopsy sample that is found by both primary pathologists to have endometrial tissue insufficient for diagnosis, no endometrium identified, or no tissue identified. (With the approval of the Medical Monitor, the screening endometrial biopsy may be repeated once);\n   4. In subjects with intact uterus: an endometrial biopsy report by one central pathologist at screening with one of the following:\n\n      * Endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer, proliferative endometrium, weakly proliferative endometrium, disordered proliferative pattern; OR\n      * Endometrial polyps with hyperplasia, glandular atypia of any degree (e.g., atypical nuclei) or cancer;\n   5.
