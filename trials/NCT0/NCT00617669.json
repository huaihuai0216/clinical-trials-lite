This trial will look at the effects of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) in hormone resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases compared with docetaxel.\n\nAll patients participating in this clinical trial will receive docetaxel chemotherapy, which is a commonly used chemotherapy to treat prostate cancer in addition to other existing prostate cancer therapies.\n\nHalf the patients will receive ZD4054 (Zibotentan), and half the patients will receive placebo in addition to docetaxel and other prostate cancer therapy. By participating in this trial there is a 50% chance that patients will receive an agent that may further slow the progression of the tumour.\n\nNo patients will be deprived of standard prostate cancer therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"Patients were followed for survival up to 40 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ZD4054 + Docetaxel","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Docetaxel","deltaMin":19.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":147,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","India","Italy","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Serbia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23569308"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":214,"n":522},"commonTop":["Oedema Peripheral","Alopecia","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue"]}}
