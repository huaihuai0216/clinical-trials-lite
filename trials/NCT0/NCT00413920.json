Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either EC-MPS or steroids in combination with EC-MPS. Patients of both treatment groups will receive monoclonal antibody induction therapy and a perioperative bolus of steroids and cyclosporine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With the Occurrence of Treatment Failures at 6 Months Post-transplantation","timeFrame":"6 months post transplantation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Without Steroids","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"With Steroids","deltaMin":16,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":72,"n":112},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Urinary tract infection","Hyperglycaemia","Oedema peripheral","Insomnia"]}}
