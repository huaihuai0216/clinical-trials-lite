Criteria:\n\n* A diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the index hip or knee based on American College of Rheumatology criteria with Kellgren Lawrence x-ray Grade of at least 2 as diagnosed by the Central Reader\n* A history of insufficient pain relief from acetaminophen along with a history of insufficient pain relief from, inability to tolerate or contraindication to taking NSAIDs, and tramadol or opioid treatments.\n* WOMAC Pain subscale score of at least 5 in the index hip or knee at Screening.\n* Be willing to discontinue all non study pain medications for osteoarthritis and not use prohibited pain medications throughout the duration of the study.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to comply with protocol specified contraceptive requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects exceeding protocol defined BMI or body weight limits.\n* History of other diseases specified in the protocol (e.g. inflammatory joint diseases, crystalline diseases such as gout or pseudogout) that may involve the index joint and that could interfere with efficacy assessments.\n* Radiographic evidence of protocol specified bone or joint conditions in any screening radiograph as determined by the central radiology reviewer.\n* A history of osteonecrosis or osteoporotic fracture.\n* History of significant trauma or surgery to a knee, hip or shoulder within the previous year.\n* Planned surgical procedure during the duration of the study.\n* Presence of conditions (e.g. fibromyalgia, radiculopathy) associated with moderate to severe pain that may confound assessments or self evaluation of osteoarthritis pain.\n* Signs or symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in the year prior to Screening.\n* Considered unfit for surgery based upon American Society of Anesthesiologists physical classification system for surgery grading, or subjects who would not be willing to undergo joint replacement surgery if required.\n* History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to acetaminophen or any of its excipients or existence of a medical condition or use of concomitant medication for which the use of acetaminophen is contraindicated.\n* Use of prohibited medications without the appropriate washout period prior to Screening or Initial Pain Assessment Period.\n* History of cancer within 5 years of Screening, except for cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell cancer resolved by excision.\n* Subjects with signs and symptoms of clinically significant cardiac disease as described in the protocol.\n* Diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack in the 6 months prior to Screening, diagnosis of stroke with residual deficits that would preclude completion of required study activities.\n* History, diagnosis, or signs and symptoms of clinically significant neurological disease such as but not limited to peripheral or autonomic neuropathy.\n* History, diagnosis, signs or symptoms of any clinically significant psychiatric disorder.\n* History of known alcohol, analgesic or drug abuse within 2 years of Screening.\n* Previous exposure to exogenous NGF or to an anti-NGF antibody.\n* History of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a therapeutic or diagnostic monoclonal antibody or IgG fusion protein.\n* Poorly controlled hypertension as defined in the protocol or taking an antihypertensive that has not been stable for at least 1 month prior to Screening.\n* Evidence of protocol defined orthostatic hypotension at Screening.\n* Disqualifying score on the Survey of Autonomic Symptoms questionnaire at Screening.\n* Screening AST, ALT, serum creatinine or HbA1c values that exceed protocol defined limits.\n* Presence of drugs of abuse in screening urine toxicology panel.\n* Positive hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV test results indicative of current infection.\n* Participation in other investigational drug studies within protocol defined time limits.\n* Pregnant, breastfeeding or female subjects of childbearing potential who
