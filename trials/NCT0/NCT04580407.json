Acquired hemophilia A is when people's immune system attacks specific proteins, known as clotting factors, in their bodies. This is different from hemophilia A, which is a condition people are born with.\n\nAt the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. For those who can take part, participants will visit the clinic or hospital when they get their next bleed. They will receive TAK-672 slowly through a vein. This is called an infusion. They might need extra infusions of TAK-672 to control the bleed. After their bleed is controlled, participants will regularly visit the clinic for a check-up and to treat any further bleeds. This will happen until all participants have received their last dose of TAK-672 to control their 1st bleed. After this, all participants will visit the clinic 90 days later for a final check-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Severe Bleeding Episodes Who Demonstrated Response to TAK-672 Therapy at 24 Hours After the Initiation of Treatment","timeFrame":"24 hours after the initial dose of TAK-672","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TAK-672","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/5f9464b2296beb001e63bf9f"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":5},"commonTop":["Haemorrhage subcutaneous","Anal fissure","Apnoea","Arthralgia","Blood urine present"]}}
