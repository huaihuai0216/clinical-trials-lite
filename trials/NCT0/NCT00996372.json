The scale consists of 19 items that assess sexual function over the past four weeks and yields scores in six domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The two items in the desire domain are scored from 1 to 5 (with 1 being the lowest report of desire and 5 being the highest). The raw scores of the two items are added together and then multiplied by the domain factor of 0.6. Thus, the score of the desire domain ranges from 1.2 to 6.0 (the higher the score, the higher the reported level of desire).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7","spread":"0.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.4","spread":"0.1"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline on Question 13 of the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised (FSDS R)","description":"The FSDS© is a self-administered measure of female personal distress associated with sexual dysfunction.
