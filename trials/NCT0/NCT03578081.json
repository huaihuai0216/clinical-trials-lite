Olanzapine and fosaprepitant dimeglumine may help control nausea and vomiting in patients during chemotherapy. Olanzapine is usually given in combination with other drugs, including fosaprepitant dimeglumine. It is not yet known if olanzapine when given with other drugs, is still effective without using fosaprepitant dimeglumine for controlling nausea and vomiting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"No Nausea Rate Defined as a Response of 0 in the Nausea Item of Nausea and Vomiting Daily Diary/Questionnaire in the Overall (0-120 Hours), Acute (0-24 Hours), and Delayed (24-120 Hours) Periods","timeFrame":"Up to 120 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Fosaprepitant Dimeglumine, Olanzapine)","deltaMin":123,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Placebo, Olanzapine)","deltaMin":97,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":20,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":566,"countries":["United States","Guam"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37284847"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":51,"n":286},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Neutrophil count decreased","Lymphocyte count decreased","Alopecia","Anemia"]}}
