An acute VVC episode during the maintenance phase (considered a recurrent episode) was defined as a positive fungal culture for Candida species and a clinical signs and symptoms score of ≥3. To calculate the signs and symptoms score, each vulvovaginal sign (erythema, edema, excoriation) and symptom (itching, burning, irritation) was scored using the following scale, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome.\n\n0 = none (complete absence of any sign or symptom), 1 = mild (slight), 2 = moderate (definitely present), 3 = severe (marked, intense)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"42.8","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":217},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Bacterial vaginosis","Urinary tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache"]}}}
