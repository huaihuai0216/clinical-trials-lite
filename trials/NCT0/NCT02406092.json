\\[(Sum of completed item (question) responses / Number of completed items) - 1\\] x 100 / (Maximum possible item response value - Minimum possible item response value)\n\nThe final RASQ domains is calculated using the formula:\n\nRASQ domain score = (Mean of completed item responses - 1) x 25, scores ranging from 1-100 with higher scores indicative of more positive feelings toward therapy.
