The primary hypothesis is that the change from baseline in A1C in participants treated with the addition of sitagliptin is non-inferior compared to that in participants treated with the addition of dapagliflozin after 24 weeks of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in A1C at Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sitagliptin","deltaMin":-0.51,"sd":null},{"arm":"Dapagliflozin","deltaMin":-0.36,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.006"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["38770818","30019498"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":307},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia"]}}
