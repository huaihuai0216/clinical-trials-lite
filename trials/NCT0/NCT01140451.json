A specific type of mutation called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of CF in approximately 10% of patients with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation. This study is a Phase 3 extension trial that will evaluate the long-term safety of ataluren in adult and pediatric participants with nonsense mutation CF (nmCF), as determined by adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. The study will also assess changes in pulmonary function, CF pulmonary exacerbations, health-related quality of life, antibiotic use for CF-related infections, CF-related disruptions to daily living, body weight, and CF pathophysiology. Funding source for this study is the FDA OOPD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 1 [Total Study Week 48]) up to 4 Weeks Post-Treatment (Week 100 [Total Study Week 148]) or Premature Discontinuation (PD) (whichever occurred first)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ataluren/Ataluren","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo/Ataluren","deltaMin":97.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":31,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.ptcbio.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":48,"n":95},"commonTop":["Cystic fibrosis lung","Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Cough","Pyrexia","Haemoptysis"]}}
