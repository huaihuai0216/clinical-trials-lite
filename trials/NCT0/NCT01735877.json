The patients were asked to ﬁnd and mark the centre of each line in turn. Errors away from true midline were measured, with leftward errors being given a negative sign, rightward errors a positive sign.\n\nWe took an absolute value for the change in error. The values for baseline to 1 month were calculated by subtracting baseline values from 1 month values. Then, the mean change was calculated for baseline to 1 month. Similar method was followed for the calculation of mean change in baseline to 3 months and 6 months.\n\nThe patients responses were similar for the three lines that they marked hence we took the first line for the interpretation. None of the patients had extreme errors like missed marking at 3 and 6 months.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.45","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.42","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.50","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.55","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.03","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.40","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Picture Identification Task at 1,3, and 6 Months","description":"PIT consisted of 10 pictures on A4 size paper and patients were asked to identify pictures.
