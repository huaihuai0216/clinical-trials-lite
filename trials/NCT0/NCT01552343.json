Previous participation in FE992026 CS40 or FE992026 CS41 with a completion ≥ 30 days prior to Screening. The subject should have responded to active treatment during FE992026 CS40 or FE992026 CS41 or if he/she received placebo during these two studies he/she should have been a non-responder.\n4.

Chronic prostatitis (males)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS)\n2. Suspicion of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) or a urine flow of \\< 5 mL/s as confirmed by uroflowmetry performed after suspicion of BOO\n3. Surgical treatment, including transurethral resection, for BOO or benign prostatic hyperplasia (males) within the past six months\n4. Urinary retention or a post void residual volume \\> 150 mL for females and \\> 250 mL for males as confirmed by bladder ultrasound performed after suspicion of urinary retention\n5. Central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus\n6. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone\n7. Current or a history of urologic malignancies e.g. bladder cancer\n8.
