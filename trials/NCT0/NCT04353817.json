An LCI of 7.5 and below is normal; values greater than 7.5 are abnormal. LCI is able to detect abnormalities in lung function earlier than more traditional modalities such as spirometry.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.02","spread":"0.16"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.29","spread":"0.16"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Absolute Change in Sweat Chloride (SwCl)","description":"Sweat samples were collected using an approved collection device.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.9","spread":"1.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-52.1","spread":"1.5"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Safety and Tolerability as Assessed by Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":61},"commonTop":["Cough","Headache","Abdominal pain","Nasopharyngitis","Infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis"]}}}
