Insulin secretion will be assessed using mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide.\n\nSubjects will be assigned to receive either otelixizumab or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 (2/3 otelixizumab, 1/3 placebo). These study agents will be administered as an addition to insulin, diet, and other physician determined standard of care treatments.\n\nDEFEND-1 is now closed to enrollment.\n\nDEFEND-2 will begin early in 2010. It is very similar to DEFEND-1 and will again require subjects with new onset type 1 diabetes. Please check back here for more details.\n\nIn the meantime, established and new onset type 1 diabetes patients in North America are welcome to consider the TTEDD study:\n\nhttp://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00451321?term=TTEDD\\&rank=1","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in 2-hour Mixed Meal Stimulated C-peptide Area Under Curve [AUC] (Normalized for 120-minute Time Interval) at Month 12","timeFrame":"Baseline (0-120 minutes on Day 1) and Month 12 (0-120 minutes)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.21,"sd":0.03},{"arm":"Otelixizumab","deltaMin":-0.21,"sd":0.021}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.813"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":109,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","Finland","Germany","Italy","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15972866","19111162"],"seeAlso":["http://www.defendagainstdiabetes.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":91},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Fatigue","Oropharyngeal pain"]}}
