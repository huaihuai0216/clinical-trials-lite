At the trial's completion, a mixed-methods approach will be used to identify the components that were efficacious within the proposed cost constraint, along with feasibility and acceptability to providers and subjects. The investigators will then assemble an intervention that maximizes efficacy, given a cost-effectiveness constraint and findings from a qualitative analysis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Tobacco Abstinence","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI)","deltaMin":71,"sd":null},{"arm":"Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) CONTROL","deltaMin":49,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)","deltaMin":76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) CONTROL","deltaMin":44,"sd":null},{"arm":"Quitline (QL)","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"Quitline (QL) CONTROL","deltaMin":54,"sd":null},{"arm":"Text","deltaMin":61,"sd":null},{"arm":"Text CONTROL","deltaMin":59,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".01"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":".001"},{"comp":"OG004 vs OG005","p":"0.14"},{"comp":"OG006 vs OG007","p":"0.64"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29287665"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":66},"commonTop":[]}}
