Subject with history of vigabatrin use but either no visual fields examination report available including standard static (Humphrey or Octopus) or kinetic perimetry (Goldman) or results of these examinations are abnormal\n* Subject taking any drug with possible central nervous system (CNS) effects except if stable from at least 1 month before V1 and expected to be kept stable during the

vascular disease\n* Subject has a lifetime history of suicide attempt or has suicidal ideation in the past 6 months\n* Subject has ongoing psychiatric disease other than mild controlled
