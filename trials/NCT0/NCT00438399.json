However, they are not always ideal because they might be inconvenient and messy to use, stain or damage hair.\n\nThe test shampoo, Clobetasol propionate Shampoo 0.05% (marketed in the USA under the tradename of ClobexÂ®) was developed to provide the strongest available corticosteroid as a short-contact therapy in order to improve the chances of it being effective and reduce the potential for traditional side-effects.\n\nThe objective of this study is to compare subject's overall preference between Clobetasol propionate shampoo 0.05% and three other topical corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Subjects Preffering Clobetasol Propionate Shampoo Better Than Comparator","timeFrame":"End of period II (up to 16 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"C.
