CIED infections, defined as infections involving the generator implant site (pocket) and/or intravascular leads, have become increasingly prevalent, with the rate of growth in infections outpacing that of CIED procedures. The odds of both short term and long term mortality are at least doubled in patients who suffer CIED infections, and long term survival is particularly poor in women. Optimal strategies to prevent CIED infections in high-risk patients are largely unproven. However, recent observational studies of an antibiotic-coated envelope implanted at the time of CIED procedure have shown that this strategy is associated with a low incidence of CIED infections. Other interventions to prevent CIED infections, including the use of antibiotic irrigant used to wash the pocket during implantation and postoperative oral antibiotics, are commonly used but not supported by rigorous controlled studies. The Specific Aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the use of the antibacterial envelope alone is noninferior to a strategy using the antibacterial envelope and intraoperative antibacterial irrigant and postoperative oral antibiotics for the reduction of cardiac implantable device infections in patients with â‰¥2 risk factors for infection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With a Major Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIED) Infection","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Saline Irrigation","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Antibiotic Irrigation and Oral Antibiotics","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36960716"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":505},"commonTop":["Other non device related complication","Wound hematoma","Infection","Other device related complication","Lead dislodgement"]}}
