The trial will be conducted as a prospective, randomised design with the aim to collect safety and efficacy data.\n\nRespiratory function is globally accepted for assessment of treatment effects in IPF patients. The chosen endpoint (Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) decline) is easy to obtain and is part of the usual examinations done in IPF patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annual Rate of Decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Over 52 Weeks","timeFrame":"52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-239.91,"sd":18.709},{"arm":"Nintedanib 150mg Bid","deltaMin":-114.65,"sd":15.327}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":98,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","China","Czechia","France","Germany","India","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33902584","33239000","32217654","31914963","30971229","30729456","30176872","28526798","28388260","28039616","27672117","26400368","24836310","24834811"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":55,"n":204},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Cough","Bronchitis"]}}
