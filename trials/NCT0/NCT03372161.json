The ODI is a questionnaire completed by the subject that assesses10 topics: intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each question was scored on a scale of 0-5 with 0 indicating the least amount of disability and 5 indicating the most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered were summed, then multiplied by 2 to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero was equated with no disability and 100 was the maximum disability possible.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.89","spread":"14.906"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.76","spread":"12.896"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":202},"commonTop":["Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Urinary tract infection","Hypertension","Nausea"]}}}
