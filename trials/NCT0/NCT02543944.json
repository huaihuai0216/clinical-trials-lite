In addition, the acceptability and feasibility of transitioning to depot naltrexone therapy will also be determined. If successful, this study would provide data to support further development of gabapentin as a pharmacological tool for improved outcomes during opioid detoxification as well as an integrated outpatient approach for treating prescription opioid dependence.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Detoxification Phase: Changes in Percent of Illicit Opioid-positive Urine Samples Over Time","timeFrame":"Week 1 day 1 (study entry) through Week 4 day 1 (first day of NTX transition)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gabapentin","deltaMin":35,"sd":36.7},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":41.6,"sd":38.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.77"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Withdrawal symptoms","Headache","Sedation/drowsiness","Withdrawal sx: Stomach cramps","Withdrawal sx: Diarrhea"]}}
