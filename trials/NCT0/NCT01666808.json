Half of these patients will have radiotherapy decision-making and delivery per the usual routine, and half of these patients will have the radiotherapy decision and volumes guided by the FACBC test (anti-1-amino-3-\\[18F\\]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (anti-3- \\[18F\\]FACBC). The major goal of the investigation is to see whether the FACBC improves the selection and the cancer control rates of post-surgery patients with a rising PSA who undergo radiotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Failure-free Survival","timeFrame":"3-Year post-intervention","effectByArm":[{"arm":"FACBC PET Scan","deltaMin":75.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Conventional-Only Imaging","deltaMin":63,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33971152","35417762"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":83},"commonTop":["Urinary Frequency","Diarrhea"]}}
