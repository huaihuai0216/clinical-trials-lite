The effect of the stapling is similar to a common operation for GERD (partial fundoplication) but is done through the mouth, and incision into the abdomen is not needed.\n\nThe hypothesis of the study is that the treatment will be effective in improving GERD related quality of life by 50% or more in the majority of the subjects, and that the procedure will be as safe as surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With >= 50% Improvement in GERD Health Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL - Velanovich) Score","timeFrame":"Six months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Medigus SRS Endoscopic Stapling System","deltaMin":73,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States","Austria","Germany","India","Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25135443","26537905"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":72},"commonTop":["Chest pain","Sore throat","Atelectasis","Shoulder pain","Increase belching"]}}
