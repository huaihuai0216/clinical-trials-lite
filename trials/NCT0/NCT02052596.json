A prednisone dose of \\< 20 mg/day is allowed. Inhaled, topical and intra-articular corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s) and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine. This includes any type of vaccine such as (but not limited to) live, inactivated and subunit vaccines (e.g., inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines).\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs (e.g. infliximab) within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during the study period.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Previous vaccination against VZV or HZ and/or planned administration during the study of an HZ or VZV vaccine (including an investigational or non-registered vaccine) other than the study vaccine.\n* History of HZ.\n* Vaccination against diphtheria, or tetanus in the last five years or planned vaccination against diphtheria or tetanus during the study period, other than the study vaccine(s).\n* Administration of a combined tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccine at any time prior to study entry.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g., malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus \\[HIV\\] infection) or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (e.g., medications used during cancer chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat autoimmune disorders).\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines including prior severe allergic reaction following tetanus-toxoid, diphtheria-toxoid or pertussis-containing vaccine.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex. Note: The investigational HZ/su vaccine does not contain latex.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F by oral route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions before 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.\n* Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular (IM) injection unsafe.\n* Encephalopathy (e.g. coma, decreased consciousness, prolonged seizures) not attributable to an identifiable cause within 7 days of administration of a previous pertussis antigen-containing vaccine.\n* Progressive or unstable neurologic disorder.\n* History of Arthus-type hypersensitivity reaction following a prior dose of a tetanus-toxoid containing vaccine within the last 10 years.\n* History of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of a prior vaccine containing tetanus toxoid.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With a Vaccine Response for Anti-glycoprotein E (Anti-gE) in GSK1437173A Group","description":"This outcome was required only for the GSK1437173A Group.
