The study will be 56 weeks in duration; a 2-week run-in period followed by a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period. This will be followed by an open-label 40-week treatment period and a 2-week follow up phone call. All patients will receive the higher Aclidinium Bromide during the 40-week open label treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Part A: Morning Predose (Trough) Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"Change from baseline (Week 0) to Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.008,"sd":0.015},{"arm":"Aclidinium Bromide 200 μg","deltaMin":0.043,"sd":0.015},{"arm":"Aclidinium Bromide 400 μg","deltaMin":0.064,"sd":0.016}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.019"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0012"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":112,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24085591"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=4070&filename=las-md-38-synopsis.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":182},"commonTop":["COPD exacerbation","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
