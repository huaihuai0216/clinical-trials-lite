No potent symptomatic treatment is currently available. A disease-modifying therapy does not exist either. The growing understanding in recent years of the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease allows the development of new treatment options that have a modifying effect on the disease progression. Therefore, treatments are urgently required that effect the central underlying pathological mechanism, which appears to be the intracellular aggregation of toxic oligomers of α-synuclein.\n\nEGCG, a polyphenol found in green tea, has shown to inhibit the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers in vitro and has shown to transform α-synuclein-oligomers in non-toxic oligomer species. There is also evidence for a neuroprotective effect in MPTP-mouse models of PD and is an antioxidant and iron chelator. There are currently 63 clinical studies (http://clinicaltrial.gov) in which EGCG was applied for various indications, such as Multiple Sclerosis, various forms of cancer and Huntington's disease. All of which have shown good tolerability and safety with the applied doses of EGCG of up to 1200 mg per day, demonstrating the safety of the drug under controlled clinical conditions (see 5.3.1 for hepatotoxicity in uncontrolled conditions).\n\nThese data provide a solid rationale for testing in a clinical trial if supplementation of EGCG can interfere with the core disease mechanism in MSA and consequently retard the clinical progression of the MSA-related disability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change of Score in Motor Examination (ME) of the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS-ME) From V1 to V7.","timeFrame":"52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"EGCG as Putative Neuroprotective Agent","deltaMin":5.66,"sd":1.01},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.6,"sd":0.99}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.51"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18725592","15452868","20014118","19203998","11943691","14607318","18307243","20385841","11553681","15580809","17256961","12960117","16424063","22051807","19878722","22659482","21089750","21443877","31278067"],"seeAlso":["http://foxtrialfinder.michaeljfox.org/pages/find-trials/default.aspx/?keywords=PROMESA"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":47},"commonTop":["falls","gastrointestinal adverse event","UTI","worsening of parkinsonism, ataxia or autonomic dysfunction","urinary dysfunction"]}}
