Subjects will be randomized to receive XL184 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. XL184 is an investigational drug that inhibits VEGFR2, MET and RET, kinases implicated in tumor formation, growth and migration.\n\nThe Clinical Steering Committee for this study, comprised of study doctors who specialize in medullary thyroid cancer, has provided guidance regarding the design of the study. The committee includes: Douglas Ball, MD, Barry Nelkin, PhD, Martin Schlumberger, MD and Steven Sherman, MD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Treatment period consisted of 4-week cycles with radiologic tumor assessment every 12 weeks from date of randomization until date of first documented PD or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 34 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"XL184 (Cabozantinib)","deltaMin":11.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":113,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","India","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","Peru","Poland","Portugal","Russia","Saudi Arabia","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29045520","24002501"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":90,"n":214},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Fatigue","Nausea","Decreased appetite","Weight decreased"]}}
