All regimens will be administered as an addition to insulin and other standard of care treatments. Efficacy will be defined primarily by the capacity of MGA031 to markedly reduce typical insulin requirements while maintaining relatively normal blood sugar levels.\n\nOther studies involving the study drug use the name hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala). MGA031, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the name used for hOKT3γ1 (Ala-Ala) that is produced by MacroGenics, Inc. The United States Adopted Name (USAN) for MGA031 is teplizumab.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects in Segment 2 With Both a Total Daily Insulin Dose of Less Than 0.5 U/kg/Day and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Level of Less Than 6.5%.","timeFrame":"52 weeks after randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double-blind Herold Regimen","deltaMin":41,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-blind 33.3% Herold Regimen","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-blind Curtailed Herold Regimen","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-blind Placebo","deltaMin":20,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG004","p":"0.904"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG004","p":"0.222"},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":"0.885"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":115,"countries":["United States","Canada","Czechia","Estonia","Germany","India","Israel","Latvia","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Romania","Spain","Sweden","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39735417","21719095"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":38},"commonTop":["Lymphopenia","Leukopenia","Blood bicarbonate decreased","White blood cell count decreased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
