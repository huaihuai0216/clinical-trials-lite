Participant provision of a signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the participant has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study before any assessment is performed.\n2. A participant who is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and other study procedures.\n3. A participant in good general and mental health with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically qualified designee, no clinically significant/relevant abnormalities in medical history or upon oral examination, or condition, that would impact the participant's safety, wellbeing or the outcome of the study, if they were to participate in the study, or affect the individual's ability to understand and follow study procedures and requirements.\n4. Pregnant women: must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study and for 5 days after the last dose of assigned treatment.\n5. Participant has denture prostheses that fulfill all of the following:\n\n   1. A conventional acrylic full denture in either or both of the upper and lower arches. The full denture may be opposed by a partial denture, natural teeth or another full denture.\n   2. Dentures are well fitting (Kapur (Olshan Modification) Retention and Stability Index Sum Score â‰¥ 3 for each denture \\[maxillary and/or mandibular\\] with no individual stability or retention scores \\<1.\n\n   c Denture(s) are well made (according to the well-made assessment).\n6. Participant is a habitual wearer of their denture(s) defined as participants who wear their dentures for the majority of their time whilst awake.\n7. Participant has worn their full denture(s) for at least a year.\n8. Participant has not used any denture adhesive in the last year.\n9. Participant currently adopts acceptable denture cleansing habits and routine (a minimum would include daily brushing with a chemical cleaner such as toothpaste or soap, in addition to at least once a week soaking in commercial denture cleansing product). Unacceptable cleaning would include cleaning with water alone or using other non-specialized cleaning methods.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. A participant who is an employee of the investigational site, either directly involved in the conduct of the study or a member of their immediate family; or an employee of the investigational site otherwise supervised by the investigator; or, a GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH) employee directly involved in the conduct of the study or a member of their immediate family.\n2. A participant who has participated in other studies (including non-medicinal studies) involving investigational product(s) within 30 days prior to study entry and/or during study participation.\n3. A participant with, in the opinion of the investigator or medically qualified designee, an acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator or medically qualified designee, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into this study.\n4. A participant who is a pregnant female.\n5. A participant who is a breastfeeding female.\n6. A participant with known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.\n7.

A participant unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Considerations:\n\n   1. Participants will not be permitted to have any dental/denture work performed during the time they are in the study, unless discussed and permitted by the examiner. This is to ensure that the denture fit will not be altered during the study.\n   2. Participants will not be able to use any denture adhesive product other than that supplied by the investigator.\n   3. Participants should continue using their usual denture cleansing methodology throughout the study.\n9. A participant who has previously been enrolled in this study.\n10. A participant who has had recent (within 30 days) gingival surgery.\n11. Taking or have taken a bisphosphonate drug (i.e. Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva).\n12. A participant with any clinically significant or relevant oral abnormality (e.g. temporomandibular joint problems) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect the Participant's participation in the study.\n13. A participant with any condition or medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, is currently causing xerostomia.\n14. A participant with recent history (within the last year) of alcohol or other substance abuse.\n15. A participant with OST examination findings such as stomatitis, open sores, lesions, or swelling which in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the study. Mild, chronic conditions commonly expected from the use of dentures in the investigators opinion, are acceptable in this study.\n16.
