Men who decide to be part of the CAMUS trial will be given one out of two possible treatments at random. One out of every two men would get an inactive placebo treatment. One out of every two men would get Saw palmetto pills.\n\nThis kind of scientific study is the best way to find out if the plant extracts really work to prevent men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from getting worse. During the study, men will not know which of the two treatments they are assigned to. They will be followed very closely by a study team every 12 weeks to see how they are doing. Men in the CAMUS trial will be studied over 72 weeks. Tests and all medications needed as part of the study will be provided at no charge to the participant. Participants will be responsible for all other costs not associated with the study tests and medications. All information on study participants will be held in the strictest confidence and no one would have access to patient information other than the required authorized health care and research personnel.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean and Standard Deviation of the Participant American Urological Association (AUA)Symptom Score Between Baseline and Week 72 for CAMUS Participants.","timeFrame":"Baseline to 72 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Saw Palmetto","deltaMin":-2.2,"sd":5.83},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-2.99,"sd":5.65}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20007408","21554128","21741692","21497839","21954478","23083656"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":176},"commonTop":["BPH Symptoms","Cold","Back Pain","Diarrhea","Sinus Infection"]}}
