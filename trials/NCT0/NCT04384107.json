The hypotheses are that: 1) V114 is non-inferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes between V114 and PCV13 based on the response rates at 30 days following dose 3; 2) V114 is non-inferior to PCV13 for the 2 unique V114 serotypes based on the response rate of the 2 unique V114 serotypes at 30 days following dose 3; 3) V114 is non-inferior to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes between V114 and PCV13 based on anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPs) serotype-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) at 30 days following dose 3.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Solicited Injection-Site Adverse Events","timeFrame":"Day 1 to Day 14 post any vaccination, up to a total of 13.5 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"V114","deltaMin":88.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"PCV13","deltaMin":89.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.641"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.937"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.036"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.208"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":45,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37344262"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":347},"commonTop":["Injection site erythema","Injection site induration","Injection site swelling","Pyrexia","Irritability"]}}
