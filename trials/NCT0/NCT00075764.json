Hormone therapy using drugs such as anastrozole and fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen. It is not yet known whether anastrozole is more effective with or without fulvestrant in treating breast cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving anastrozole together with fulvestrant to see how well it works compared to anastrozole alone as first-line therapy in treating postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Tumor Progression","timeFrame":"Every 4 weeks while on treatment. Then every 3 months until progression, then six months for two years then annually until four years or until death, which ever occurs first.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I Anastrozole","deltaMin":13.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II Anastrozole and Fulvestrant","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.007"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":426,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36647745","30917258","28586789","22853014"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":21,"n":337},"commonTop":["Fatigue (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)","Hot flashes/flushes","Pain - Joint","Pain - Back","Nausea"]}}
