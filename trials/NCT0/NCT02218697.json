The decision to enrol should be based on the investigators clinical judgement.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject.\n* Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.\n\n  * Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject:\n\n  * has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and\n  * has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and\n  * has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose.

HIV infected subjects on cART with CD4 T-cell counts above 350 cells/mm3 can be enrolled.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F). The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be axillary.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever \\[≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F)\\] may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study or would make intramuscular (IM) injection unsafe.\n* Asplenia or dysfunction of the spleen.
