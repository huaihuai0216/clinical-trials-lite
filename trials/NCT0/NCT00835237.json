Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines can be administered at the discretion of the investigator when the subject comes back at Visit 2.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to vaccination or planned administration during the study period.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination.\n* History of serious allergic reaction following any other tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid or pertussis-containing vaccine or any component of the study vaccines.\n* History of encephalopathy within seven days of administration of a previous booster dose of pertussis vaccine that is not attributable to another identifiable cause.\n* Progressive neurologic disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy: pertussis vaccine should not be administered to individuals with these conditions until a treatment regimen has been established and the condition has stabilized.\n* Acute (active) clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by clinical evaluation or pre-existing laboratory screening tests.\n* Acute disease at the time of vaccination.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding vaccination, or planned administration during the study period.\n* Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with the evaluations required by the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of
