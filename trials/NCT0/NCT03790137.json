Seizure types associated with Sunflower Syndrome include absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Individuals with Sunflower Syndrome obsessively seek out a light source, stare at the light source, and wave one hand in front of their eye(s). Electroencephalogram (EEG) features include generalized spike and wave discharges interictally, and typically strong photoparoxysmal response during photic stimulation.\n\nCurrently, Sunflower syndrome is poorly characterized in medical literature and is often misunderstood at the clinical level. The name self-induced photosensitive epilepsy may be a misnomer as research concerning the neurochemical and neuropsychological pathways cannot conclusively determine that it is self-induced (conscious behavior) as the name implies. Although some reports have concluded that the hand waiving induces the seizure, these findings are not consistent throughout scientific literature. In fact, an EEG report found that the seizures can begin simultaneously with the hand waving. This suggests that the hand waving may in fact be part of the seizure, not the cause.\n\nThere are no treatments specifically approved for the treatment of Sunflower Syndrome in the United States. Broad spectrum anticonvulsant medications, including sodium valproate, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and clobazam, have not shown full efficacy in seizure prevention in patients with Sunflower Syndrome. Accordingly, there remains a significant unmet need for an approved treatment for children and adults with Sunflower Syndrome.\n\nBecause this epilepsy typically does not respond to anticonvulsant medications, and because Aicardi described the successful treatment with fenfluramine of at least one child with this syndrome, the investigators of this study will investigate if fenfluramine is an effective, safe and well tolerated treatment for Sunflower Syndrome.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of ZX008 on seizure frequency in children and young adults with Sunflower Syndrome. The goal of treatment is to provide a 30 percent or greater reduction of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or hand waving associated with absence seizures.\n\nSecondary objectives of the study include evaluation of the effect of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride) on EEG patterns and quality of life. Patients with Sunflower Syndrome often experience low self-esteem, bullying due to the unusual motor movements associated with their seizures, school performance issues, anxiety, and depression.\n\nThe study population will include pediatric and young adult patients seen by Elizabeth A. Thiele, M.D., Ph.D. at MGH's Pediatric Epilepsy Clinic who were identified as candidates. The Principal Investigator (PI) will follow up to 20 patients with Sunflower Syndrome who will be taking ZX008.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"% Change in Frequency of Handwaving Episodes","timeFrame":"Month 3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Group","deltaMin":-66.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":24},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["3932858","5132972","6854340","24556582","8892363","21474289","2463643","14124883","36562419"],"seeAlso":["https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/09/29/1134829/0/en/Zogenix-Announces-Positive-Top-line-Results-from-Pivotal-Phase-3-Clinical-Trial-of-ZX008-in-Dravet-Syndrome.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":["Reduced Appetite","Fatigue","Viral Illness","Nocturnal Enuresis","Diarrhea"]}}
