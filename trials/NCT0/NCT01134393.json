Mean in-clinic seated cuff Systolic BP \\>180 mmHg and SBP \\>160 mmHg in patients with diabetes or renal impairment or Diastolic BP \\>110 mmHg and DBP \\>100 mmHg in patients with diabetes or renal impairment. Renal impairment is defined as a creatinine \\>133µmol/l (1.5mg/dl) in male patients and a creatinine \\>124µmol/l (1.3mg/dl) in female patients or a creatinine clearance between 30-60 ml/min.\n4. Renal dysfunction as defined by the following laboratory parameters: Serum creatinine \\>3.0 mg/dl (or \\>265 ¿mol/L) and/or known creatinine clearance of \\<30 ml/min and/or clinical markers of severe renal impairment.\n5. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in a solitary kidney, post-renal transplant patients or patients with only one kidney.\n6. Clinically relevant hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia (i.e., \\<3.5 or \\>5.5 mEq/L).\n7. Uncorrected sodium or volume depletion.\n8. Primary aldosteronism.\n9. Hereditary fructose intolerance.\n10. Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association functional class Congestive Heart Failure III-IV (Refer to Appendix 10.1).\n11. Clinically significant ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or other clinically relevant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the Investigator.\n12. Biliary obstructive disorders (e.g., cholestasis) or hepatic insufficiency (defined as elevated levels of \\>2x bilirubin or \\>2x transaminases values). (Refer to Appendix 10.3)\n13. Patients who have previously experienced symptoms characteristic of angioedema during treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists.\n14. History of drug or alcohol dependency within six months prior to signing the informed consent form.\n15. Any investigational drug therapy within one month of signing the informed consent.\n16. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the trial drugs (telmisartan or amlodipine).\n17. History of non-compliance or inability to comply with prescribed medications or protocol procedures.\n18. Any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of the trial medication.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Patients Achieving Blood Pressure (BP) Control After 12 Weeks of Treatment Using In-clinic BP Measurements.","description":"Achieving BP control is defined as SBP\\<140 mmHg and DBP\\<90 mmHg.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"67.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"BP Control After 4 and 8 Weeks of Treatment Using In-clinic BP Measurements.","description":"Achieving BP control is defined as SBP\\<140 mmHg and DBP\\<90 mmHg.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"262","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"330","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"BP Control (Morning and Evening) After 12 Weeks of Treatment Using Home Blood Pressure Measurement (HBPM).","description":"Achieving BP control with HBPM is defined as SBP\\<135 mmHg and DBP\\<85 mmHg.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"179","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"172","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline Over Time in In-clinic Measured Mean SBP and Mean DBP","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-13.58","spread":"11.95"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-16.37","spread":"12.34"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-16.92","spread":"12.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-8.24","spread":"8.77"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.33","spread":"8.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-10.43","spread":"8.83"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline Over Time in In-clinic Measured Mean Pulse Rate","description":"Pulse pressure was not analysed for this study instead pulse rate was analysed at weeks 4, 8 and 12.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.43","spread":"9.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.32","spread":"9.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.51","spread":"9.25"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline Over Time in In-clinic Measured Mean Pulse Pressure","description":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"DBP and SBP Control and Response Rates After 4, 8 and 12 Weeks of Treatment Using In-clinic BP Measurements","description":"DBP control is defined as DBP \\<90 mmHg or \\<80 mmHg in patients with diabetes or renal impairment.
