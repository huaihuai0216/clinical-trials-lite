Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to an appropriate seasonal allergen (ie, prevailing trees and/or grasses) must be documented by a positive response to the skin prick test with wheal diameter at least 3 mm larger than diluent control after 20 minutes.\n* Must be clinically symptomatic at the Screening Visit.\n* Must be clinically symptomatic at the Baseline Visit.\n* Must be in general good health as confirmed by routine clinical and laboratory testing and electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Clinical laboratory test (complete blood count \\[CBC\\], blood chemistries, and urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator and the sponsor.\n* Must be free of any clinically significant disease, other than SAR, that would interfere with the study evaluations.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A history of anaphylaxis and/or other severe local reaction(s) to skin testing.\n* A subject with asthma who requires chronic use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids.\n* Current or history of frequent, clinically significant sinusitis or chronic purulent postnasal drip.\n* A subject with rhinitis medicamentosa.\n* A history of allergies to more than two classes of medications or who are allergic to or cannot tolerate nasal sprays.\n* A subject who has had an upper respiratory tract or sinus infection that required antibiotic therapy without at least a 14-day washout prior to the Screening Visit, or who has had a viral upper respiratory infection within 7 days before the Screening Visit.\n* A subject who has nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps and marked septal deviations, which significantly interfere with nasal air flow.\n* A subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is dependent on nasal, oral, or ocular decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Average AM Instantaneous (NOW) Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over Days 2 to 15","description":"TNSS was defined as the sum of the following four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion/stuffiness, nasal itching, sneezing; each symptom scored on a scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.
