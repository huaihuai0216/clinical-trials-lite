The sample size will include 27 subjects in each of the two arms of the study (retapamulin versus placebo) for a total of 54 subjects. Participants who are found to be nasal and/or rectal colonized with MRSA will be randomized to receive either retapamulin or placebo applied nasally and rectally for a total of 5 days. Nasal and rectal swabs will be collected at pre-defined time points during study duration (screening swab, swab one week after completion of topical therapy, swab 4 weeks after completion of topical therapy) to assess MRSA colonization status. The colonization rates of both groups will be assessed via Fisher's Exact Test.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With MRSA Carriage at 1 Week Post Decolonization With Retapamulin or Placebo","timeFrame":"1 Week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Retapamulin","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["Local application site irritation"]}}
