All diabetic subjects will be treated with injected insulin for 2 weeks prior to study, to avoid potential confounding effects of other antidiabetic agents.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Chronic illnesses or infections (other than type 2 diabetes)\n* Known coronary artery disease or abnormal ECG on screening evaluation\n* Blood pressure \\> 160/100 mmHg on two occasions during screening evaluations. Current use of 3 or fewer blood pressure medications with blood pressure below this cutpoint will be acceptable.\n* Total cholesterol \\> 240 mg/dL. Current use of 2 or fewer lipid lowering agents with cholesterol below this cutpoint will be acceptable.\n* Diabetic subjects: Treatment with a GLP-1 agonist or DPP4 inhibitor within the past 6 months\n* Known intolerance to injected GLP-1 agonist\n* Treatment with PPAR gamma agonists currently or within the past 6 months\n* Recognized microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)\n* Unwillingness or inability to use injected insulin for the purposes of this study\n* Chronic pain or other physical conditions which limit ability to remain supine for the duration of the study protocol\n* History of claustrophobia, musculoskeletal or other factors which would result in an inability to comfortably remain within PET scanner gantry for the duration of the imaging protocol\n* Occupational, investigational or other known radiation exposure which, together with the planned radiologic studies, will result in greater than 500 mrem total exposure in a contiguous 12 month period\n* For female participants, current pregnancy","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Myocardial Glucose Uptake.","description":"Myocardial glucose uptake measured using 18FDG PET, quantified using a 3-compartment model with a lumped constant of 1.0.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.46","spread":"8.49"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.22","spread":"9.26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.05","spread":"0"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"20.89","spread":"12.47"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"5.57","spread":"19.39"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Myocardial Blood Flow","description":"Myocardial perfusion derived from acetate kinetics","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34.66","spread":"4.60"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.44","spread":"9.17"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"47.61","spread":"0"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"35.30","spread":"7.35"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"51.19","spread":"19.39"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Myocardial Total Oxidation Rate","description":"MVO2 derived from acetate kinetics","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.25","spread":"2.39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.21","spread":"14.32"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"65.30","spread":"0"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"18.57","spread":"3.78"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"59.85","spread":"30.47"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Cardiac Index","description":"Impedance cardiography-derived measurement of cardiac index, assessed following 12 hour exposure to treatment condition concurrent with the PET measurements.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.00","spread":"0.52"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.88","spread":"0.31"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"2.90","spread":"0.51"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"GLP-1 Concentrations","description":"Achieved GLP-1 concentrations at the end of the 12 hour treatment exposure","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"61.7","spread":"33.5"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"302.1","spread":"149.1"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"307.8","spread":"86.2"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":["Nausea"]}}}
