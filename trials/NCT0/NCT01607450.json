Four groups of 10 lean healthy subjects will be studied during infusions of 0 (saline control), 0.5, 1.5, and 4.0 pmol/kg/min GLP-1 (one study per subject). Cardiac metabolism will be measured using PET, using a dual-tracer approach which allows measurement of myocardial glucose uptake (the primary endpoint) along with total oxidation rate and myocardial perfusion (secondary endpoints). In concert with measures of circulating metabolites and regulatory hormones, the investigators will produce the most comprehensive assessment of actions of GLP-1 on myocardial metabolism in humans to date. Effects of each dose will be compared to the saline control, plus the investigators will combine all data and use nonlinear curve-fitting to derive sensitivity (ED50) and maximal responses for GLP-1 effects on myocardial glucose uptake.\n\nAim 2: To measure the effects of GLP-1 infusion on myocardial fuel selection in obese type 2 diabetic humans under fasting (fatty acid-dominant) conditions Four groups of 10 obese type 2 diabetic subjects will be studied during infusions of 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.0 pmol/kg/min GLP-1 as under Aim 1. Analyses will be parallel to those described under Aim 1. Results from Aims 1 and 2 will be combined to allow direct comparison of the dose-response between nondiabetic control and type 2 diabetic subjects.\n\nNo literature has been published to inform dose selection in the design of clinical trials of GLP-1 for modulation of heart fuel selection. With our expertise and experience in PET measurement of heart metabolism in diabetes, the investigators are uniquely positioned to fill this gap in knowledge. These studies are a necessary preamble to further evaluation of the potential for GLP-1 based treatments in heart disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Myocardial Glucose Uptake.","timeFrame":"After 12 hours of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) exposure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lean Saline","deltaMin":7.46,"sd":8.49},{"arm":"Lean GLP-1 Low Dose","deltaMin":7.22,"sd":9.26},{"arm":"Type 2 DM GLP-1 Low Dose","deltaMin":0.05,"sd":0},{"arm":"Lean GLP-1 1.5 Pmol/kg/Min","deltaMin":20.89,"sd":12.47},{"arm":"Type 2DM GLP-1 1.5 Pmol/kg/Min","deltaMin":5.57,"sd":19.39}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":["Nausea"]}}
