Patients with confirmed diagnosis of Cushing's disease as evidenced by mean urinary free cortisol of three 24-hour urine samples collected during the 3-week screening period above the upper limit of the laboratory normal range morning plasma ACTH within the normal or above normal range either MRI confirmation of pituitary adenoma (greater than or equal to 0.6 cm), or inferior petrosal sinus gradient \\>3 after CRH stimulation for those patients with a microadenoma less than 0.6 cm, or for patients who have had prior pituitary surgery, histopathology confirming an ACTH staining adenoma.\n4. Patients with de novo Cushing's disease must not be considered as candidates for pituitary surgery (i.e. poor surgical candidates, surgically unapproachable tumors, patients with no visible pituitary tumor, patients who refuse to have surgical treatment)\n5. Karnofsky performance status \\>60 (i.e. requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his personal needs)\n6. For patients on previous medical treatment for Cushing's disease the following washout periods must be completed before screening assessments are performed\n\n   * Inhibitors of steroidogenesis (e.g. ketoconazole, metyrapone, rosiglitazone): 1 week\n   * Dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine, cabergoline): 4 weeks\n   * Mitotane: 6 months\n   * Octreotide LAR and Lanreotide autogel: 8 weeks\n   * Lanreotide SR: 4 weeks\n   * Octreotide (immediate release formulation): 1 week\n   * Glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor (mifepristone): 4 weeks\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1.
