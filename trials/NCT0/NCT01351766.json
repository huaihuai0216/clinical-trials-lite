In the first phase we utilize focus groups and pilot testing with 15 youths to develop the behavioral activation smoking treatment for youth. In Phase II, we will conduct an open-label trial of the new treatment that will include 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine patch, which will begin at the time of quitting smoking. Participants will be followed over 26 weeks post-quit date. A subset of participants will also undergo an fMRI session to examine reward sensitivity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Smoking-Abstinent for 7 Days, 12 Weeks Post Quit Date","timeFrame":"12 weeks post quit date","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Behavioral Activation for Smoking","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":39},"commonTop":[]}}
