The newer \"atypical\" antipsychotics agents, such as olanzapine, has shown improvement in the treatment of negative symptoms in acute trials. The purpose of this study is to compare an investigational compound (asenapine) with a marketed agent (olanzapine) in the treatment of stable subjects with persistent negative symptoms of schizophrenia for 6 months. Patients completing this study may be eligible to participate in an extension 6 months of treatment. Patients are required to have stable symptoms prior to entry into study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia Measured by the Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA) Scale Total Score","timeFrame":"Day 182","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Asenapine","deltaMin":60.4,"sd":0.8},{"arm":"Olanzapine","deltaMin":61.3,"sd":0.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.7177"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["22198451"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":30,"n":244},"commonTop":["SOMNOLENCE","WEIGHT INCREASED","INSOMNIA","HEADACHE","ANXIETY"]}}
