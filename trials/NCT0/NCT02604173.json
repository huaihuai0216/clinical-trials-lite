The investigators will accomplish these objectives with a prospective, double blinded view of a large population of hikers who are ascending at their own rate in a true hiking environment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Acute Mountain Sickness","timeFrame":"24 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Budesonide","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Acetazolamide","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28668540"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":33},"commonTop":[]}}
