Ambulatory adults aged 50 and older.\n2. Medically stable, as determined by medical history and targeted physical examination. \"Medically stable\" is defined as no change in diagnoses or chronic medications (dose or class) for medical reasons in the 3 months prior to study.\n3. Absence of underlying conditions that make participation in the study contrary to the subject's best interest.\n4. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures.\n5. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedure.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known contraindication to either study vaccine (see product package inserts)\n2. Receipt of any other influenza vaccine within 180 days prior to enrollment in this study.\n3. Underlying disease or ongoing therapy that might cause immunocompromise, e.g. cytotoxic agents or supraphysiologic doses of corticosteroids, such that response to vaccination might be sub-optimal.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50
