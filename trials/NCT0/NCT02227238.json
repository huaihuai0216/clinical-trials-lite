Recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation may be considered as evidence of serious suicide risk.\n* Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening.\n* Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening: radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, systemically administered immunomodulators.\n* Treatment with any agent, other than licensed ART as allowed above with documented activity against HIV-1 in vitro/vivo within 28 days of first dose of IP. The exception is use of entecavir, in appropriate clinical situations, for treatment of hepatitis B \\[e.g. prior intolerance to Tenofovir (TDF), viral resistance to lamivudine (3TC) / Emtricitabine (FTC)\\] after discussion and agreement between the investigator and the medical monitor.\n* Exposure to an experimental drug or experimental vaccine within either 28 days, 5 half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the test agent, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of IP.\n* Any evidence of primary viral resistance to PIs or INIs based on the presence of any major resistance-associated mutation.\n* The subject's virus does not yield results using genotype at Screening (assay data is essential for eligibility determination).\n* Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality, with the exception of Grade 4 triglycerides.
