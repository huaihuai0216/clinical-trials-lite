Pain Intensity scores at each timepoint are based on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 = no pain to 100 = worst pain imaginable. PID is calculated as the timepoint score less the baseline pre-dose score (i.e. PID.5 = PI.5 - PI0).\n\nSPID48 = the PID for each timepoint multiplied by a time weighting factor; which is the difference (in hours) between the PID observation and prior observation.
