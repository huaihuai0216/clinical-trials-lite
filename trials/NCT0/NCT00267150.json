The GSRS has 5 subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation,abdominal pain, and indigestion) producing a mean subscale score ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (very severe discomfort). The GSRS total score was computed by the mean of the subscale scores. The primary analysis examined changes from Visit 1 (baseline) to Visit 2 (6-8 weeks) by computing the difference of GSRS total score.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.46","spread":"0.71"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Gastrointestinal Symptoms Under MMF-based Immunosuppressive Therapy","description":"Assessed by GI complications at baseline.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":31},"commonTop":["Constipation"]}}}
