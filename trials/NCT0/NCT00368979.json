Diagnosis: BPH\n2. Age: ≥50 years\n3. Gender: Male\n4. Estimated prostate volume ≥30cc (by TRUS)\n5. I-PSS Symptom Score (total of 7 items) ≥8 points\n6. Maximum flow rate (Qmax) ≤15mL/sec (voided volume measured simultaneously ≤150mL)\\*\\[1\\]\n7. Patients who meet either of the following regarding tamsulosin HCl use:\n\n   Patients with tamsulosin HCl use:\n\n   Patients who have received tamsulosin HCl continuously for at least 4 weeks and who are likely to continue to take tamsulosin HCl without any change to the dosage and administration of the drug until the end of study treatment.\n\n   Patients without tamsulosin HCl use:\n\n   Patients who haven't received tamsulosin HCl in the past 4 weeks and who are unlikely to use tamsulosin HCl until the end of study treatment.\n8.
