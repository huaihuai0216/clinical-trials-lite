The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom).
