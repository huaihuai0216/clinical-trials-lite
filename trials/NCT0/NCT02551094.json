Patients who have suffered a documented acute myocardial infarction within the last 30 days, are treated according to the national guidelines and after having completed any planned percutaneous revascularization procedures associated with their initial infarction will receive either colchicine (0.5 mg per day) or matching placebo (1:1 allocation ratio) for an estimated 2 years period or until the target of 301 primary endpoints has been reached.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"First Event of Cardiovascular Death, Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest, Acute Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, or Urgent Hospitalization for Angina Requiring Coronary Revascularization","timeFrame":"From randomization to occurence of first event, assessed up to 3.5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Colchicine Placebo","deltaMin":170,"sd":null},{"arm":"Colchicine","deltaMin":131,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32860034","31733140"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":404,"n":2346},"commonTop":["Diarrhea AE","Other","Nauseau AE","Anaemia AE","Flatulence AE"]}}
