The movement (6 months minus baseline) of soft tissue landmarks was measured before and after 6 months of the maxillary LeFort I osteotomy.\n\nThe 3D directional movement of each point was measured in the x(transverse), y(vertical), and z (antero-posterior)planes. The positive directional movement of each point in X axis means the point moved left after surgery, and negative directional movement in X axis means the the point moved right after surgery. The positive directional movement in Y axis means the point moved upward after surgery, and negative directional movement in Y axis means the the point moved downward after surgery. The positive directional movement in Z axis means the point moved anteriorly after surgery, and negative directional movement in Z axis means the the point moved posteriorly after surgery.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.95","spread":"1.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.5","spread":"1.09"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.95","spread":"2.10"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.32","spread":"2.82"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.50","spread":"2.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.71","spread":"2.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.22","spread":"1.50"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.58","spread":"1.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.58","spread":"1.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.95","spread":"2.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.11","spread":"2.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.83","spread":"2.97"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.86","spread":"1.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.30","spread":"1.44"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.08","spread":"1.82"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.58","spread":"2.40"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.42","spread":"3.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.91","spread":"2.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.35","spread":"1.70"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.14","spread":"1.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.29","spread":"1.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.12","spread":"1.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.48","spread":"1.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.08","spread":"1.43"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.67","spread":"1.88"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.05","spread":"1.13"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.62","spread":"1.32"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.21","spread":"0.97"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.08","spread":"1.89"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.03","spread":"1.55"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.74","spread":"2.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.00","spread":"1.64"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.03","spread":"2.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.90","spread":"1.78"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.03","spread":"2.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.42","spread":"2.06"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"14
