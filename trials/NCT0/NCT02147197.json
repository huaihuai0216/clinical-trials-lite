The first 8 questions comprise the Symptom Severity subscale to assess symptoms experienced by women with uterine leiomyomas, the remaining 29 questions comprise 6 subscales (Concern, Activities, Energy/mood, Control, Self-consciousness, Sexual Function) which overall deal with women's feelings and experiences regarding impact of uterine leiomyoma symptoms on her life. Each item is scored between 1 and 5, where 1=none of the time or not at all and 5=all of the time or a very great deal. A Revised Activities subscale was created to include the most relevant items pertaining to physical and social activities with a total possible score of 0 to 100. Higher Revised Activities subscale scores indicate less impact on activities. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34.51","spread":"26.41"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29.60","spread":"23.34"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"28.15","spread":"23.39"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.26","spread":"27.52"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"53.00","spread":"34.36"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"61.04","spread":"31.99"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":56},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Blood creatine phosphokinase increased","Hot flush","Nausea","Acne"]}}}
