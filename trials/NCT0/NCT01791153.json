The study will consist of 2 parts: a 52-week double-blind treatment period (Part 1) followed by a 104-week open label long-term follow-up period (Part 2). In Part 1 of the study eligible participants will be randomized to receive either tocilizumab every week (qw) or every 2 weeks (q2w) or placebo for 52 weeks, with tapering oral daily doses of prednisone. After Week 52, participants in remission will stop study treatment and enter long-term follow-up, whereas participants with disease activity or flares will receive open-label tocilizumab or other treatment at the discretion of the investigator for a maximum period of 104 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants in Sustained Remission at Week 52 (Tocilizumab + 26 Weeks Prednisone Taper Versus Placebo + 26 Weeks Prednisone Taper)","timeFrame":"Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 1: Tocilizumab qw + 26 Weeks Prednisone Taper","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 1: Tocilizumab q2w + 26 Weeks Prednisone Taper","deltaMin":53.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 1: Placebo + 26 Weeks Prednisone Taper","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":78,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38279390","34718434","34049857","30835950","30786937","28745999"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":100},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Arthralgia","Back pain","Oedema peripheral"]}}
