The objective of Period 1 is to evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib in combination with a 26-week corticosteroid (CS) taper regimen compared to placebo in combination with a 52-week CS taper regimen, as measured by the proportion of participants in sustained remission at Week 52, and to assess the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib in participants with giant cell arteritis (GCA). The objective of Period 2 is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuing versus withdrawing upadacitinib in maintaining remission in participants who achieved sustained remission in Period 1.\n\nSafety and efficacy data through 06 February 2024 are included in the interim analysis, which was conducted after all participants completed the Week 52 visit or discontinued from the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Remission at Week 52","timeFrame":"From Week 12 to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo + 52-week CS Taper","deltaMin":29,"sd":null},{"arm":"7.5 mg Upadacitinib + 26-week CS Taper","deltaMin":41.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"15 mg Upadacitinib + 26-week CS Taper","deltaMin":46.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"=0.0019"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.0579"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":172,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40174237","38840219"],"seeAlso":["https://www.abbvieclinicaltrials.com/study/?id=M16-852"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":24,"n":112},"commonTop":["GIANT CELL ARTERITIS","COVID-19","HEADACHE","ARTHRALGIA","HYPERTENSION"]}}
