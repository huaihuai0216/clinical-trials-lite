Up to 82% of community dwelling individuals with PD complain of sleep disturbances, typically sleep fragmentation. Despite the high prevalence of sleep problems and their impact on the life of these individuals, there has been, until recently, little research focus on the problem. This will be a multi-site, double blind, placebo-controlled, two arm, parallel group, fixed-dose trial which will last 6 weeks. Seventy patients at four sites (30 at the PI's site and a total of 40 patients at three external sites) will be equally randomized to eszopiclone or placebo. The primary hypothesis is that eszopiclone will be superior to placebo for the treatment of insomnia in patients with Parkinson's disease","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"TST","timeFrame":"6 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Eszopiclone","deltaMin":5.7,"sd":1.16},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6,"sd":1.16}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20589875"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["daytime fatigue","sedation","dizziness","increase Parkinson's related rigidity"]}}
