The primary safety and tolerability endpoint is the frequency of all adverse events, including serious adverse events. For new participants, the total duration of participant participation in the study is planned to be up to 80 weeks (including a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 12-week oral conversion/stabilization stage \\[Stage 1\\], a 56-week double-blind maintenance stage \\[Stage 2\\], and a follow-up period \\[8 weeks\\]). For roll-over participants, the total duration of participant participation in the study is planned to be up to 64 weeks (including up to 56 weeks in the maintenance stage \\[Stage 2\\] and a follow-up period \\[8 weeks\\]). Participants who started Stage 2 who relapse or meet 1 or more of the withdrawal criteria should be invited to perform the Early Termination visit as soon as possible within 4 weeks of the last injection. Participants who withdraw from the study before completing the 56-week maintenance stage will have follow-up procedures and assessments performed at their follow-up visits. During the follow-up period, participants will be treated according to the investigator's judgment.\n\nAll participants will be treated with active drug.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)","timeFrame":"Baseline up to Week 64","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TV-46000 q1m","deltaMin":64,"sd":null},{"arm":"TV-46000 q2m","deltaMin":74,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":90,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Canada","France","Israel"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40730715","38954317"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":172},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site nodule"]}}
