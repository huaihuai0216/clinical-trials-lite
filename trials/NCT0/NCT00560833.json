Participants self-administered the WHQ questionnaire; scoring is based on a 4-point scale as follows: 'Yes definitely=1', 'Yes sometimes=2', 'No not much=3' and 'No not at all=4'. Each score is transformed to a value '1' for scores '1' and '2' and to a value '0' for scores '3' and '4'. Vasomotor symptoms encompass Items 19 and 27 of the 36 total items. The transformed sums of items 19+27 are divided by 2 to get the score; therefore, the domain ranges from 0 to 1, where lower values are better.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.984","spread":"0.088"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.993","spread":"0.060"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.985","spread":"0.085"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.981","spread":"0.114"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"0.985","spread":"0.085"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.151","spread":"0.329"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.235","spread":"0.355"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.256","spread":"0.355"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.256","spread":"0.372"},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"-0.246","spread":"0.385"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 12","description":"Participants recorded the frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment.
