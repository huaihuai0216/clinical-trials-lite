Inhaled, intra-articularly injected, and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella within 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo.\n* Planned administration during the study of a HZ vaccine (including an investigational or non-registered vaccine) other than the study vaccine.\n* Previous chemotherapy course less than one month before first study vaccination.\n* Occurrence of a varicella or HZ episode by clinical history within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine or study material and equipment.\n* Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a non-replicating vaccine within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n* HIV infection by clinical history.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination. Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever, but excludes the underlying malignancy, as well as the expected symptoms/signs associated with that disease or its treatment:\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F on oral, axillary or tympanic setting, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever, may receive the first dose of study vaccine/ placebo at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 3 (i.e., 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine/ placebo).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Adjusted Geometric Means for Anti-glycoprotein E (gE) Antibodies in PreChemo Groups","description":"Adjusted geometric means (GMC) of GSK1437173A over placebo for anti-glycoprotein E (gE) antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) concentrations in PreChemo Groups only.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24501.57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1056.77","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Anti-Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) gE Antibody Concentrations","description":"Antibody concentrations as determined by ELISA are presented as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) and expressed in milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL).
