Most patients have progressive hearing and visual loss, leading to deafness and blindness, as well as neurological deterioration. There are no therapies for this disorder. A misfolded protein with residual function, PEX1-Gly843Asp, represents one third of all mutant alleles. Using patient cell lines with this mutation, we reported the recovery of peroxisome functions by treatment with Betaine, acting as a nonspecific chemical chaperone for the misfolded PEX1 protein. Betaine, or trimethylglycine, is a Health Canada and FDA approved orphan drug for the treatment of homocystinuria and is used by us safely and regularly in genetic medicine. We will perform a 6 month pilot study with 12 patients to test the hypothesis that Betaine, at recommended doses, can recover peroxisome biochemical functions in blood.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Peroxisome Biochemical Functions as Measured by Plasma Very Long Chain Fatty Acid","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Betaine","deltaMin":0.18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20212125"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Constipation","Change in body odor (skin, urine, and/or breath)","Fatigue","Viral syndrome","Diarrhea"]}}
