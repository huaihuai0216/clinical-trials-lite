Tiotropium inhalation solution delivered by the Respimat® inhaler will be examined on top of maintenance treatment with inhaled corticosteroid controller medication in patients with moderate persistent asthma. Efficacy and safety will be assessed by measuring effects on lung function, effects on asthma exacerbations, effects on quality of life, effects on asthma control, effects on health care resource utilisation, and number of adverse events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Peak FEV1 Within 3 Hours Post-dose Response","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.053,"sd":0.021},{"arm":"Tio R2.5","deltaMin":0.289,"sd":0.021},{"arm":"Tio R5","deltaMin":0.25,"sd":0.021},{"arm":"Salmeterol","deltaMin":0.266,"sd":0.02}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":114,"countries":["United States","Brazil","China","Guatemala","India","Japan","Latvia","Mexico","Peru","Poland","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32180164","31654891","31319851","29174062","25682232"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":269},"commonTop":["Asthma","Peak expiratory flow rate decreased","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
