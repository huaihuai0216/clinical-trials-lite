All patients must sign and date an Informed Consent Form consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and local legislation prior to participation in the trial (i.e. prior to any trial procedures, including any pre-trial washout of medications and medication restrictions for pulmonary function test at Visit 1).\n2. Male or female patients aged at least 18 years but not more than 75 years.\n3. All patients must have at least a 3 month history of asthma at the time of enrolment into the trial. The diagnosis should be confirmed at Visit 1 by fulfilling inclusion criterion 5.\n4. The initial diagnosis of asthma must have been made before the patient's age of 40.\n5. The diagnosis of asthma has to be confirmed at Visit 1 with a bronchodilator reversibility (15 minutes after 400 mcg salbutamol (albuterol)) resulting in a Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) increase of at least 12% and at least 200mL.\n6. All patients must have been on maintenance treatment with a medium, stable dose of inhaled corticosteroids for at least for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n7. All patients must be symptomatic at Visit 1 (screening) and prior to randomisation at Visit 2 as defined by an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) mean score of at least 1.5.\n8. All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at least 60% and less than or equal to 90% of predicted normal at Visit 1.\n9.

Patients who have been treated with other non-approved and according to international guidelines not recommended \"experimental\" drugs for routine asthma therapy within four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period.\n24. Patients with any asthma exacerbation or any respiratory tract infection iin the four weeks prior to Visit 1 and/or during the screening period.\n25.
