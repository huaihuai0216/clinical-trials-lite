Patients at potentially high risk (e.g., very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished, or very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the Investigator.\n* Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin, sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.\n* Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices or persistent jaundice, cirrhosis, known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).Note: Chronic stable hepatitis B and C are acceptable if the subject otherwise meets entry criteria.\n* Clinically significant ECG abnormality: Evidence of a clinically significant abnormality in the 12-lead ECG performed during screening. The Investigator will determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following:\n\n  * Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate \\>120 beats per minute (bpm)\n  * Sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)\n  * Second degree heart block Mobitz type II and third degree heart block (unless pacemaker or defibrillator had been inserted)\n  * QT interval corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) greater than or equal to 500 milliseconds (msec) in patients with QRS \\<120 msec and QTcF greater than or equal to 530 msec in patients with QRS greater than or equal to 120 msec.\n* Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at screening (Visit 1) would be excluded:\n\n  * Myocardial infarction or unstable angina in the last 6 months\n  * Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the last 3 months\n  * New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure\n* Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction should only be included if in the opinion of the Investigator the benefit outweighs the risk and that the condition would not contraindicate study participation.\n* Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5 years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.\n* Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease, intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the validity of informed consent to participate in the study.\n* Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their salbutamol for the 6-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each study visit.\n* Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years.\n* Allergy or hypersensitivity: A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid, anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta-agonist, lactose/severe milk protein or magnesium stearate.\n* Tobacco use: Subjects who are: Current smokers (defined as subjects who have used inhaled tobacco products within the 12 months prior to Visit 1 \\[i.e., cigarettes, e-cigarettes/vaping, cigars or pipe tobacco\\]); Former smokers with a smoking history of greater than equal to 10 pack years (e.g., greater than equal to 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years).\n* Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study procedures.

Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6 at screening and ACQ-7 at the end of the run-in period) will be used for the assessment of control status of asthma, i.e., 0.75 points shows controlled and \\>0.75 shows not well controlled.\n* Concurrent conditions/medical history: Liver function test at Visit1\n\n  * ALT \\<2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * ALP less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN\n  * Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (isolated bilirubin \\>1.5 x ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin \\<35%)\n\nExclusion Criteria end of the run-in period (Visit 2)\n\n* Respiratory Infection: Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during the run-in period that led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n* Severe asthma exacerbation: Evidence of a severe exacerbation during screening or the run-in period, defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an in-patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids.\n* Laboratory test abnormalities: Evidence of clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests during screening or the run-in period which are still abnormal upon repeat analysis and are not believed to be due to disease(s) present. Each Investigator will use his/her own discretion in determining the clinical significance of the abnormality.\n* There is no restriction on diet in this study.\n* Use of tobacco products will not be allowed from screening until after the final follow-up visit.
