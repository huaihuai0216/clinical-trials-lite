Known prior hypersensitivity or allergy to the investigational product or its excipients.\n5. Treatment with insulin within 3 months prior to informed consent.\n6. Treatment with anti-obesity drugs (e.g., sibutramine, orlistat, rimonabant) within three months prior to informed consent or initiating therapy during the study.\n7.
