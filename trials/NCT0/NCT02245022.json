Moreover, women may acquire NNRTI resistance from primary transmission, or use of nevirapine (NVP) in previous pregnancies. In these circumstances, DTG is likely to be more effective in reducing mother to child transmission of HIV than NNRTI-based regimens.\n\nStudy design: HIV positive pregnant women presenting with untreated HIV infection in late (â‰¥28 -36 weeks gestation) pregnancy will be randomised 1:1 to receive DTG (50mg once daily) or standard of care (nevirapine or efavirenz) + 2 NRTIs. PK (0-24h) profile will be sampled in third trimester and post-partum.\n\nAlthough this is primarily a PK study (and has been powered as such) randomisation is included to allow comparison of plasma HIV VL responses against standard of care (NVP or EFV) and is essential for evaluation of secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy of DTG in pregnancy.\n\nNumber recruited N=30 per group","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"AUC0-24 of DTG in Pregnant Women in Third Trimester and 2 Weeks Postpartum","timeFrame":"In 3rd trimester and 2 weeks postpartum","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dolutegravir 50mg od","deltaMin":35322,"sd":null},{"arm":"Postpartum","deltaMin":40127,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["South Africa","Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33346335","31539371"],"seeAlso":["https://www.viivhealthcare.com/our-medicines/tivicay.aspx"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":29},"commonTop":["Low haemoglobin"]}}
