(Note: Subjects with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease 6 weeks before investigational product vaccination, are eligible.)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects with active AIDS related illness, including opportunistic infections or malignancy.\n* Evidence of current illicit substance and/or alcohol abuse, that in the investigator's opinion, precludes the subject from participating in the study or interferes with the evaluation of the study objectives..\n* Receipt of any licensed or experimental pneumococcal conjugate vaccine prior to enrollment.\n* Contraindication to vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.\n* Previous anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine or vaccine-related component.\n* History of culture-proven invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae within the last year.\n* Current anticoagulant therapy or a history of bleeding diathesis or any condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate intramuscular injection. (Note: Use of antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, is permitted.)\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding women, as defined by history or positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine test. All women of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test.\n* History of active hepatitis with elevation in pretreatment aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values \\>5 times the upper limit of normal within the last 6 months.\n* Serious chronic disorder or any other disorder that, in the investigator's opinion, precludes the subject from participating in the study or interferes with the evaluation of the study objectives. (Note: Serious chronic disorders include metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen, end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, and clinically unstable cardiac disease).\n* Any major illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and completion of, the study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's response.\n* History of splenectomy.\n* Receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin, within 42 days before investigational product vaccination until the last blood draw for the study (approximately 13 months after the first investigational product vaccination).\n* Evidence of dementia or other severe cognitive impairment.\n* Subject who is, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to receive a vaccination in the deltoid muscle of either arm because of insufficient muscle mass.\n* Participation in another study using investigational product from 28 days before study enrollment until the blood draw at visit 6. Between the blood draw at visit 6 and the 6 month follow-up telephone call (visit 7), use of investigational product must be discussed with the Medical Monitor. (Note: Participation in purely observational studies is acceptable.)\n* Residence in a nursing home, long-term care facility, or other institution or requirement of semi-skilled nursing care. An ambulatory resident of a retirement home or village is eligible for the trial.\n* Subject who is a direct relative (child, grandchild, parent, or grandparent) of study personnel, or who is study personnel.\n\nTemporary Delay Criteria:\n\n* Current febrile illness (oral temperature of =38.0°C \\[100.4°F\\]) or other acute illness within 48 hours before study vaccine administration.\n* Currently receiving antibiotic therapy, or has completed a course of antibiotic therapy within 10 days before study vaccine administration.\n* Receipt of novel influenza A (H1N1) vaccine within 14 days before investigational product vaccination (seasonal influenza vaccine can be given at any time at the discretion of the investigator).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) for Serotype-specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Antibody From 1 Month After Dose 2 of 13vPnC to 1 Month After Dose 3 of 13vPnC","description":"Geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) for the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) from 1 month post-dose 2 to 1 month post-dose 3 were computed using the logarithmically transformed assay results.
