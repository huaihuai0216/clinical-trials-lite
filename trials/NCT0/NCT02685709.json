Based on qualitative and quantitative studies conducted by the EuroQol Group, there are 5 levels under each domain: 'no problems' (assigned a value of 1), 'slight problems' (assigned a value of 2), 'moderate problems' (assigned a value of 3), 'severe problems' (assigned a value of 4), and 'unable to/extreme problems' (assigned a value of 5).
