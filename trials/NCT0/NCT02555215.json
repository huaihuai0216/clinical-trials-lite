Subjects will provide assent in addition to the parental or guardian consent, as appropriate, per local regulations.\n* Subjects who completed, as per protocol, the previous BG00012 clinical study 109MS202 (NCT02410200) and remain on BG00012 treatment.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements, including the presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the subject's ability to comply with the protocol.\n* Any significant changes in medical history occurring after enrollment in the parent Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200), including laboratory test abnormalities or current clinically significant conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would have excluded the subject's participation from the parent study. The Investigator must re-review the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any factors that would preclude treatment.\n* Subjects from Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200) who could not tolerate study treatment.\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"10 Years","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","description":"An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment.
