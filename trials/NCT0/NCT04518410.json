There is currently an urgent need for one study to efficiently test multiple drugs from more than one company, in people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but who do not currently need hospitalization. This could help prevent disease progression to more serious symptoms and complications, and spread of COVID-19 in the community.\n\nThis study looks at the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in treating COVID-19 in outpatients. In Phase II, participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug or with placebo. In protocol version 7.0, participants in Phase III of the study will be treated with either a study drug or active comparator drug. Participants assigned to the bamlanivimab agent/placebo arm and will have 28 days of intensive follow-up following study drug administration, followed by limited follow-up through 24 weeks in phase II and in phase III. All other investigational agents and their corresponding placebo arms will involve 28 days of intensive follow-up, followed by limited follow-up through 72 weeks in phase II and phase III. Additional study visits may be required, depending on the agent.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"COVID-19 Symptom Duration (Phase 2)","timeFrame":"Up to Day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bamlanivimab 7000mg (Phase 2)","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bamlanivimab 7000mg Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":18.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bamlanivimab 700mg (Phase 2)","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bamlanivimab 700mg Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":20.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"AZD7442 (IV) (Phase 2)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"AZD7442 (IV) Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"AZD7442 (IM) (Phase 2)","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"AZD7442 (IM) Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"SNG001 (Phase 2)","deltaMin":13,"sd":null},{"arm":"SNG001 Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Camostat (Phase 2)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Camostat Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"SAB-185 (Low Dose) (Phase 2)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"SAB-185 (Low Dose) Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"SAB-185 (High Dose) (Phase 2)","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"SAB-185 (High Dose) Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null},{"arm":"BMS 986414+BMS 986413 (Phase 2)","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"BMS 986414+BMS 986413 Pooled Placebo (Phase 2)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":17,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":252,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Guatemala","Mexico","Philippines","Puerto Rico","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37650231","37650237","37650234","37650235","35797235","35793677","35995785","36210483","36301549","36289399","36467293","36378539","37279602","36661240","37068272","37099295","36802755","37650232","37650230","37650236","37650233","37855026","39028902","39018444","35713300","34981077","34473343"],"seeAlso":["http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/default.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html","https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/participant-guide","https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/find-a-clinical-trial","https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials","https://www.niaid.nih.gov/","https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":48},"commonTop":["Headache","Blood glucose increased","COVID-19","Fatigue","Diarrhoea"]}}
