Participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms (atezolizumab in combination with enzalutamide, and enzalutamide alone) in a 1:1 ratio (experimental to control arm) in global randomized phase. Participants will receive treatment until investigator-assessed confirmed radiographic disease progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or unacceptable toxicity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Baseline until death from any cause (up to approximately 42 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Atezolizumab + Enzalutamide","deltaMin":15.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Enzalutamide","deltaMin":16.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0940"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2786"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":158,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","Czechia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35013615"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":139,"n":374},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Decreased appetite","Nausea","Asthenia","Arthralgia"]}}
