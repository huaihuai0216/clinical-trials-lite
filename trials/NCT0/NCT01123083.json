The study objective is to find out if an 8-day series of otelixizumab infusions leads to greater improvement in insulin secretion as compared with placebo. Insulin secretion will be assessed using mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide.\n\nSubjects will be assigned to receive either otelixizumab or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 (2/3 otelixizumab, 1/3 placebo). These study agents will be administered as an addition to insulin, diet, and other standard of care treatments.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in 2 Hour Mixed Meal-stimulated C-peptide Area Under Curve (AUC) (Normalized for 120-minute Time Interval) at Month 12","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day 1) and Month 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.14,"sd":0.036},{"arm":"Otelixizumab","deltaMin":-0.23,"sd":0.026}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.051"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15972866","20225393","19111162"],"seeAlso":["http://www.defendagainstdiabetes.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":61},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Fatigue","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
