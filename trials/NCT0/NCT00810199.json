Patients receiving methotrexate treatment will be randomized to receive either a) tocilizumab 8 mg intravenous (iv) every 4 weeks + methotrexate orally (po) weekly or b) tocilizumab 8 mg iv every 4 weeks + placebo po weekly. After the first 24 weeks of blinded treatment, treatment adjustments (increase or decrease of treatment intensity) may be introduced at intervals, based on response. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 3 years, and the target sample size is approximately 470 patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Disease Activity Score 28 Joints (DAS28) Remission at Week 24","timeFrame":"Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tocilizumab + Methotrexate","deltaMin":40.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab + Placebo","deltaMin":34.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2055"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1894"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":137,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Croatia","Denmark","Estonia","France","Germany","Greece","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Netherlands","Norway","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Sweden","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22562983","24473673","26037777","25169728"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":49,"n":277},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Hypercholesterolemia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Back pain","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
