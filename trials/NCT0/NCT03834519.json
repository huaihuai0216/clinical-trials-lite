Overall Survival (OS) and\n2. Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)\n\nAs of Amendment 06, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is no longer applicable. Participants still on treatment may have the option to continue receiving study intervention or SOC if they are deriving clinical benefit, until criteria for discontinuation are met. Participants who are still on study treatment and deriving clinical benefit will no longer have tumor response assessments by BICR. However, local tumor imaging assessments should continue per standard of care (SOC) schedule. In addition, electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments will no longer be performed and biomarker samples will no longer be collected.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to ~31 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab + Olaparib","deltaMin":15.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Next-generation Hormonal Agent Monotherapy (NHA)","deltaMin":14.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2616"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":193,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Brazil","Canada","Chile","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37290035","40685311"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/","https://www.trialsummaries.com/Study/StudyDetails?id=26344&tenant=MT_MSD_9011"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":179,"n":526},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Nausea","Fatigue","Decreased appetite","Constipation"]}}
