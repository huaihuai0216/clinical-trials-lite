In those cases, in absence of an alternative diagnosis, and with highly suspect bilateral ground glass opacities on recent (\\<24h) chest-CT scan (confirmed by a radiologist and pulmonary physician as probable COVID-19), and a typical clinical and chemical diagnosis with signs of cytokine release syndrome, a patient can be enrolled as probable COVID-19 infected. In all cases, this needs confirmation by later seroconversion.\n* Presence of hypoxia defined as PaO2/FiO2 below 350 while breathing room air in upright position or PaO2/FiO2 below 280 on supplemental oxygen and immediately requiring high flow oxygen device or mechanical ventilation\n* signs of cytokine release syndrome defined as ANY of the following:\n\n  1. serum ferritin concentration \\>1000 mcg/L and rising since last 24h\n  2. single ferritin above 2000 mcg/L in patients requiring immediate high flow oxygen device or mechanical ventilation\n  3. lymphopenia defined as \\<800 lymphocytes/microliter) and two of the following extra criteria\n\n     * Ferritin \\> 700 mcg/L and rising since last 24h\n     * increased LDH (above 300 IU/L) and rising last 24h\n     * D-Dimers \\> 1000 ng/mL and rising since last 24h\n     * CRP above 70mg/L and rising since last 24h and absence of bacterial infection\n     * if three of the above are present at admission, no need to document 24h rise\n* Chest X-ray or CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within last 2 days\n* Admitted to specialized COVID-19 ward or an ICU ward taking care of COVID-19 patients\n* Age ≥ 18yrs\n* Male or Female\n* Willing and able to provide informed consent or legal representative willing to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with known history of serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any of the study medications, or any component of the product.\n* mechanical ventilation \\> 24 h at Randomization\n* Patient on ECMO at time of screening\n* clinical frailty scale above 3 (This frailty score is the patient status before first symptoms of COVID-19 episode.)\n* active bacterial or fungal infection\n* unlikely to survive beyond 48h\n* neutrophil count below 1500 cells/microliter\n* platelets below 50.000/microliter\n* Patients enrolled in another investigational drug study\n* patients on high dose systemic steroids (\\> 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) for COVID-19 unrelated disorder\n* patients on immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drugs\n* patients on current anti-IL1 or anti-IL6 treatment\n* signs of active tuberculosis\n* serum transaminase levels \\>5 times upper limit of normal\n* bowel perforation or diverticulitis\n* pregnant or breastfeeding females (all female subjects deemed of childbearing potential by the investigator must have negative pregnancy test at screening)\n* Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test pre-dose on day 1.
