A diagnosis of MDD with psychotic features will be acceptable.\n* Diagnosis of MDD confirmed through a formal adjudication process.\n* Participant demonstrates ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.\n* Participant must have an inadequate response, as measured by the modified antidepressant treatment response questionnaire (ATRQ), to 1 to 3 antidepressants administered during the current episode at an adequate dose (as per package insert) and for at least 6 weeks duration, with at least one dose escalation during the current depressive episode.\n* Only one antidepressant (of sufficient dose per package insert and taken for at least 6 weeks) will be allowed at randomization and Participants must agree to continue taking the same ADT dosing regimen through completion of Visit 6/early termination (ET). Participants who are taking more than one antidepressant at Screening, regardless of the indication, will need to discontinue all other antidepressants prior to Visit 2 (Baseline).\n* Male and female Participants must agree to use a medically acceptable and highly effective method of birth control during the course of the entire study.\n* Women of childbearing potential (only) must have a negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test prior to Visit 2.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of any current psychiatric diagnosis other than MDD (including those with current intellectual development disability) with the exception of specific phobias.\n* Participant has a history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to cariprazine or other drugs of the same class or to rescue medications.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 6 in the MADRS (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) Total Score","description":"The MADRS is a 10-item, clinician-rated scale that evaluates the participant's depressive symptomatology during the past week.
