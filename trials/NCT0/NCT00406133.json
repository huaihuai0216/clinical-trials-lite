Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued from the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"8 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) From Baseline to 26 Weeks in the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and Control Groups (for the Cohort With Baseline HbA1c >=7.0% Cohort)","description":"The primary outcome was the Change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to 26 weeks, as determined by a central laboratory (for the cohort with baseline HbA1c \\>=7.0% cohort).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.37","spread":"0.90"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.22","spread":"0.54"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.18","spread":"0.65"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.21","spread":"0.61"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.50","spread":"0.56"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.02","spread":"0.45"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time With Glucose Level <=70 mg/dL (for the Cohort With Baseline HbA1c <7.0%)","description":"The primary outcome was the change in the time per day with glucose values \\<=70mg/dL comparing baseline sensor values with those obtained following the 26-week visit.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"54","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Severe Hypoglycemia (for the Cohort With Baseline HbA1c >=7.0% Cohort)","description":"Measure of the number of severe hypoglycemic events in the cohort with baseline HbA1c \\>=7.0% cohort","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Minutes Per Day Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Glucose Values 71-180 mg/dL (for the Cohort With Baseline HbA1c >=7.0% Cohort)","description":"Data regarding CGM were obtained after completion of the 26-week visit with the use of an unblinded device in the RT-CGM group and a blinded device in the Control group.
