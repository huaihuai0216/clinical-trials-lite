The primary outcome is change in HbA1c after 26 weeks. A parallel randomized trial is being conducted for a second cohort with HbA1c \\<7.0% that will follow an identical protocol to that of the first cohort with HbA1c \\>=7.0%.\n\nThe \\>=7.0% trial was specifically designed and statistically powered to compare separately the impact of continuous versus standard intensive glucose monitoring in the three age groups. Both trials used standardized treatment algorithms and equivalent frequent contacts with subjects in both the CGM and control group.\n\nAfter completion of the 26-week trial, the CGM group continues to use CGM for another 26 weeks to evaluate whether any beneficial effect seen in the first 6 months is sustained with longer-term use and less intensive contact and the control group initiates CGM use with less intensive contact after the first month than was provided at initiation of CGM use in the CGM group in the randomized trial.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) From Baseline to 26 Weeks in the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and Control Groups (for the Cohort With Baseline HbA1c >=7.0% Cohort)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 26 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Primary Cohort CGM Group","deltaMin":-0.37,"sd":0.9},{"arm":"Primary Cohort Control Group","deltaMin":-0.22,"sd":0.54}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.29"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.52"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":11,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18828243","18779236","19429875","21505208","21299401","21266651","21266647","20200306","19837791","19675206","19675193"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":165},"commonTop":["Cellulitis related to sensor use","Diabetic ketoacidosis","Dizziness during blood draw","Anxiety and depression","Kidney laceration"]}}
