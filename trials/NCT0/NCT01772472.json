Questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Obtained scores are linearly transformed to a score range of 0-100. High score for functional scale indicated high/better level of functioning/healthy functioning. Higher scores for symptom scales represent higher levels of symptoms/problems. For functional scales, positive change from baseline indicated deterioration in QOL and negative change from baseline indicated an improvement in QOL.
