As per protocol, analysis for this outcome measure used pooled data from 2 studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and PSA3002) because initial power assumptions showed that 900 participants would be required to evaluate impact of ustekinumab on structural damage (SD) progression. The 2 studies, (which had similar study designs and dosing regimens with difference to prior exposure to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) therapies), were intended to independently measure efficacy in terms of signs, symptoms and physical function, while effects on SD progression is provided from an integrated analysis.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.97","spread":"3.852"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":"2.110"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.39","spread":"2.403"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.40","spread":"2.260"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":205},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection","Hypertension","Psoriatic Arthropathy","Urinary Tract Infection"]}}}
