The SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 domains (consisting of 2 components; physical and mental) of functional health and well-being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role (role-physical, role-emotional) limitations, bodily pain, general health (GH), vitality, mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled from 0 (worst level of functioning) to 100 (100=best level of functioning). The least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline was determined by Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and presented for each of the eight health scale.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"1.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.1","spread":"0.99"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":"1.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.9","spread":"1.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.7","spread":"0.98"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.1","spread":"0.96"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":"1.07"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.4","spread":"1.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.5","spread":"1.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.1","spread":"1.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.5","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.5","spread":"1.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.6","spread":"2.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.5","spread":"2.20"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.3","spread":"2.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-7.3","spread":"2.47"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":"1.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.0","spread":"1.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.1","spread":"1.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.0","spread":"1.37"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.9","spread":"0.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.6","spread":"0.95"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.8","spread":"1.10"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.0","spread":"1.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.2","spread":"1.37"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.1","spread":"1.35"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.0","spread":"1.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.2","spread":"1.46"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.4","spread":"2.17"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.3","spread":"2.14"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.1","spread":"2.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.2","spread":"2.42"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants on Blood Pressure/Anti-Hypertensive Treatment According to Class Of Drugs","description":"Anti-hypertensive is defined as class of drugs that are used to treat hypertension.
