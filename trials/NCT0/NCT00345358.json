The immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal conjugate vaccine will be evaluated for four different age groups with different schedules:\n\n\\< 6 months of age group: 3-dose primary vaccination + a booster dose. 7 to 11 months of age group: 2-dose primary vaccination + a booster dose. 12 to 23 months of age group: 2-dose vaccination; no booster dose. 24 months to 5 years of age group: 1-dose vaccination; no booster dose. Children below 6 months of age will receive concomitantly a DTPa-IPV/Hib vaccine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Anti-pneumococcal Serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F Antibody Concentrations >= 0.20 Microgram Per Milliliter (µg/mL).
