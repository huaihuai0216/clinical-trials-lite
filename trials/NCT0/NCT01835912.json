Studies have confirmed that increasing extracellular pH promotes the efflux of La- and H+ from active muscles. This is due to an increase in activity of the pH sensitive monocarboxylate transporter as the gradient of intracellular versus extracellular H+ increases. Therefore, artificially inducing alkalosis prior to anaerobic exercise may reduce intracellular acidosis and increase the time to fatigue - defined as a decrease in force production with an increased perception of effort. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that sodium citrate ingestion (chronic and acute) will not have an effect on exercise performance compared to placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time","timeFrame":"once each 200m performance","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Flavoured Water Placebo for Acute Dosing","deltaMin":144.2,"sd":4.7},{"arm":"Sodium Citrate Dihydrate Acute","deltaMin":145.3,"sd":5.3},{"arm":"Flavoured Water Placebo for Chronic Dosing","deltaMin":145.3,"sd":5.4},{"arm":"Sodium Citrate Dihydrate Chronic","deltaMin":144.8,"sd":5.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24944546"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
