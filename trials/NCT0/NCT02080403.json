The primary efficacy measure will be the reduction in probing pocket depth at 6 months as measured at sites of qualifying target implant.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Absolute Change in Mean Probing Pocket Depth for Selected Target Implants","timeFrame":"Baseline to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment","deltaMin":-1.69,"sd":1.18},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":-1.51,"sd":1.16}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1159"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States","Germany","Israel","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":146},"commonTop":["Implant site pain","Nasopharyngitis","Post procedural discomfort","Tooth repair","Toothache"]}}
