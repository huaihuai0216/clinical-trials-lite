The sIFA consists of 11 items scored on an 11 point numerical rating scale from 0 (no difficulty) to 10 (unable to do) across 3 domains: upper body functioning, lower body functioning and general functioning. Participants completed the assessment where the recall period was the past week prior to completing the patient reported outcome (PRO).
