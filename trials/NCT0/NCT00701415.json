If the leukocyte αGAL activity assay was difficult to obtain, the participant might be enrolled based on documented plasma αGAL \\<1.5 nmol/hr/mL, with the agreement of the Medical Monitor (resulted from a central laboratory).\n* The participant must had evidence of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) accumulation as documented by plasma GL-3 (\\>7.0 µg/mL) or urinary GL-3 (\\>0.3 mg GL-3/mmol creatinine) levels (results from a central laboratory).\n* The participant must be male ≥5 and ≤18 years of age.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participant had albuminuria (first morning void urinary albumin/creatinine ratio \\>30 mg/g on at least 2 out of 3 consecutive samples, each at least 1 week apart).\n* Participant had a Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) by iohexol \\<90 L/min/1.73m\\^2. In case of properly documented low protein intake, values as low as 80 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 might be acceptable, after consultation with the Medical Monitor.\n* Participant had documented evidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or if a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had been performed, bright lesions \\>2 mm on T2- or fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)- weighted images within the white matter or the basal ganglia.\n* Participant had severe and recurrent acroparesthesia, judged by the physician as frequent (more than once a week) pain episodes for at least 3 months that influenced daily activities, irrespective of medication.\n* Participant had an end-diastolic left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWTd) and/or an end-diastolic interventricular septum thickness (IVSTd)≥2 standard deviations (SD) compared to normal (based on body surface area \\[BSA\\] normal ranges from Kampmann, et al 2000) as read at the study site.\n* Participant had received prior treatment specific to Fabry Disease.\n* Participant had participated in a study employing an investigational drug within 30 days of the start of their participation in this study.\n* Participant had any medical condition or extenuating circumstance, which in the opinion of the Study Investigator, could interfere with study compliance.\n* Participant had any medical condition or extenuating circumstance, for example diabetes mellitus, which in the opinion of the Study Investigator, could interfere with the interpretation of study results.\n* Participant was on treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs).\n* Participant had any contra-indication mentioned in the labeling of Fabrazyme and/or iohexol (Omnipaque).\n* Participant or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) was unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"5 Years","maximumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Skin Globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) Clearance From Superficial Skin Capillary Endothelium","description":"Skin biopsies were taken at Baseline, Week 52, Week 156 and Week 260 or early withdrawal and analyzed for cellular GL-3 accumulation (inclusions) by light microscopy.
