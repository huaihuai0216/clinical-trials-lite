Note: Subjects on a b.i.d regimen of seroquel IR for 7 days prior to enrolment are eligible to participate in the study.\n* Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at enrolment and be willing to use a reliable method of birth control, ie, barrier method, oral contraceptive, implant, dermal contraception, long-term injectable contraceptive, intrauterine device, or tubal ligation during the study.\n* Capable to make treatment decisions, including being able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and judged as such by the Principal Investigator.\n* Be able to read and write either English or French at a grade 7 proficiency level.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* First episode, drug naive schizophrenic subjects.\n* Meeting the criteria for any other (than schizophrenia) DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis, concomitant organic mental disorder or mental retardation that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator may interfere with study conduct or interpretation.\n* Substance/alcohol dependence or abuse at enrolment \\[except dependence in full remission (\\>3 months) and except caffeine and nicotine dependence\\] as defined by DSM-IV criteria. A urine drug screen will be performed. The Principal Investigator will evaluate the results along with medical history to determine if the patient meets DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse or dependence. However, a single urine toxicology screen for cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine or PCP will lead to exclusion.\n* Subjects requiring treatment with another antipsychotic agent than investigational product during study.\n* Subjects on seroquel IR once daily.\n* Known lack of response to clozapine or treatment with clozapine within 4 weeks prior to enrolment.\n* Known intolerance to seroquel IR.\n* Subjects requiring treatment with disallowed medication following enrolment into the study.\n* Subjects requiring treatment for epilepsy.\n* Subjects who pose an imminent risk of suicide or danger to themselves or others, as judged by the Principal Investigator.\n* Pregnancy or lactation.\n* A thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration more than 10% above the upper limit of the normal range of the laboratory used for sample analysis whether or not the patient is being treated for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.\n* Use of a depot or long-acting injectable antipsychotic drug within 1 dosing interval before Day 1 of treatment or during treatment.\n* Use of drugs that induce or inhibit the hepatic metabolising cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes within 14 days of the screening assessment period (Day -7 to 0). See Table 5.\n* History of idiopathic or drug-induced agranulocytosis.\n* A QTc interval longer than 450 msec (calculated using the Fridericia correction for heart rate) or ECG considered to show cardiac abnormality at enrolment as determined by a centrally located, experienced cardiologist, and confirmed by the Principal Investigator as clinically significant.\n* Evidence of clinically relevant disease (eg, renal, hepatic, autonomic, endocrine, hematologic or ophthalmologic impairment, significant coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, viral hepatitis B or C, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \\[AIDS\\] or cancer) or a clinical finding that is unstable or that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would be negatively affected by the investigational product or that would affect the investigational product.\n* Laboratory test results outside the reference range considered by the Principal Investigator to be clinically significant and potentially interfere with the study outcome.\n* A patient with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) fulfilling one of the following criteria:\n\n  * Unstable DM defined as HbA1c \\>8.5% at enrolment. Admitted to hospital for treatment of DM or DM related illness in past 12 weeks.\n  * Not under care of physician responsible for patient's DM care.\n  * Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not indicated that patient's DM is controlled.\n  * Physician responsible for patient's DM care has not approved patient's participation in the study.\n  * Has not been on the same dose of oral hypoglycemic drug(s) and/or diet for the four (4) weeks prior to randomisation. For thiazolidinediones (glitazones) this period should not be less than 8 weeks.\n  * Taking insulin whose daily dose on one occasion in the past 4 weeks has been more than 10% above or below their mean dose in the preceding 4 weeks.\n\nNote: If a diabetic patient meets one of these criteria the patient is to be excluded even if the treating physician believes the patient is stable and can participate in the study.\n\n* An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of \\<1.5 x 109/L\n* Inability to accommodate the visit schedule.\n* History of non-compliance as judged by the Principal Investigator.\n* Previous enrolment in the present study.\n* Participation in another clinical study or compassionate use programme within 4 weeks of screening (Day -7 to 0).\n* Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca staff or staff at the study site).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Subjects With Improved Clinical Benefit From Assessment of Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit (CGI-CB) Scale From Baseline to Week 24 or End of Study","description":"Proportional change in CGI-CB score The CGI-CB scale is used to evaluate investigator's global weighted impression of efficacy and interference of adverse events (AEs) from enrolment to every visit.
