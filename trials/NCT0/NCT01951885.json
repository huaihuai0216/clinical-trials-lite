Both mycophenolate mofetil and reduced-dose methotrexate, in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, have been shown to be safe and effective in GVHD prevention with less toxicity than standard dose methotrexate. It is not yet known, however, whether this combination of mycophenolate mofetil and reduced-dose methotrexate with tacrolimus is more effective than tacrolimus and standard dose methotrexate in preventing GVHD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Severe (Grade 3-4) Mucositis Graded According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Grading Scale","timeFrame":"Up to day 28","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A (Tacrolimus, Methotrexate)","deltaMin":81.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group B (Tacrolimus, Methotrexate, Mycophenolate Mofetil)","deltaMin":57.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37352262"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":50},"commonTop":["nausea","diarrhea","vomiting","FATIGUE","hypomagnesemia"]}}
