An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severe AE=prevents normal daily activities.

Serious AEs: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A treatment-emergent AE was defined as an AE that began after the first administration of study medication or existing AEs that worsened after the first dose of study medication.
