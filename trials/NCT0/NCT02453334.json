Criteria:\n\n* Previous participation in a ferric carboxymaltose clinical trial.\n* Known hypersensitivity reaction to any component of ferric carboxymaltose.\n* Subjects with overt bleeding\n* Any anemia treatment within 4 weeks before inclusion (oral iron, IV iron, transfusion, or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents).\n* Subjects on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.\n* Requiring dialysis for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.\n* Any non-viral infection.\n* Known positive hepatitis with evidence of active disease.\n* Received an investigational drug within 30 days of screening.\n* Alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months.\n* Hemochromatosis or other iron storage disorders.\n* Any other laboratory abnormality, medical condition or psychiatric disorders which in the opinion of the Investigator would put the subject's disease management at risk or may result in the subject being unable to comply with study requirements.\n* Pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant
