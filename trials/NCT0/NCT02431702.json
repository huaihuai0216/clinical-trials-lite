Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none; 1=equivocal; 2=present, but mild; 3=present and moderate; and 4=present and severe). Total Score is taken as summation. A higher score indicates a more severe condition. Worsened or improved is defined as increase or decrease compared to baseline.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"22","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"40","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"39","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Part 3 (EDP): Change From Baseline in Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) Score","description":"The Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) is a 7-point, verbally administered, Likert-type scale rated as follows: 1=Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Somewhat Dissatisfied, 4=Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied, 5=Somewhat Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7=Extremely Satisfied.

The volume of myelinated brain tissue is measured separately on co-localized IR and proton density (PD) MRI images, by outlining the boundary between gray matter and white matter on each image. 2. ICM is calculated from the difference of \"IR volume minus PD volume\". 3. ICM is then expressed as a fraction of the total intracranial volume (ICM divided by intracranial volume). 4. The ICM fraction is then adjusted for effects of age, gender, and race/ethnicity in the sample of treated participants and healthy controls. A decrease in the adjusted ICM fraction score may be a sign of disease progression.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.7","spread":"1.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.2","spread":"0.95"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.5","spread":"0.96"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":273},"commonTop":["Weight Increased","Headache","Insomnia","Somnolence","Nausea"]}}}
