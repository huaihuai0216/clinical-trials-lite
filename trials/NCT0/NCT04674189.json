A follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level may be measured at the discretion of the investigator to confirm postmenopausal status.\n* Females of childbearing potential: negative urine pregnancy test (human chorionic gonadotropin within 24 hours prior to each trial vaccination on Day 1 and Day 29.\n* Females of childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of birth control from 2 weeks before the first administration of the trial vaccine until 3 months following the last administration. The following methods of birth control are considered highly effective when used consistently and correctly:\n\n  * Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal);\n  * Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable or implantable);\n  * Intrauterine devices (IUDs);\n  * Intrauterine hormone-releasing systems (IUSs);\n  * Bilateral tubal ligation;\n  * Vasectomized partner;\n  * Sexual abstinence (periodic abstinence \\[e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal and post-ovulation methods\\] and withdrawal are not acceptable).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 positive serology.\n* For females: pregnancy or lactation.\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (vaccine or drug) within 28 days preceding the administration of the first trial vaccine or planned use during the trial.\n* Receipt of licensed vaccines within 28 days (for live vaccines) or 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) prior to the administration of trial vaccine.\n* Prior administration of any investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or other coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) vaccine or planned use during the trial.\n* Any treatment with immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs (including but not limited to corticosteroids, biologicals and methotrexate) for \\> 14 days total within 6 months preceding the administration of trial vaccine or planned use during the trial.

The use of inhaled, topical, or localized injections of corticosteroids (e.g., for joint pain/inflammation) is permitted.\n* Any medically diagnosed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on medical history and physical examination including known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), current diagnosis of or treatment for cancer including leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma or generalized malignancy; chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; and receipt of an organ or bone marrow transplant.\n* Active or chronic disease of, or currently on treatment for, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n* History of angioedema (hereditary or idiopathic), or a history of any anaphylactic reaction.\n* History of Potential immune-mediated disease (pIMD).\n* History of allergy to any component of CVnCoV vaccine.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins or any blood products within 3 months prior to the administration of trial vaccine, or planned receipt during the trial.\n* Participants with a significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes trial participation (e.g., may increase the risk of trial participation, render the participant unable to meet the requirements of the trial, or may interfere with the participant's trial evaluations). These include severe and/or un-controlled cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disorder, and neurological and psychiatric illnesses.\n* Participants with impaired coagulation or any bleeding disorder in whom an intramuscular (IM) injection or a blood draw is contraindicated.
