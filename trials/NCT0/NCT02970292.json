Patient has a psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia\n2. Patient has a history of resistance to antipsychotic treatment\n3. A urine drug screen (UDS) result at Baseline that indicates the presence of any tested prohibited substance of potential abuse, except marijuana\n\n   a. Patients with a result indicating the presence of marijuana are permitted if they agree to abstain from marijuana use during the study and the medical monitor approves the subject's participation\n4. Patient has current evidence of a serious and/or unstable psychiatric, neurologic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematologic, or other medical disorder, including cancer or malignancies, which would affect the patient's ability to participate in the program\n5. Patient has had a myocardial infarction in the last six months\n6. Patient is taking a medication or drug that prolongs the QT interval or has a family or personal history or symptoms of long QT syndrome\n\nPatients will be evaluated at screening to ensure that all criteria for study participation are met.
