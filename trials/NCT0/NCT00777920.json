The available ambrisentan doses for this study are 2.5, 5, or 10 mg administered orally once daily. Investigators will be able to adjust ambrisentan dose as clinically indicated. A minimum of 4 weeks between dose adjustments is required. Participants receiving other therapies for pulmonary hypertension that are not contraindicated for concomitant use with ambrisentan are permitted to enroll in this study and continue to receive such therapies. Participants enrolled in this study will receive treatment with ambrisentan until such time as the investigator or participant chooses to stop ambrisentan treatment, ambrisentan becomes commercially available, or the sponsor stops the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) Associated With Long-Term Exposure to Ambrisentan","timeFrame":"First dose date of study drug up to the date of last dose plus 30 days (Maximum: approximately 550 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ambrisentan","deltaMin":90.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":46,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Mexico","Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":80,"n":140},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Upper respiratory tract infection","Dyspnoea","Headache","Palpitations"]}}
