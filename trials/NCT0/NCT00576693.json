Age ≥ 30 years and ≤ 80 years.\n\n   • Patients 30-49 years are required to meet at least one additional criteria (i-vi) provided in the table below to qualify for the study. This additional requirement is to increase the likelihood that the symptomatic intracranial stenosis in patients 30-49 years is atherosclerotic.\n\n   i. insulin dependent diabetes for at least 15 years ii. at least 2 of the following atherosclerotic risk factors: hypertension (BP \\> 140/90 or on antihypertensive therapy); dyslipidemia (LDL \\> 130 mg /dl or HDL \\< 40 mg/dl or fasting triglycerides \\> 150 mg/dl or on lipid lowering therapy); smoking; non-insulin dependent diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes of less than 15 years duration; family history of any of the following: myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, coronary angioplasty or stenting, stroke, carotid endarterectomy or stenting, peripheral vascular surgery in parent or sibling who was \\< 55 years of age for men or \\< 65 for women at the time of the event ii. history of any of the following: myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass, coronary angioplasty or stenting, carotid endarterectomy or stenting, or peripheral vascular surgery for atherosclerotic disease iv. any stenosis of an extracranial carotid or vertebral artery, another intracranial artery, subclavian artery, coronary artery, iliac or femoral artery, other lower or upper extremity artery, mesenteric artery, or renal artery that was documented by non-invasive vascular imaging or catheter angiography and is considered atherosclerotic v. aortic arch atheroma documented by non-invasive vascular imaging or catheter angiography vi. any aortic aneurysm documented by non-invasive vascular imaging or catheter angiography that is considered atherosclerotic\n6. Negative pregnancy test in a female who has had any menses in the last 18 months\n7. Patient is willing and able to return for all follow-up visits required by the protocol\n8.

Tandem extracranial or intracranial stenosis (70%-99%) or occlusion that is proximal or distal to the target intracranial lesion (NOTE: an exception is allowed if the occlusion involves a single vertebral artery proximal to a symptomatic basilar artery stenosis and the contralateral vertebral artery is supplying the basilar artery)\n2. Bilateral intracranial vertebral artery stenosis of 70%-99% and uncertainty about which artery is symptomatic (e.g. if patient has pontine, midbrain, or temporal - occipital symptoms)\n3. Stenting, angioplasty, or endarterectomy of an extracranial (carotid or vertebral artery) or intracranial artery within 30 days prior to expected enrollment date\n4. Previous treatment of target lesion with a stent, angioplasty, or other mechanical device, or plan to perform staged angioplasty followed by stenting of target lesion\n5. Plan to perform concomitant angioplasty or stenting of an extracranial vessel tandem to an intracranial stenosis\n6. Presence of intraluminal thrombus proximal to or at the target lesion\n7.
