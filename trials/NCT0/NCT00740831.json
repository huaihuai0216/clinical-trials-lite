Monthly scores range from 0 (amenorrhea) to more than 500, with higher numbers indicating more bleeding.\n\nA slightly stained tampon/towel scores 1, a partially stained tampon/towel scores 5, a completely saturated tampon scores 10 and a completely saturated towel scores 20. Small clots/flooding (2cm) score 1. Large clots/flooding (3cm) score 5.\n\nMenorrhagia is defined as a PBAC \\> 100 during one menstrual period which approximates to a blood loss of \\> 80 mL. A PBAC of 400 corresponds to a blood loss of around 300 mL or approximately 80 tampons/towels used.\n\nThe week 13 PBAC score was calculated using the last 28 days of treatment.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"90.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"97.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"89.1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in the Total Volume of the Three Largest Myomas From Baseline to Week 13","description":"Assessment of PGL4001 capacity to decrease volume of the three largest myomas was performed at each center by means of ultrasonography at baseline and at week 13.\n\nThe total volume of the three largest myomas assessed at screening and at end-of-treatment visit (Week 13) was analysed on a logarithm transformed scale (to base 10).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.179","spread":"0.037"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.220","spread":"0.036"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.268","spread":"0.037"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Co-primary Safety Endpoint: Serum Estradiol Levels at End of Treatment Visit (Week 13 Visit) for PGL4001 Compared With GnRHagonist","description":"Measured by log 10 (log pg/ml) transformed values for estradiol (E2) in blood samples","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.897","spread":"0.041"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.843","spread":"0.041"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.381","spread":"0.041"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Co-primary Safety Endpoint: % of Subjects Reporting Moderate or Severe Hot Flushes as Adverse Events Throughout the Treatment Period for PGL4001 Compared With GnRH-agonist","description":"Difference in percentage of subjects reporting moderate or severe hot flushes:\n\nFrequency and severity of this adverse event(as spontaneously reported by patients or elicited by nonleading questions) were recorded on standard forms at every visit up to week 17.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"39.6","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":97},"commonTop":["Reproductive system and breast disorders","Hot flush","Nervous system disorders","Headache","Gastrointestinal disorders"]}}}
