Aerosol delivery of antibiotics directly to the lung increases the local concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection resulting in improved antimicrobial effects compared to systemic administration. Bacterial resistance to current aerosol antibiotic treatments indicate a need for improved therapies to treat CF patients with pulmonary infections caused by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria. High concentrations of MP-376 delivered directly to the lung are projected to have antimicrobial effects on even the most resistant organisms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"From start of study until end of the study (up to 168 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tobramycin Inhalation Solution 300 mg","deltaMin":90,"sd":null},{"arm":"Levofloxacin Inhalation Solution 240 mg","deltaMin":180,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":130,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Ireland","Israel","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26935334"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":90},"commonTop":["Disease progression","Cough","Sputum increased","Respiratory tract congestion","Weight decreased"]}}
