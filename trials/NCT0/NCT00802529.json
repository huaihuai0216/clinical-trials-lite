There should be normal, age appropriate hearing in the contralateral ear.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with Ménière's disease in later stages (not having vertigo attacks).\n* Age: patients older than 70 years at the start of the trial.\n* Severe disability (e.g. neurological, orthopaedic, cardiovascular) or serious concurrent illness that might interfere with treatment or follow up.\n* Active additional neuro-otological disorders that may mimic Ménière's disease (e.g. vestibular migraine, vertebro-basilar TIAs, acoustic neuroma) and thus will make the objective follow up difficult.\n* Concurrent ear pathology that may interfere with transtympanic treatment (e.g. active middle ear disease).\n* Family history of unexplained deafness (possibility of genetic susceptibility to gentamicin toxicity).\n* History of known adverse/allergic reaction to steroids or gentamicin.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Vertigo Attacks","description":"The number of vertigo attacks between 18-24months follow-up were taken retrospectively during a face-to-face appointment at 24 months follow-up and compared to 6 month pre-enrollment baseline (as per Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium guidelines).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.4","spread":"12.45"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19.93","spread":"16.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.6","spread":"3.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.5","spread":"5.8"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Hearing","description":"Hearing was measured as ipsilesional pure-tone threshold at Baseline, 1month, 2months, 6months, 12month, 18months and 24 months follow-up.

The formula for masking level was: low-frequency pure-tone threshold in ipsilesional ear - bone conduction mean threshold (0·5, 1 and 2KHz) in contralesional ear - 40dB. Speech loudness and masking were rounded to the nearest 5dB. Step increments and decrements of 10dB for speech loudness and masking were used to attain the maximum speech discrimination score.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"64.97","spread":"29.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"72.10","spread":"21.67"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"71.78","spread":"26.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"69.43","spread":"22.94"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.10","spread":"24.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"74.31","spread":"23.4"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"75.63","spread":"26.39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"76.35","spread":"25.92"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"73.43","spread":"27.16"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"71.58","spread":"24.69"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.32","spread":"29.36"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"64.99","spread":"30.75"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":["Otitis media","Retinoschisis","Scwannoma","Cist"]}}}
