Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy alone is as effective as chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in treating germ cell tumor.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy alone to see how well it works compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS germ cell tumor.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival","timeFrame":"Study enrollment until date of earliest qualifying event (QE), date last known to be QE-free if the patient is followed for less than three years and is QE-free at the time of analysis, or 3 years if the patient is QE-free at 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regimen A (Radiotherapy Only)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Regimen B (Chemotherapy Plus Radiotherapy)","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":107,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Lymphocyte count decreased","Platelet count decreased","White blood cell decreased","Hypokalemia"]}}
