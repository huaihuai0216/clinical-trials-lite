bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy\n* Known allergy or intolerance to any of the study medications\n* Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Previous organ transplantation including engrafted bone marrow transplant\n* Any other concomitant liver disease, including hemochromatosis, hepatitis C or D; Participants with severe steatohepatitis will be excluded (participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \\[NAFLD\\] with steatosis only and/or mild to moderate steatohepatitis are acceptable)\n* Positive anti-HIV\n* Renal insufficiency with calculated (by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method) creatinine clearance \\<60 mL/min within 8 weeks prior to randomization\n* Platelet count \\<90,000 /mm3, hemoglobin \\<13 g/dL (males) or \\<12 g/dL (females), absolute

psychiatric condition(s), including but not limited to: Current moderate or severe depression as determined by the study physician, history of depression requiring hospitalization within past 10 years, history of suicidal or homicidal attempt within the past 10 years, or history of severe psychiatric disorders including but not limited to schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder\n* History of immune-mediated disease, or cerebrovascular, chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease associated with functional limitation, retinopathy, uncontrolled thyroid disease, poorly controlled diabetes or uncontrolled seizure disorder\n* Any medical condition that would be predicted to be exacerbated by therapy or that would limit study participation\n* Any medical condition requiring or likely to require chronic systemic administration of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications during the course of this study\n* Evidence of active or suspected malignancy, or a history of malignancy within the last 144 weeks (except adequately treated carcinoma in situ or basal cell carcinoma of the skin)\n* Need for ongoing use of any antivirals with activity against HBV during the course of the study\n* Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would make the participant unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the participant participating in and completing the study.\n* Participation in any other clinical trial involving investigational drugs within 30 days of randomization or intention to participate in another clinical trial during this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
