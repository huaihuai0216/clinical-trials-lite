Baseline value is the average of the values from screening, randomization and immediately pre-dose.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.721","spread":"1.0477"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.231","spread":"1.2924"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.264","spread":"0.8979"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.822","spread":"1.0244"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.051","spread":"1.1860"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.651","spread":"0.9756"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.145","spread":"1.4052"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.515","spread":"0.8209"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.611","spread":"0.9732"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.655","spread":"1.1364"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.530","spread":"1.2694"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-2.109","spread":"1.3495"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.642","spread":"0.9282"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.544","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.169","spread":"2.1350"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.745","spread":"1.2354"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.290","spread":"1.2978"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.249","spread":"0.8727"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.678","spread":"1.2115"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.899","spread":"1.1966"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.594","spread":"0.9454"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.207","spread":"1.3866"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.565","spread":"0.8734"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.591","spread":"0.9309"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.448","spread":"1.2477"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.426","spread":"1.2977"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.942","spread":"1.4167"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.795","spread":"0.5079"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.833","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.105","spread":"2.0447"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":40,"n":182},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Headache","Fatigue","Nasopharyngitis"]}}}
