Several clinical studies also suggest that CIFN has greater antiviral activity in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C infection, particularly if given as a daily injection. These data indicate that the use of a regimen of daily CIFN and ribavirin will lead to greater virologic response rates compared with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 infection, with comparable adverse events. Emerging data indicate that HCV genotype 1 patients with a delayed virologic response to initial therapy may benefit from an extended duration of therapy. Therefore, the goals of this pilot study are to determine the tolerability and efficacy of daily CIFN plus ribavirin when given for 52 weeks or an extended duration of therapy. The target population will consist of \"difficult-to-treat\" patients, defined as having the following characteristics: genotype 1, a North American patient population, predominantly male gender, and no specific exclusions for pre-existing psychiatric or substance abuse co-morbidities.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Primary Endpoint Would be the Number Who Achieve a Sustained Virologic Response.","timeFrame":"24 weeks after the end of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"A (52 Weeks Treatment)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"B (Duration Based on Viral Response)","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["21221804"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":64},"commonTop":["other intolerable side effects","depression/anxiety","cellulitis"]}}
