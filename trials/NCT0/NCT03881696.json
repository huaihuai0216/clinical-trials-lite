While each participant may be allergic to more than two other foods, the primary endpoint/outcome in this study will only be assessed in peanut and two other foods for each participant. The primary objective of the study is to compare the ability to consume foods without dose-limiting symptoms during a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), after treatment with either omalizumab or placebo for omalizumab.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants by Stage 1 Treatment Assignment, Omalizumab Versus Placebo, Who Successfully Consume a Single Dose of ≥600 mg of Peanut Protein Without Dose-Limiting Symptoms During the DBPCFC Conducted at the End of Treatment Stage 1","timeFrame":"During the DBPCFC at the end of Stage 1: 16 to 20 weeks after Stage 1 treatment initiation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Omalizumab","deltaMin":79,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo for Omalizumab","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.00001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30586557","38407394"],"seeAlso":["http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/dait","http://www.niaid.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":120},"commonTop":["Hypersensitivity","Injection site reaction","Corona virus infection","Pyrexia","Diarrhoea"]}}
