The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a stannous fluoride dentifrice in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity compared to a marketed (negative) control, over a period of 56 days (8 weeks) with twice daily brushing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score","timeFrame":"Baseline-Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control Dentrifice (0.76% Sodium Monofluorophosphate)","deltaMin":2.26,"sd":0.379},{"arm":"Test Dentrifice (0.454% Stannous Fluoride)","deltaMin":2.25,"sd":0.355}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26437498"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":["Dysgeusia","Mouth Injury","Influenza"]}}
