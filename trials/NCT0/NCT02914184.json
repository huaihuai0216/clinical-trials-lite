For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent).

The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral cavity, the axilla and the rectum.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Weeks","maximumAge":"12 Weeks","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Anti-Rota Virus (Anti-RV) Immunoglobulin A (IgA) Antibody Concentrations in the Human Rotavirus (HRV) Liquid Formulation Groups (Liq_A, Liq_B and Liq_C)","description":"Antibody concentrations against Rota Virus (RV) were determined as Geometric Mean Antibody Concentration (GMC) and expressed as Units per milliliter (U/mL).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"155.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"147.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"175.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Seroconverted Subjects With RV Antibody Concentrations Above or Equal to Cut-off Value in Porcine Circovirus (PCV) -Free Liquid HRV Vaccine (Pooled HRV Liquid Group) and Control Group","description":"Seroconversion rate (SCR) was defined as the percentage of subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e., with anti-RV IgA antibody concentration less than (\\<) 20 U/mL before the first dose of HRV vaccine) and developed anti-RV IgA antibody concentration greater than or equal to (≥) 20 U/mL at Month 2-4 (1-2 months after dose 2).
