Lenalidomide may help shrink or slow the growth of multiple myeloma. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide and ixazomib together may work better than giving lenalidomide alone in treating patients with evidence of residual multiple myeloma after a stem cell transplantation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Assessed every 3 months if patient is <2 years from randomization, every 6 months if patient is 2-5 years from randomization, annually if patient is 5 years or more from randomization.","effectByArm":[],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":19,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":222,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
