Significant enlargement of the liver or spleen is evidence of progression. A significant increase in size is defined as \\> 2.0 cm in distance between costal margin and the inferior margin of either organ.\n\nRelapse is defined as the re-appearance of any clinical evidence of Hodgkin's disease in a patient who has had a complete response.
