A key secondary aim is to evaluate the antidepressant effectiveness of EPA in overweight adult outpatients with current major depressive disorder (MDD). To address these aims, the project will use a four-arm, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled design comparing placebo versus three doses of EPA (1 gm/day, 2 gm/day, or 4 gm/day) administered over 12 weeks. The study is to be conducted at two sites: Emory University School of Medicine, and Massachusetts General Hospital. Eligible participants will be between the ages of 18-80 who have current MDD, are overweight, and who demonstrate peripheral inflammation, defined as an high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level ≥ 3 mg/L. The primary outcome will be change in plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and/or mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) expression levels in EPA- versus placebo-treated participants. The results of this investigation are intended to be used to design and power a larger definitive test of the efficacy and biological effects of EPA in patients with major depressive disorder.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Plasma Concentration of Inflammatory Biomarkers IL-6 (pg/mL) and PBMC TNF-α (pg/mL)","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.92,"sd":30.24},{"arm":"EPA 1 g/Day","deltaMin":-1.27,"sd":28.37},{"arm":"EPA 2 g/Day","deltaMin":7.19,"sd":32.24},{"arm":"EPA 4 g/Day","deltaMin":4.45,"sd":40.16}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.10"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25272149","25802980","36005883","34817851"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Infection","Gastric reflux","Diarrhea/Loose stool","Constipation","Headache"]}}
