There will be ten enrolling sites in Denmark. 492 adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest receiving at least one dose of adrenaline will be enrolled. The primary outcome is return of spontaneous circulation and key secondary outcomes include survival at 30 days and survival at 30 days with a favorable neurological outcome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Return of Spontaneous Circulation","timeFrame":"During the cardiac arrest, an average of 20 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vasopressin and Methylprednisolone","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":86,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["Denmark"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34587236","34223347"],"seeAlso":["https://www.vam-ihca.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":237},"commonTop":[]}}
