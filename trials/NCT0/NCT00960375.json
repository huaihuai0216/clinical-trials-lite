BTSCS is designed to address the cognitive, motivational, and social support problems characteristic of people with SPMI.\n\nThe investigators propose to conduct a randomized trial for persons with SPMI that compares (1) BTSCS: a 6-month manualized smoking cessation program adapted from an effective substance abuse treatment program for this population to (2) StSST: a standard manualized smoking cessation program which reflects current best practices.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Cigarettes Smoked Per Day","timeFrame":"day","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BTSCS","deltaMin":15.4,"sd":9.8},{"arm":"StSST","deltaMin":14.9,"sd":10}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.489"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26457385"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":92},"commonTop":[]}}
