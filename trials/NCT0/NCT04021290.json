The main objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG/3TC FDC once daily compared to continuation of CAR over 48 weeks in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV-1. The study will also evaluate information regarding the safety and health related quality of life. The study will include Screening Phase (up to 28 days), a Randomization Phase (up to Week 52) and a Continuation Phase (post Week 52). The Continuation Phase is not applicable for participants in Sweden and Denmark. Approximately 490 participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive DTG/3TC FDC once daily for up to 52 weeks or continue their CAR for 52 weeks. Participants in the DTG/3TC FDC arm who successfully complete up to 52 weeks of treatment will have the opportunity to continue receiving DTG/3TC FDC once daily in Continuation Phase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) >=50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) as Per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot Category at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Randomized Phase-Participants Who Received DTG/3TC FDC","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Randomized Phase-Participants Who Received CAR","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":119,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35235656","39225890","39015350","38515183","34358493"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":246},"commonTop":["Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Weight increased","COVID-19","Back pain"]}}
