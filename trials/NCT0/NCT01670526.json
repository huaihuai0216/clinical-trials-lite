However, there is very little information about pharmacologic (i.e., medication) treatments targeting these deficits. There are growing data showing brain abnormalities in acetylcholine, the chemical system that manages memory, in TBI. These findings provide the rationale for the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, medications that modulate this system, in TBI patients. As the prevalence of TBI among Veterans of recent military conflicts increases, becoming a \"signature injury\" of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, it is of utmost importance to the Veterans Health Administration to collect scientific data on the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for intellectual difficulties in TBI patients. This study will evaluate the effects of the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine transdermal patch in Veterans with TBI and posttraumatic memory problems. Results will provide much needed data that will help treat Veterans with TBI.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Demonstrated Improvement From Baseline on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall","timeFrame":"week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rivastigmine","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":23,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"19 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34213962","33514274"],"seeAlso":["http://www.warrelatedillness.va.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":49},"commonTop":["accident at work","Application site erythema","application site irritation","Application site pruritus","Carpel tunnel syndrome"]}}
