Acceptable forms of contraception for this study include hormonal contraceptives (oral, implant, transdermal patch, or injection) at a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Screening, barrier (spermicidal condom or diaphragm with spermicide), IUD, or a partner who has been vasectomized for at least 6 months.
