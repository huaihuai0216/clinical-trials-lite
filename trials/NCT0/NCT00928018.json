Since mTOR inhibitors have anti-lymphoma activity, their use after transplantation may lead to a decreased risk of relapse and hence better transplantation outcome.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"To Compare 2-year Overall Survival of Patients With Lymphoma Undergoing RIC SCT Between Those Receiving Tacrolimus/Sirolimus/Methotrexate and Those Receiving Tacrolimus/Methotrexate or Cyclosporine/Mycophenolate Mofetil","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sirolimus-Containing Regimen","deltaMin":70,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sirolimus-Free Regimen","deltaMin":68,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26729448"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":66},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Thrombocytopenia","Infection","Hepatic","TMA/renal failure/hemolysis"]}}
