biopsy confirmation is required if the lesion(s) measures \\< 30 mm or if the treating physician determines it is clinically indicated; patients must have at least one \"target lesion\" to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); this lesion should be the one that was biopsied if one was performed; tumors within a previously irradiated field will be designated as \"non-target\" lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1500/mcl\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcl\n* Serum creatinine =\\< upper limit of normal (ULN) (Common Toxicity Criteria \\[CTC\\] grade 0) or calculated creatinine clearance (Jeliffe formula) \\>= 60 ml/min\n* Bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x institutional normal\n* Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) =\\< 2.5 x institutional normal\n* Alkaline phosphatase =\\< 2.5 x institutional normal\n* Prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is =\\< 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin for management of venous thrombosis including pulmonary thrombo-embolus)\n* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\< 1.2 times the upper limit of normal\n* Urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPC ratio) \\< 1.0\n* Patients must have a GOG performance status of 0 or 1\n* Patients must have recovered from the effects of surgery, radiation therapy, or chemoradiotherapy;
