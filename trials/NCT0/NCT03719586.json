No medicines are approved to treat it. Researchers need to test new medicines to see if they help people recover from Ebola and are safe to give. They need to test the drugs and compare them in a controlled way. Researchers want to test 4 drugs with people who have Ebola and are in treatment centers.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the safety and effectiveness of 4 drugs for people with Ebola virus.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople of any age with Ebola infection who are in treatment centers\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with questions, medical history, and blood tests.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to get 1 of 3 study drugs:\n\n* ZMapp by IV over about 4 hours. It will be given 3 times, 3 days apart.\n* Remdesivir by IV over about 1 hour. It will be given once a day for 10 days.\n* Mab114 by IV for 30-60 minutes. It will be given 1 time.\n* REGN-EB3 by IV for about 2 hours. It will be given 1 time.\n\nFor at least a week, participants will stay in isolation in a clinic. They will:\n\n* Get supportive care and be monitored\n* Have a small plastic tube (IV) put in an arm vein for several days to give fluids and collect blood.\n* Get their study drug.\n* Be monitored for disease signs and drug side effects. They may get medicines for side effects.\n* Have blood and urine tests.\n\nParticipants will stay in the clinic until they finish the study drug and are well enough to leave.\n\nParticipants will have 2 follow-up visits over 2 months. They will answer questions and give blood and semen samples.\n\n...","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Remdesivir Plus Optimized Standard of Care (oSOC)","deltaMin":93,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: MAb114 Plus Optimized Standard of Care (oSOC)","deltaMin":61,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C: REGN-EB3 Plus Optimized Standard of Care (oSOC)","deltaMin":52,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Arm (D): ZMapp Plus Optimized Standard of Care (oSOC)","deltaMin":84,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States","Democratic Republic of the Congo"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33217357","31774950"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?A_2019-I-0003.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":175},"commonTop":["incomplete study drug infusion(s)"]}}
