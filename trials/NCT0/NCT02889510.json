As experimental studies with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) have shown an increase in pulmonary surfactant secretion, and the GLP-1 receptor has been found in significant amounts in the lung, it could be hypothesized that the treatment with liraglutide (a GL-1 agonist) will improve this reduced pulmonary function","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes From Baseline on Measurements of Respiratory Function Defined by Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)","timeFrame":"7 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide","deltaMin":4.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["10960726","18056886","11282754","20882512","20217039","19262746","18285549","18579551","14988297","15526520","34737187"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":70},"commonTop":["Gastrointestinal disorders","Infections and infestations","Nervous system disorders","Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders","Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders"]}}
