If any of the Hematology, Chemistries, or Urinalysis are not within the clinical laboratory's reference range, then the subject can be included only if the Investigator judges the deviations to be not clinically significant.\n* A history of SAR to Mountain Cedar for a minimum of two years immediately preceding the study Screening Visit. The SAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required treatment (either continuous or intermittent) in the past and in the Investigator's judgment (through exposure to allergen) is expected to require treatment throughout the entire study period.\n* A demonstrated sensitivity to Mountain Cedar known to induce SAR through a standard skin prick test administered at screening. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 5 mm larger than the control wheal (normal saline) for the skin prick test.\n* Subject, if female 65 years of age or younger, must have a negative serum pregnancy test. Females of childbearing potential must be instructed to and agree to avoid pregnancy during the study and must use an acceptable method of birth control: An oral contraceptive, an intrauterine device (IUD), implantable contraceptive, transdermal or injectable contraceptive for at least 1 month prior to entering the study and will continue its use throughout the study and for thirty days following study participation; Barrier method of contraception, eg, condom and/or diaphragm with spermicide while participating in the study; Abstinence.\n* Subject or parent/guardian must possess an educational level and degree of understanding of English that enables them to communicate suitably with the Investigator and study coordinator as well as accurately complete both the AR diary and RQLQ(S).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Female subject who is pregnant or lactating.\n* History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other clinically significant respiratory tract malformations; recent nasal biopsy; nasal trauma; nasal ulcers or perforations; or surgery and atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa (all within the last 60 days prior to the Screening Visit).\n* Participation in any investigational drug trial within the 30 days preceding the Screening Visit or planned participation in another investigational drug trial at any time during this trial.\n* A known hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid or any of the excipients in the formulation of ciclesonide.\n* History of a respiratory infection or disorder \\[including, but not limited to bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\\] within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit .\n* History of alcohol or drug abuse within two years preceding the Screening Visit.\n* History of a positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\n* Plans to travel outside the study area (the known pollen area for the investigative site) for more than 24 hours during the Run-in period.\n* Plans to travel outside the study area (the known pollen area for the investigative site) for 2 or more consecutive days between Randomization Visit and the final Treatment Visit.\n* Active asthma requiring treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids and/or routine use of beta-agonists and any controller drugs (eg, theophylline, leukotriene antagonists, etc.); intermittent use (less than or equal to 3 uses per week) of inhaled short acting beta-agonists is acceptable.\n* Use of any disallowed concomitant medications within the prescribed (per protocol) time period prior to the Screening Visit and expected use during treatment period.\n* Use of antibiotic therapy for acute conditions within 14 days prior to the Screening Visit. Low doses of antibiotics taken for prophylaxis are permitted if the therapy was started prior to the Screening Visit and is expected to continue throughout the trial.\n* Initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or dose escalation during the study period. However, initiation of immunotherapy 90 days or more prior to the Screening Visit and use of a stable (maintenance) dose (30 days or more) may be considered for inclusion.\n* Previous participation in an intranasal ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol study.\n* Non-vaccinated exposure to or active infection with, chickenpox or measles within the 21 days preceding the Screening Visit.\n* Initiation of pimecrolimus cream 1% or greater or tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or greater during the study period or planned dose escalation during the study period. However, initiation of these creams/ointments 30 days or more prior to screening and use of a stable (maintenance) dose during the study period may be considered for inclusion.\n* Study participation by clinical investigator site employees and/or their immediate relatives.\n* Study participation by more than one subject from the same household at the same time.\n* Have any of the following conditions that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant and/or affect the subject's ability to participate in the clinical trial:\n\n  * impaired hepatic function including alcohol-related liver disease or cirrhosis;\n  * history of ocular disturbances eg, glaucoma or posterior subcapsular cataracts;\n  * any systemic infection;\n  * hematological, hepatic, renal, endocrine (except for controlled diabetes mellitus or postmenopausal symptoms or hypothyroidism);\n  * gastrointestinal disease;\n  * malignancy (excluding basal cell carcinoma);\n  * current neuropsychological condition with or without drug therapy.\n* Any condition that, in the judgement of the investigator, would preclude the subject from completing the protocol with capture of the assessments as written.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Daily Subject-reported AM and PM Reflective TNSS Averaged Over the Two-week Treatment Period.","description":"TNSS is the sum of individual symptoms of runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose, and nasal congestions.
