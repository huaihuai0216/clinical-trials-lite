Bone-specified alkaline phosphate (BAP) was measured by paramagnetic particle immunoassay. P1NP was the bone turnover marker upon which we based sample size calculations.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"42","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"186","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Trabecular Spine vBMD","description":"Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the lumbar spine, hip, and distal one-third radius was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorption at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
