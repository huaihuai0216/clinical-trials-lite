The patient must have histologically or cytologically proven peritoneal carcinomatosis from low-grade mucinous adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with no tissue for examination may undergo percutaneous needle aspiration under computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound guidance as clinically indicated or a laparotomy with biopsy if a tumor grade cannot be determined on other available material.\n  2. Radiologic workup must demonstrate that there is no imageable disease outside of the peritoneal cavity.\n  3. Radiologic workup or prior abdominal exploration must show abnormalities consistent with disease which can be debulked to a residual size of less than 1 cm in diameter per tumor deposit in the judgement of the investigators.\n  4. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of less than or equal to 2 on study entry and on the day prior to planned treatment.\n  5. Patients must have a minimum expected duration of survival of greater than 16 weeks.\n  6. Patients must have recovered from any severe toxicity from all prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy except as outlined in appendix 1 of the protocol and be at least 30 days past the date of their last treatment.\n  7. Patients must have a serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) within 5 times the upper limit of normal and a total serum bilirubin of less than 3 times the upper limit of normal, both of which define the upper limit of grade 2 treatment related toxicities..\n  8. Patients must have a absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1,500/microliter.\n  9. Patients must be age greater than or equal to 18 years.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1. Patients will be excluded if they have concomitant medical problems that would place them at unacceptable risk for a major surgical procedure.\n\n   1. Patients at increased risk for coronary artery disease or cardiac dysfunction (e.g. age greater than 65, and a history of hypertension, first degree relative with atherosclerotic coronary artery evaluation and will not be eligible if they demonstrate significant irreversible ischemia on a stress thallium study or an ejection fraction of less than 40%.\n   2. Patients who have shortness of breath with minimal exertion or who are at risk for pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic smokers) will undergo pulmonary function testing and will not be eligible if their forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1) is less than 1.2 liters or their maximum voluntary ventilation is less than 50% of expected.\n2. Patients who have a neurological toxicity of Grade 3 or greater will be excluded because of the potential neurotoxicity associated with platinum and paclitaxel therapy.\n3. Patients will be ineligible if they have a serum creatinine of greater than 1.5 mg/dL unless the measured creatinine clearance is greater than 60mL/min/1.73m\\^2.\n4. Patients will be ineligible if platelets are less than 75, 000/mm\\^3.\n5. Patients who have failed previous intraperitoneal chemotherapy will be ineligible.\n6. Pregnant women or women who are breast-feeding will be ineligible.\n7. Patients less than 30 kg will be ineligible.\n8. Patients who have undergone two or more operative procedures to debulk disease, have received 2 or more regimens of systemic chemotherapy, or any previous continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) therapy will be excluded from study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression Free Survival","description":"CHPP is administered as a heated cisplatin solution delivered to the abdomen through a catheter (plastic tube), washed through the abdomen for 90 minutes, and then drained out of the body through another catheter.\n\nProgression is defined as imageable tumor nodules or increasing ascites persistent on two serial computed tomography (CT) scans.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With an Adverse Event","description":"Here is the number of participants with an adverse event.
