Therapies spread over the skin may not be enough to control the AD in trial participants who require systemic anti-inflammatory treatment. This study compares upadacitinib to dupilumab in adolescent and adult participants with moderate to severe AD who have inadequate response to systemic therapies. Adverse events and change in the disease activity will be assessed.\n\nUpadacitinib and dupilumab are approved drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The study is comprised of a 35-day Screening Period, a 16-week treatment Period 1 and a 16-week treatment Period 2. Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups called treatment arms to receive upadacitinib Dose A or dupilumab in Period 1. There is a 30-day or 12-week follow-up visit for those on upadacitinib or dupilumab respectively, who will not enter Period 2. In Period 2, participants will receive upadacitinib Dose A or Dose B for 16 weeks, followed by a 30-day follow-up visit. Approximately 880 adolescent and adult participants ages 12 to 64 with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy will be enrolled at up to 330 sites worldwide.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care . Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving a ≥ 90% Reduction From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI 90) and Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale of 0 or 1 (WP-NRS 0/1) at Week 16","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dupilumab (Period 1)","deltaMin":8.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Upadacitinib (Period 1)","deltaMin":19.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":257,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Croatia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Romania","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.rxabbvie.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":462},"commonTop":["NASOPHARYNGITIS","ACNE","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","DERMATITIS ATOPIC","HEADACHE"]}}
