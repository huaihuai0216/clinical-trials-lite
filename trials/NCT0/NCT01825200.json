Another hypothesis is that the safety and reactogenicity of Flublok is clinically acceptable, i.e. consistent with the overall safety profiles previously observed with Flublok and with the licensed comparator.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Common Hypersensitivity Reactions as Measure of Safety","timeFrame":"30 Days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Flublok","deltaMin":31,"sd":null},{"arm":"Afluria","deltaMin":21,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26529070"],"seeAlso":["http://proteinsciences.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":1314},"commonTop":["Headache","Diarrhea"]}}
