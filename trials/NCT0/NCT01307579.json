Antifungal prophylaxis is considered standard of care in children and adults with prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy for AML however the ideal antifungal agent for prophylaxis in children is not known. Caspofungin has activity against yeast and some molds while fluconazole coverage is limited to just yeasts. Adult randomized trials suggest that agents with activity against yeasts and molds are more effective than those with just activity against yeasts. There are limited data to answer this comparative question in children. This study will establish much needed pediatric data to guide clinical decision making on optimal antifungal prophylaxis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Proven or Probable Invasive Fungal Infections (IFI)","timeFrame":"Up to 5 months since enrollment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Caspofungin Acetate)","deltaMin":3.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Fluconazole)","deltaMin":7.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":179,"countries":["United States","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31688884"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":253},"commonTop":["Sepsis","Hypokalemia","Hypotension","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Respiratory failure"]}}
