The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210, with 30 indicating absence of symptoms of schizophrenia and 210 indicating extreme ratings of all 30 symptoms. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvements in symptoms.\n\nEstimates (least square means and standard errors), 2-sided confidence intervals, and -1-sided P values are based on a repeated-measures linear regression model of the change from baseline score, with fixed effects for visit as a categorical variable, baseline score, treatment and treatment by visit interaction, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-15.367","spread":"1.2230"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-16.456","spread":"1.2073"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-9.219","spread":"1.2162"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) Analysis of Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Clinical Global Impression - Severity Scale (CGI-S)","description":"The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant.

AEs are determined by the Investigator to be related or not related to the study drug.\n\nA serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
