Patients from trials 1220.7, 1220.30 and 1220.47 of BI 201335 who have failed treatment with PegIFN/RBV in the placebo groups due to protocol-defined criteria of treatment failure (i.e. either non-response on treatment or relapse after end of treatment \\[EOT\\]).\n2. Patients must have received at least 4 weeks of assigned trial medication and been compliant with all study procedures.\n3. Female patients:\n\n   * with documented hysterectomy,\n   * who have had both ovaries removed,\n   * with documented tubal ligation,\n   * who are post-menopausal with last menstrual period at least 12 months prior to screening, or\n   * of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and Day 1, that, if sexually active, agree to use one of the appropriate medically accepted methods of birth control from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of RBV in addition to the consistent and correct use of a condom. Patients must agree not to breast-feed at any time from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of RBV.\n\n   Medically accepted methods of contraception for females in this trial are ethinyl estradiol-containing contraceptives, diaphragm with spermicide substance, intra-uterine device and cervical cap.\n\n   or\n\n   Male patients:\n   * who are documented to be sterile, or\n   * who are without pregnant female partner(s) and consistently and correctly use a condom while their female partner(s) (if of child-bearing potential) agree to use one of the appropriate medically accepted methods of birth control from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin. It is in the responsibility of the male patient to ensure that his partner(s) is not pregnant prior to screening into the study or becomes pregnant during the treatment and the observation phase. Female partners of childbearing potential must perform monthly pregnancy tests from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin (tests will be provided by the sponsor).\n4. Signed informed consent form prior to trial participation.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Evidence of acute or chronic liver disease due to causes other than chronic HCV infection. Incidental steatosis diagnosed by biopsy is not an exclusion criteria.\n2. HIV co-infection\n3. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection based on presence of HBs-Ag\n4. Active malignancy, or history of malignancy within the last 5 years prior to screening (with an exception of appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix)\n5. Active or, history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse other than cannabis within the past 12 months\n6. A condition that is defined as one which in the opinion of investigator may put the patient at risk because of participation in this study, may influence the results of this study, or limit the patients ability to participate in this study\n7. Usage of any investigational drugs within 30 days prior to screening, or planned usage of an investigational drug during the course of this study.\n8. Received concomitant systemic antiviral, hematopoietic growth factor, or immunomodulatory treatment within 30 days prior to screening. Patients being treated with oral antivirals such as acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir for recurrent herpes simplex infection; or with oseltamivir or zanamivir for influenza A infection, may be screened.\n9. Received silymarin (milk thistle), glycyrrhizin, or Sho-saiko-to (SST) within 28 days prior to enrolment and throughout the treatment phase of this trial.\n10. Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drugs.\n11. Alpha fetoprotein value \\> 100 ng/mL at screening; if \\> 20 ng/mL and = 100 ng/mL, patients may be included if there is no evidence of liver cancer in an appropriate imaging study (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI) within last 6 months prior to randomization (Visit 2).\n\nOther exclusion criteria related to pegylated interferon and/or ribavirin restrictions are not listed here.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Sustained Virological Response (SVR): Plasma HCV RNA Level < 25 IU/mL","description":"The primary endpoint was SVR12, defined as a plasma Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Ribonucleic acid (RNA) level \\<25 IU/mL (undetected) 12 weeks after the originally planned treatment duration.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"54.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Sustained Virological Response After 24 Weeks of Treatment Discontinuation (SVR24)","description":"Sustained virologic response 24 weeks, defined as a plasma HCV RNA level \\< 25 IU/mL (undetected) 24 weeks after the originally planned treatment duration.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"54.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Early Treatment Success (ETS)","description":"ETS, defined as a plasma HCV RNA level \\<25 IU/mL (detected or undetected) at week 4 and HCV RNA \\<25 IU/mL (undetected) at week 8.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"97.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"65.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Normalisation: ALT in Normal Range at End of Treatment (EoT)","description":"This will be presented as the number of patients in/not in normal range from baseline EoT.
