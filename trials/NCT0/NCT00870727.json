This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole in the management of the maladaptive behaviors of Pervasive Developmental Disorder. The investigators hypothesize that aripiprazole will be more effective than placebo for reducing aggression, tantrum and self-injurious behavior in children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Improved as Measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement Scale (Improvement Defined as CGI-I=1 or CGI-I=2)","timeFrame":"Double-blind phase study exit - up to 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1.
