prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external beam or brachytherapy)\n* If post-radical prostatectomy, PSA \\> 0.2 ng/mL measured \\> 6 weeks post-operative and confirmed persistent PSA \\> 0.2 ng/mL (AUA recommendation for biochemical recurrence)\n* If post-radiation therapy, PSA that is ≥ 2 mg/mL rise above PSA nadir (ASTRO recommendation for biochemical recurrence)\n* Not receiving any other investigational agents (i.e., unlabeled drugs or drugs under an IND for initial efficacy investigations)\n* No other malignancy within the past 2 years (skin basal cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma or superficial bladder cancer are exempt from this criterion)\n* Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 50 (ECOG/WHO of 0, 1, or 2)\n* Ability to understand and willingness to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Cannot receive furosemide\n* History of Stevens Johnson syndrome\n* History or diagnosis of Paget's disease\n* Malignancy other than current disease under study\n* Allergy to sulfa or sulfa-containing medications\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
