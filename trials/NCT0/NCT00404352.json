The event must be a new neurological abnormality present for at least 24 hours, either mono- or polysymptomatic, other than a paresthesia, vegetative or cerebral dysfunction\n* At least two clinically silent lesions on the T2-weighted MRI scan, with a size of at least 3 millimeter (mm), at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial\n* EDSS 0 - 5.0 at least one time point during the screening period before start of treatment\n* 18 and 50 years old, inclusive\n* Willing to follow study procedures\n* Written informed consent\n* If female, subject must:\n\n  * be neither pregnant nor breast-feeding nor attempting to conceive\n  * use a highly effective method of contraception. A highly effective method of contraception is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (that is \\[i.e.\\] less than 1 percent \\[%\\] per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Diagnosis of MS (per McDonald criteria 2005)\n* Any other disease that could better explain the subject's signs and symptoms\n* Complete transverse myelitis or bilateral optic neuritis\n* Subject uses or has used any other approved MS disease-modifying drug (DMD)\n* Any investigational drug or undergone an experimental procedure within 12 weeks prior to study Day 1\n* Oral or systemic corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) within 30 days prior to study Day 1\n* Total bilirubin greater than 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Subject has total aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) greater than 2.5 times the ULN\n* Inadequate bone marrow reserve, defined as a total white blood cell count less than 3.0 x 109 per liter (/L), platelet count less than 75 x 109/L, hemoglobin less than 100 gram per liter (g/L)\n* Current autoimmune disease\n* Major medical or psychiatric illness (including history of or current severe depressive disorders and/or suicidal ideation) that in the opinion of the investigator creates undue risk to the subject or could affect compliance with the study protocol\n* History of seizures not adequately controlled by treatment\n* Cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia\n* Known allergy to IFN-beta or the excipient(s) of the study medication\n* Any condition that could interfere with the MRI evaluation;\n* Known allergy to gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)\n* Previously participated in this study\n* Participated in any clinical trial within the past 6 months\n* Any immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapy at any time prior to enrollment, including, but not limited to, the following products: any IFN, glatiramer acetate (Copolymer I), cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, linomide, azathioprine, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, laquinimod, cladribine, total lymphoid irradiation, anti-lymphocyte monoclonal antibody treatment (e.g. natalizumab, alemtuzumab/Campath, anti-cluster of differentiation 4 \\[CD4\\]), intravenous, immunoglobulins (Igs), cytokines or anti-cytokine therapy\n* Any experimental MS treatment prior to trial entry, including, but not limited to, any statins (if given to prevent MS) and pentoxyfylline\n* History of alcohol or drug abuse\n* Intolerance or any contraindication to both paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen\n* Inability to administer subcutaneous injections either by self or by caregiver\n* Moderate to severe renal impairment","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to Conversion to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) According to the McDonald Criteria (2005)","description":"The McDonald criteria use dissemination in time and space established by magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings to provide a clinical diagnosis for MS.
