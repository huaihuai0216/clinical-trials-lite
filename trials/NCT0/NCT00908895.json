In Canada, most patients with unstable fractures are treated with pinning and cast. Results are often associated with shortening and lack of function.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to compare stabilization with a radio-radial fixator to the usual method, suggesting that the radio-radial fixator will provide more strength at 6 months follow-up.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Grip Strength","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Radio-radial Fixator","deltaMin":98.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Percutaneous Pinning","deltaMin":62.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":57},"commonTop":[]}}
