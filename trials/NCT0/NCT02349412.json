The palliative care services provided to patients randomized to the intervention will be provided by board-certified physicians and/or advanced practice nurses and will focus on the following areas: (1) developing and maintaining the therapeutic relationship with the patients and family caregivers; (2) assessing and treating patient symptoms; (3) providing support and reinforcement of coping with advanced cancer in patients and family caregivers; (4) assessing and enhancing prognostic awareness and illness understanding in patients and family caregivers; (5) assisting with treatment decision-making; and (6) end-of-life care planning.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Quality of Life (QOL) From Baseline to Week 12 Per the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)","timeFrame":"Up to 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1 (Early Palliative Care)","deltaMin":3.35,"sd":14.7},{"arm":"Arm 2 (Usual Care)","deltaMin":0.12,"sd":12.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.104"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32031887","28097515"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
