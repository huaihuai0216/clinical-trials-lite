Participants will be treated with N9-GP. This is a medicine that doctors can already prescribe in other countries. The medicine will be injected into a vein (intravenous injection). At the visits to the clinic, the medicine will be injected by the study doctor. When treating themselves at home, participants inject the medicine using a needle and vial set. The study will last for about 12-16 months. The participants will have between 9 and 19 visits to the clinic and possibly also some phone calls with the study doctor. At all visits to the clinic, the participants will have blood samples taken.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Haemostatic Effect of Nonacog Beta Pegol When Used for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes During on Demand and Prophylaxis (PPX)","timeFrame":"From start of treatment (week 0) until end of treatment (up to week 50)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Nonacog Beta Pegol (On-demand)","deltaMin":203,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm A: Nonacog Beta Pegol (Prophylaxis)","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Nonacog Beta Pegol (Prophylaxis)","deltaMin":26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":14,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":15},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Upper respiratory tract infection","Pyrexia","Coronavirus infection","Diarrhoea"]}}
