Criteria","description":"Clinical Response is measured using RECIST 1.1. criteria. CR (Complete response) is defined as disappearance of all target lesion, and pathological lymph node showing reduction of its shortest axis to less than 10 mm. PR (Partial response) is defined as reduction of total target lesion diameter at least by 30%. PD (Progressive disease) is defined as total target lesion diameter increased in size atleast by 20% or 5 mm OR occurence of one new lesion. SD (Stable disease) is defined as absence of reduction or increasing of target lesion. Patients with PR and CR are considered as positive response. Patients with SD and PD are considered as negative response.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Expression of HIF-1⍺ as Measured by qRT-PCR Absolute Quantification","description":"Expression of HIF-1⍺ is measured at the initial period of the study (baseline) and after 3 neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycles are completed using qRT-PCR Absolute Quantification.
