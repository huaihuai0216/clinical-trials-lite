The study will consist of a 48-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed by a 48-week open-label treatment period. Participants will be assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to double-blind treatment with active tocilizumab or matching placebo. In the open-label period, eligible participants from either arm may receive active tocilizumab.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) During Double-blind Period","timeFrame":"From baseline to week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Double-Blind Placebo","deltaMin":-4.41,"sd":null},{"arm":"Double-Blind Tocilizumab","deltaMin":-6.14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0983"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":83,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Lithuania","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Romania","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37228011","34851799","33538094","33294861","32866440"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":106},"commonTop":["SKIN ULCER","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","NASOPHARYNGITIS","ARTHRALGIA","DIARRHOEA"]}}
