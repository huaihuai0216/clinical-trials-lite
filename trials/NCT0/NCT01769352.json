Patients with nonexudative Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) or non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without macular edema can be included in the study.\n* Other reason for decreased visual acuity (such as amblyopia, foveal atrophy, optic atrophy).\n* Pre-existing diagnosis of glaucoma in the study eye\n* Inability to comply with study or follow up procedures\n* Pregnancy (Women of child bearing age will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test prior to enrolling in the study).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Change in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity at Week 12 From Baseline","description":"Mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (Letter Score) at Week 12 from Baseline.
