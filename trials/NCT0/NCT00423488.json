Subjects must not have had a change in antidiabetic pharmacotherapy \\[i.e. changes in dosage (with the exception of +/- 10 units of insulin) or addition of new medication\\] or experience recent history of repeated hypoglycemia or unstable glycemic control within 3 months of Visit (Baseline Visit).\n* Subjects must have documented coronary heart disease (CHD). For the purposes of this study, CHD will include one or more of the following features: documented stable angina with evidence of ischemia on exercise testing); history of myocardial infarction; history of percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCTI) with or without stent placement); symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (claudication); documented history of atherothrombotic cerebrovascular disease; and/or documented history of unstable angina or non-Q wave myocardial infarction.\n* Subjects must have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration \\>=2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) to \\<=4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) using the Friedewald calculation available at the time of randomization Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Subjects must have triglyceride concentrations of \\<3.99 mmol/L (350 mg/dL) at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Subject must be currently taking simvastatin 20 mg daily and by history has taken 80% of daily evening doses for the 6 weeks prior to Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Subject must be \\>=18 years and \\<=75 years of age.\n* Subjects must have maintained a cholesterol lowering diet and exercise program for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 2) and be willing to continue the same diet and exercise program during the study.\n* Subjects must have liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\], aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\]) \\<50% above the upper limit of normal, with no active liver disease, and creatinine kinase (CK)\\<50% above the upper limit of normal at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistries, urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the investigator at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Subjects must report a stable weight history for at least 4 weeks prior to entry into study at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Women receiving hormonal therapy, including hormone replacement, any estrogen antagonist/agonist, or oral contraceptives, must have been maintained on a stable dose and regimen for at least 8 weeks and be willing to continue the same regimen for the duration of the study.\n* Women of childbearing potential (includes women who are less than 1 year postmenopausal and women who become sexually active) must be using an acceptable method of birth control (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, medically-prescribed intrauterine device (IUD), condom in combination with spermicide) or be surgically sterilized (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation).\n* Subjects must be free of any clinically significant diseases other than diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would interfere with study evaluations.\n* Subjects must understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and must agree to remain on their cholesterol-lowering diet and their exercise regimen for the duration of the study\n* Subjects must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply with its procedures by signing a written informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects whose body mass index (BMI = weight\\[kg\\]/height\\[m\\]\\*\\*2) is \\>=35 kg/m\\*\\*2 at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Subjects who consume \\>14 alcoholic drinks per week.

Subjects with a history of hypothyroidism who are on a stable therapy of thyroid hormone replacement for at least 6 weeks are eligible for enrollment if TSH levels are within normal limits at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Impaired renal function (creatinine \\>2.0 mg/dL) or nephrotic syndrome at Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Disorders of the hematologic, digestive, or central nervous systems including cerebrovascular disease and degenerative disease that would limit study evaluation or participation.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.\n* Cancer within the past 5 years (except for successfully treated basal and squamous cell carcinomas).\n* History of mental instability, drug/alcohol abuse within the past 5 years, or major psychiatric illness not adequately controlled and stable on pharmacotherapy.\n* Subjects who have not observed the designated wash-out period for any of the prohibited medications.\n* Subjects currently consuming large amounts of grapefruit juice (\\>1 liter/day).\n* Oral corticosteroids, unless used as replacement therapy for pituitary/adrenal disease and the subject is on a stable regimen for at lest 6 weeks prior to Visit 3 (Baseline Visit).\n* Subjects who are currently using cardiovascular medication (e.g., antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic) and have not been on a stable regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 3 (Baseline Visit) and it is expected to change during the study.\n* Subjects who are currently using psyllium, other fiber-based laxatives, and/or any other over-the-counter (OTC) therapy known to affect serum lipid levels (phytosterol margarine), and have not been on a stable regimen for at least 5 weeks prior to study entry Visit 3 (Baseline Visit) and who do not agree to remain on this regimen throughout the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percent Change in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) From Baseline to Endpoint, After 6 Weeks of Treatment","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-32.2","spread":"15.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-20.8","spread":"20.1"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}}
