There is currently no standard treatment for LAL-D other than supportive care. Enzyme replacement therapy may be a potential new treatment option for LAL-D participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Of Participants Achieving Alanine Aminotransferase Normalization","timeFrame":"Double-blind Period: Baseline to the end of the Double-blind Period (Week 20).
