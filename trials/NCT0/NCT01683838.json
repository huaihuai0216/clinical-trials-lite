The test measures extension of the right and left hamstring muscle and flexion of the right and left quadriceps muscle using the following 5-point grading scale:\n\n1=no increased tone; 2=slight increase in tone, giving a \"catch\" when the affected part is moved in flexion or extension; 3=more marked increase in tone, but affected part is easily flexed; 4=considerable increase in tone, passive movement is difficult; 5=affected part is rigid in flexion and extension.\n\nThe Ashworth Score was determined by adding all individual scores for each muscle group and dividing by four. Higher Ashworth Scores indicated greater spasticity.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.28","spread":"0.046"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.16","spread":"0.047"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Double-blind Change From Baseline in Mean Subject's Global Impression (SGI) Scores","description":"The SGI is a 7-unit ordinal scale used by the subject to evaluate the effects of study medication on his/her quality of life during the preceding week, with higher scores denoting greater satisfaction.
