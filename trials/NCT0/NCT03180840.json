Age: 18-60 years\n2. A documented diagnosis of Fabry disease\n3. Males: plasma and/or leucocyte alpha galactosidase activity (by activity assay) less than lower limit of normal according to the laboratory reference ranges and one or more of the characteristic features of Fabry disease\n\n   1. Neuropathic pain\n   2. Cornea verticillata\n   3. Clustered angiokeratoma\n4. Females: historical genetic test results consistent with Fabry mutations, or in the case of novel mutations a first-degree male relative with Fabry disease, and one or more of the characteristic features of Fabry disease\n\n   1. Neuropathic pain\n   2. Cornea verticillata\n   3. Clustered angiokeratoma\n5. Treatment with agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta for at least 3 years and on a stable dose (\\>80% labelled dose/kg) for at least last 6 months\n6. eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m\\^2 by CKD-EPI equation at screening visit\n7. Availability of at least 3 historical serum creatinine evaluations since starting agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta treatment and not more than 2 years old\n8. Female patients and male patients whose co-partners are of child-bearing potential agree to use a medically accepted, highly effective method of contraception. These include combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal), progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, or implantable), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomised partner, or sexual abstinence\n9. Patients whose clinical condition, in the opinion of the Investigator, is suitable for treatment with ERT every 4 weeks.\n\nKey exclusion criteria:\n\nThe presence of any of the following excludes a subject from study enrollment:\n\n1. History of anaphylaxis or Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta\n2. History of renal dialysis or transplantation\n3. Linear negative slope of eGFR of ≥ 2 mL/min/1.73m\\^2/year based on at least 4 serum creatinine values over approximately 2 years (including the value obtained at the screening visit)\n4. History of acute kidney injury in the 12 months prior to screening, including specific kidney diseases (e.g., acute interstitial nephritis, acute glomerular and vasculitic renal diseases); non-specific conditions (e.g., ischemia, toxic injury); as well as extrarenal pathology (e.g., prerenal azotemia and acute post renal obstructive nephropathy)\n5. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy initiated or dose changed in the 4 weeks prior to screening\n6. Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) at screening \\> 0.5 g/g or mg/mg or 500 mg/g and not treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB\n7. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant during the study, or are breast feeding\n8. Cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the 6-month period before screening\n9. Cerebrovascular event (stroke, transient ischemic attack) in the 6-month period before screening\n10. Presence of any medical, emotional, behavioral, or psychological condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator and/or Medical Director, would interfere with the patient's compliance with the requirements of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"60 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events (TEAE) as Assessed by CTCAE v4.03","description":"Results represent the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) that were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)","description":"eGFR was calculated based on the serum creatinine values that were assessed at Day 1, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52 according to the CKD-EPI formula, baseline and Month 12 (week 52) reported.
