Given that the efficacy of etoricoxib vs. placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis has been established, and that prescription drugs, such as celecoxib, are available for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis in Korea, it would be inappropriate to subject patients with a flare of osteoarthritic pain to the placebo treatment for 12 weeks, and thus the study is designed as an active-comparator study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time-Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Etoricoxib 30 mg","deltaMin":-21.4,"sd":1.35},{"arm":"Celecoxib 200 mg","deltaMin":-19.76,"sd":1.34}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.390"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25133963"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":119},"commonTop":["Arthralgia"]}}
