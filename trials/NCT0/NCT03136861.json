To calculate the average spinal pain, the patient was asked to answer 2 questions to get 2 pain ratings, the total spinal pain corresponding to the intensity of spinal pain experienced on an average over 24 hours during the previous week and the nocturnal back pain corresponding to the intensity of spinal pain experienced on an average over the night during the previous week.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"188","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"73","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"77","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"202","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"75","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"92","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"187","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"76","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index Score Below 4 at Week 8 (Treatment Period 1)","description":"The Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) consists of a 0 through 10 scale, which is used to answer 6 questions pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis.

The mean of questions 5 and 6 is added to the scores from questions 1-4.
