Participants assessed their functional disability secondary to ocular (2 items), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 item), and gross motor or limb impairment (2 items). These 8 items were not weighted and were individually graded from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe), providing a total MG-ADL score ranging from 0 to 24 points. A reduction in score indicates improvement in condition. Baseline was defined as the last available assessment prior to treatment (first study drug infusion) with eculizumab in Study ECU-MG-302. Change from Baseline in MG-ADL total score at Week 4 (blind induction phase) and at Week 130 (open-label eculizumab phase) are presented.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.2","spread":"1.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.4","spread":"3.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.7","spread":"4.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.9","spread":"3.68"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":30,"n":56},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Arthralgia"]}}}
