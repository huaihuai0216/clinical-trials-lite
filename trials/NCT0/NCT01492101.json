symptoms.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.8","spread":"21.99"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.2","spread":"20.49"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.8","spread":"24.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.3","spread":"20.91"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.8","spread":"23.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.7","spread":"20.97"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.2","spread":"26.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.3","spread":"22.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.3","spread":"22.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.4","spread":"20.98"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.3","spread":"25.47"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.1","spread":"28.93"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.9","spread":"25.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-10.2","spread":"26.61"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.8","spread":"16.07"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.2","spread":"16.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"16.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.8","spread":"17.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.8","spread":"16.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.4","spread":"15.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.2","spread":"19.12"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-.7","spread":"12.82"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.4","spread":"16.66"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.7","spread":"16.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-9.6","spread":"19.68"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.6","spread":"15.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.3","spread":"17.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.7","spread":"13.06"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.6","spread":"19.84"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.2","spread":"23.64"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.3","spread":"18.41"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-8.6","spread":"21.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.9","spread":"29.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.5","spread":"28.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":"23.48"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.6","spread":"20.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-15.3","spread":"29.69"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.1","spread":"13.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-27.8","spread":"25.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.7","spread":"14.91"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-9.8","spread":"16.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":"0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.5","spread":"28.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.5","spread":"27.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.9","spread":"27.17"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.6","spread":"29.18"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.3","spread":"31.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.6","spread":"29.55"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.1","spread":"30.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.4","spread":"35.86"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.1","spread":"28.05"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.3","spread":"37.75"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.2","spread":"27.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.1","spread":"35.66"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.0","spread":"28.25"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.1","spread":"45.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":"13.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.9","spread":"16.03"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.0","spread":"14.95"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.1","spread":"17.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.2","spread":"15.55"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.9","spread":"17.39"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.5","spread":"13.5"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.3","spread":"18.01"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.2","spread":"16.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.1","spread":"18.33"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.3","spread":"11.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.4","spread":"15.68"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.1","spread":"11.06"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.8","spread":"21.84"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.7","spread":"15.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.2","spread
