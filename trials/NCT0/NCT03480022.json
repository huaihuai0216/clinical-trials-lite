Given that PCOS is a frequent condition and weight loss is essential but difficult to achieve, it is important to study if the effect on body weight reported in other studies can be confirmed in a selected population of hyperandrogenic patients, especially with medications currently approved for weight reduction. High dose liraglutide alone results in significant weight reduction in obese women without PCOS. There is limited data on weight loss with high dose liraglutide in non-diabetic females with PCOS treated with this agent . Studies on the effect of anti-obesity medication combined with lifestyle changes on body weight and composition and androgen excess in obese women diagnosed with PCOS are lacking. The investigators aim to elucidate the most efficacious weight reduction regime in obese PCOS women. The investigators further hope to determine which treatment(s) addressing the multifaceted disturbances of this disorder in patients with PCOS and obesity emerges as the preferable therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Absolute Body Weight (BW)","timeFrame":"32 weeks of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide Pen Injector (Saxenda)","deltaMin":104.7,"sd":2.9},{"arm":"Placebo Liraglutide Pen Injector","deltaMin":117.9,"sd":5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35710599"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":55},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Diarrhea","Constipation","prolonged menstrual bleeding"]}}
