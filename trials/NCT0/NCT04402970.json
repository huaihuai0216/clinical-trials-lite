Excessive amounts of NETs can increase rigidity of mucus, clog airways, and be agents for the development of acute respiratory distress (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Many aspects of this pathway have been observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al., Respiratory research. 2020). Dornase alfa (DNAse I; Pulmozyme (Genentech) is a nebulized drug that works by degrading cell-free DNA and thus promoting airway clearance and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that by thinning mucus and degrading these NETs further lung damage may be prevented and a reduction in time to recovery may occur. The two aims of the study are to see if inhaled/nebulized dornase alfa will improve clinical outcome measures in SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to see if dornase alfa reduces the amount of bronchoalveolar lavage and blood markers of NET activity.\n\nThe study will recruit patients who are on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure related to SARS-CoV-2 positive infection and have ARDS based upon Berlin criteria.\n\nThe investigators aim to recruit 10-20 patients for this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Arterial Blood Oxygen Content to Fraction of Inspired Oxygen Ratio (PaO2/FiO2)","timeFrame":"14 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Inhaled/Nebulized Dornase Alfa","deltaMin":10.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":21.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32302401","21703402","32216803","32355564","32329756","34745093"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":10},"commonTop":["Allergic reaction to drug"]}}
