Subject has RA duration of at least 3 months.\n* Subject has active RA defined as ≥ 6 swollen joints and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 66/68 joint count excluding distal interphalangeal joints) at screening and baseline and at least 1 of the following at screening:\n\n  * erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥ 28 mm/hr\n  * serum C-reactive protein \\> 1.0 mg/dL\n* Subject has a positive rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide at screening.\n* Subject has taken methotrexate (MTX) for ≥ 12 consecutive weeks and is on a stable dose of oral or subcutaneous MTX 7.5 to 25 mg/week for ≥

analgesics such as tramadol, Soma Compounds, Fioricet, or Fiorinal, the dose should be stable for ≥ 2 weeks before screening.\n* For a subject on oral corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent), the dose should be stable for ≥ 4 weeks before screening.\n* Subject has no known history of active tuberculosis.\n* Subject has a negative test for tuberculosis during screening defined as either:\n\n  * negative purified protein derivative (PPD) defined as \\< 5 mm of induration at 48 to 72 hours after test is placed OR\n  * negative Quantiferon test\n* Subject with a positive PPD
