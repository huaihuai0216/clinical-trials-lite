Patients often continue to experience problems despite current available treatment. The investigators' study will investigate the use of a new vasodilator called Fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor. The investigators' hypothesis is that Fasudil will prevent vasoconstriction of digital and cutaneous arteries during a standard laboratory based cold exposure and will therefore improve digital blood flow and skin temperature recovery time following cold challenge. These data will provide the rationale for a more elaborate clinical trials in real life situations.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Time to Recover 50% of Fall in the Baseline Skin Temperature.","timeFrame":"within 60 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"40 mg Fasudil","deltaMin":7.5,"sd":3.2},{"arm":"80 mg Fasudil","deltaMin":8.2,"sd":3},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.9,"sd":3.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":[]}}
