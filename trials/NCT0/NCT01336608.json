PWV increases with arterial stiffness and is defined by the Moens-Korteweg equation: PWV=square root of (Eh/2ρR), where E is Young's modulus of the arterial wall, h is the wall thickness, R is the arterial radius at the end of diastole, and ρ is the blood density. Change from BL was calculated as the Day 168 value minus the BL value.
