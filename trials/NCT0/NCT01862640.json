The CMAI assesses the frequency of agitated behaviors in elderly persons, such as hitting, cursing, and restlessness. It consists of 29 items all rated on a 1 to 7 scale with 1 being the \"best\" rating and 7 being the \"worst\" rating. The minimum possible CMAI total score is 29, and the maximum possible CMAI total score is 203. A decrease in score indicates improvement in symptoms. To control the overall type I error at 0.05 level when making 2 comparisons of brexpiprazole doses versus placebo, statistical testing was carried out using a hierarchical testing procedure in the order of: 1) comparison of 2 mg/day brexpiprazole versus placebo, and 2) comparison of 1 mg/day brexpiprazole versus placebo.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-21.6","spread":"1.32"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-17.6","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-17.8","spread":"1.34"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline In The Clinical Global Impression-Severity Of Illness (CGI-S) Score, As Related To Symptoms Of Agitation After 12 Weeks Of Brexpiprazole Treatment","description":"To compare the efficacy of 2 fixed doses (1 mg/day and 2 mg/day) of brexpiprazole with placebo in participants with agitation associated with Alzheimer's dementia, by the assessment of CGI-S score after 12 weeks of treatment.
