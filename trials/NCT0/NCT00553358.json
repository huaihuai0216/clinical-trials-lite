After this biological window, patients on monotherapy arms will continue on the same targeted therapy plus weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m\\^2 for a further 12 weeks, up to definitive surgery. In the combination arm, patients will receive lapatinib 750 mg daily in combination with trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV plus weekly paclitaxel 80mg/m\\^2 IV for a further 12 weeks, up to definitive surgery. After surgery, patients will receive three courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by the same targeted therapy as in the biological window of the neoadjuvant setting for a further 34 weeks (in the combination arm, lapatinib dose will be 1000 mg daily in combination with trastuzumab). The planned total duration of the anti-HER2 therapy one year.\n\nPrimary objective is to evaluate and compare the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) at the time of surgery in patients with HER2/ErbB2 overexpressing or amplified operable breast cancer randomised to lapatinib followed by lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus trastuzumab followed by trastuzumab plus paclitaxel versus lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab followed by lapatinib, trastuzumab plus paclitaxel.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR) at the Time of Surgery","timeFrame":"Weeks 20 to 22","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lapatinib 1500 mg","deltaMin":38,"sd":null},{"arm":"Trastuzumab 2 mg/kg","deltaMin":44,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lapatinib 1000/750 mg + Trastuzumab 2 mg/kg","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.3416"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":25,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":121,"countries":["Argentina","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Italy","Lithuania","Norway","Pakistan","Peru","Romania","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39613746","35610260","34921525","29902299","27684533","26181252","25851628","25130998","22785351","22257673"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":61,"n":149},"commonTop":["DIARRHOEA","ALOPECIA","NAUSEA","RASH","VOMITING"]}}
