In Part 1, eligible study participants will be assigned to receive either pexidartinib or matching placebo for 24 weeks. A number of assessments will be carried out during the course of the study, including physical examinations, blood tests, imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. MRI scans will be used to evaluate the response of the tumors to the treatment. Some subjects, assigned to placebo in Part 1 transitioned to pexidartinib for Part 2.\n\nThen a protocol amendment was written to allow only pexidartinib patients to continue into Part 2. Part 2 is a long-term treatment phase in which all participants receive open-label pexidartinib. There was also a follow-up period added to Part 2.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic, Locally Advanced Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT) Achieving Complete or Partial Response to Pexidartinib Compared With That of Placebo Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 at Week 25","timeFrame":"Week 25","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pexidartinib Part 1","deltaMin":14.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Part 1","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Denmark","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36001000","33289960","32755241","31229240","27041409"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":61},"commonTop":["Hair color changes","Fatigue","Nausea","Arthralgia","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
