For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs (e.g. rituximab, infliximab, etc.) within 6 months before study start, or planned administration during the study.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the study vaccination and during the entire study period.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting 3 months before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Administration of an influenza vaccine within the 6 months preceding the study start or planned use of such vaccines during the study period..\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within the six months preceding the study vaccination.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F, measured by any means.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.\n* Chronic underlying disease (such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease under oxygen therapy, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), not stabilised or clinically serious.\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.\n* History of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine, including latex.\n* History of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination.\n* Anaphylaxis following the administration of vaccine(s).\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Humoral Immune Response for Each Vaccine Strain in Terms of Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titers.","description":"Antibody titers were expressed as Geometric mean titers (GMTs).
