This will be a randomized clinical trial and patients will receive either two different doses of IV sodium nitrite (45 mg or 60 mg) or placebo during resuscitation in the field by paramedics. The primary outcome will be proportion of patients surviving to hospital admission.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Survived to Hospital Admission","timeFrame":"within 24 hours after out of hospital cardiac arrest","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":218,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sodium Nitrite 45 mg","deltaMin":205,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sodium Nitrite 60 mg","deltaMin":212,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.82"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.66"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33433575"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":280,"n":496},"commonTop":["Positive troponin"]}}
