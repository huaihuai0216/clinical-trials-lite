confirmed invasive breast cancer\n\n  * pT1-3; pNX, pN0-2 or pN3\\*; M0\n  * Neoadjuvant patients are eligible no earlier than 3 weeks or later than 3 months after excisional surgery, provided both the clinical-diagnostic staging of cancer and postsurgical resection-pathologic staging of cancer meet the requirements for primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis classification NOTE: \\*Only when the sole basis for this classification is the presence of 10 or more involved axillary lymph nodes\n* Completely resected disease\n\n  * Primary surgery performed at least 3 weeks but no more than 3 months before study entry (if no chemotherapy was given)\n\n    * Primary surgery is defined as the last surgery at which histologic evidence of invasive or in situ disease was present in the pathology specimen\n  * Patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy are eligible provided they have had a subsequent axillary lymph node dissection\n* No metachronous breast cancer\n* Bilateral mammogram within the past 12 months unless initial surgery was a total mastectomy, in which case only a mammogram of the remaining breast is required\n* No metastases confirmed by 1 of the following methods:\n\n  * Bone scan\\* (required only if alkaline phosphatase is at least 2 times normal and/or there are symptoms of metastatic disease)\n  * Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan (required only if AST/ALT or alkaline phosphatase is at least 2 times normal, unless the elevation is in the bone fraction)\n  * Chest x-ray NOTE: \\*Confirmatory x-ray, CT scan, or MRI required if the bone scan results are questionable\n* No locally recurrent disease\n* No prior or concurrent carcinoma in situ of the contralateral breast treated with partial mastectomy and/or hormonal therapy\n\n  * Patients with prior or concurrent carcinoma in situ of the ipsilateral breast are eligible provided the tumor was completely excised AND they have not received prior hormonal therapy\n* Hormone receptor status:\n\n  * Estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive by immunohistochemistry or tumor receptor content ≥ 10 fmol/mg protein\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\nAge\n\n* Postmenopausal\n\nSex\n\n* Female\n\nMenopausal status\n\n* Postmenopausal prior to chemotherapy, defined as 1 of the following:\n\n  * Over 60 years of age\n  * Age 45-59 with spontaneous cessation of menses for more than 1 year prior to study entry\n  * Age 45-59 with menses ceasing (secondary to hysterectomy or spontaneously) within the past year AND a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level prior to study entry in the postmenopausal range\\*\n  * Age 45-59, previously on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and have discontinued HRT upon diagnosis of this malignancy AND has an FSH level prior to study entry in the postmenopausal range\\*\n  * Has undergone bilateral oophorectomy NOTE: \\*By institutional standards OR \\> 34.4 IU/L if institutional range is not available)\n\nPerformance status\n\n* ECOG 0-2\n\nLife expectancy\n\n* At least 5 years\n\nHematopoietic\n\n* WBC at least 3,000/mm\\^3 OR\n* Granulocyte count at least 1,500/mm\\^3 AND\n* Platelet count at least 100,000/mm\\^3\n\nHepatic\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* AST and/or ALT less than 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN)\\*\n* Alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times ULN\\* NOTE: \\*Unless imaging examinations have ruled out metastatic disease\n\nRenal\n\n* Not specified\n\nOther\n\n* Able to swallow study medication and have adequate unassisted oral intake in order to maintain reasonable nutrition status\n* No other non-breast malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other curatively treated solid tumors with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years\n* No other concurrent medical or psychiatric condition that would preclude study participation and/or interfere with results\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\nBiologic therapy\n\n* Prior and concurrent trastuzumab (Herceptin®) allowed\n\nChemotherapy\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* At least 3 weeks but no more than 3 months since prior chemotherapy\n* Prior adjuvant chemotherapy allowed\n\nEndocrine therapy\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* No prior aromatase inhibitor\n* No prior tamoxifen or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) except raloxifene\n\n  * At least 3 weeks since prior raloxifene\n* At least 3 weeks since prior and no concurrent over-the-counter products or supplements considered to have an estrogenic effect, including any of the following:\n\n  * Ginseng\n  * Ginkgo biloba\n  * Black cohosh\n  * Dong quai\n  * Fortified soy supplements (e.g., phytoestrogen preparations)\n* At least 3 weeks since other prior hormonal therapy or steroids considered to have an estrogenic effect\n* No concurrent estrogens, progesterones, androgens, or SERMs\n\n  * Concurrent intermittent vaginal estrogens (e.g., vagifem, estrogen vaginal cream, testosterone, estradiol vaginal gel, or Estring) allowed if other local measures for intractable vaginal atrophy are insufficient\n* No other concurrent therapy that would have an estrogenic effect, including endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy, or steroid therapy\n\nRadiotherapy\n\n* See Disease Characteristics\n* Prior adjuvant radiotherapy allowed\n* Concurrent radiotherapy allowed\n\nSurgery\n\n* See Disease Characteristics","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"18
