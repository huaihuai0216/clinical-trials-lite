Home seated mean SBP 130-154 mmHg in the week before the randomization visit.\n2. Adherence of 80-120% to placebo run-in.\n3. Tolerated placebo run-in.\n4. Adherence to home BP monitoring schedule: in the week before randomization, at least 6 measures (e.g. ≥2 sets of triplicate measures) including at least 1 morning and 1 evening each with ≥2 measures.

Acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal prescription oral contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device, double-barrier method (e.g. condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal foam, cream, or gel), or male partner sterilization.

Current/history of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>3 times the upper limit of normal range within 6 months.\n13. Current concomitant illness or physical impairment or mental condition that in the judgment of the investigator could interfere with the effective conduct of the trial or constitutes a significant risk to the participants' well-being.\n14. Arm circumference that is too large (\\>55 cm) or too small (\\<20 cm) to allow accurate measurement of BP.\n15. Currently taking or might need during the trial, a concomitant treatment which is known to interact significantly with the trial medication: digoxin, lithium, diabetics receiving aliskiren, moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors \\[e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole, diltiazem\\], simvastatin \\>20 mg/day, immunosuppressants.\n16. Might need treatment with drugs that are prohibited during the trial: other antihypertensive drugs, endothelin receptor antagonists, neprilysin inhibitors, or other drugs that may affect BP (see Error! Reference source not found.).\n17. Current surgical or medical condition that might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of trial drugs such as prior major gastrointestinal tract surgery (e.g. gastrectomy, lap band, or bowel resection) or acute flare of inflammatory bowel disease within one year.\n18. Individuals working \\>2-night shifts per week.\n19. Participated in any investigational drug or device trial within the previous 30 days.\n20. History of alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months.\n\nAt randomization visit:\n\n1. Unable to adhere to the trial procedures during the run-in period.\n2. Any of the following which in the investigator's judgment may compromise the safety of the participant if randomized to the trial medications:\n\n   1. High or low clinic BP levels even in the light of the values for home BP that are available for that participant. The exact levels of BP are not specified, since there is clinical uncertainty as to the relevance of BP levels which are high/low in clinic only; for example the clinical relevance of 'whitecoat hypertension' is uncertain.\n   2. High or low home DBP levels. The exact levels of DBP are not specified, reflecting clinical uncertainty of for example isolated diastolic hypertension. However, home DBP values of \\>99 mmHg may typically be considered as requiring treatment intensification, and such participants would not be suitable for randomization.\n3. Any abnormal laboratory value which in the judgment of the investigator could interfere with the effective conduct of the trial or constitutes a significant risk to the participants' well-being.\n4. Fulfilling any of the exclusion criteria mentioned for the screening visit, when verified again at randomization visit.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Difference in Change in Home Seated Mean Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) From Randomization to Week 4","description":"Each blood pressure (BP) measurement consisted of valid SBP values (ie.
