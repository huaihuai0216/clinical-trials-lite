Where parent(s)/LAR(s) were illiterate, the consent form was countersigned by an independent witness.\n* Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.\n* Previously received three documented doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis, hepatitis B vaccine (DTPwHepB), and a 3-dose course of oral polio vaccine and, if locally recommended, pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Child in care\n* Use of a drug or vaccine that is not approved for that indication other than the study vaccines within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this meant prednisone≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids were allowed.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting seven days before the first dose of SB257049 measles, rubella and YF vaccines and ending 42 days after the last dose of vaccines given at 9 months of age (Visit 4), with the exception of oral polio vaccine which could be given for unforeseen public health threat.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product.\n* Previous vaccination against measles, YF or rubella.\n* Previous administration of Vitamin A.\n* Moderate or severe malnutrition at screening defined as weight for age Z-score \\< -2.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine(s). See also Section 1.3.\n* Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.\n* History of any neurological disorders or seizures.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever was defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study was axillary.\n\nSubjects with a minor illness without fever might have been enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Same sex twin.\n* Maternal death.\n* Previous participation in any other malaria study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Months","maximumAge":"6 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Anti-Circumsporozoite (Anti-CS) Antibody Concentrations, One Month Post Dose 3 of SB257049 (Primary Analysis)","description":"Concentrations were expressed as Geometric Mean Concentrations (GMCs) with the following unit of measure: Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) units per milliliter (EU/mL).
