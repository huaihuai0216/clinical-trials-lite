With the translabial technique at an angle of 70 degrees or more, the entire levator hiatus and surrounding muscles (pubococcygeus and puborectalis) can be visualized. It is hoped that ultrasound is more reproducible because axial measurements are easier with minimal dimensional images, at rest, valsalva, or contraction.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.64","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.35","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22.35","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.41","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.54","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Changes in Pelvic Floor Muscle Contraction","description":"Changes in pelvic floor muscle contraction in various measurements (compared to baseline), measured using perineometer","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37.45","spread":"13.89"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"41.45","spread":"18.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"28.94","spread":"16.49"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28.79","spread":"15.86"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35.84","spread":"18.81"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.88","spread":"18.33"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":29},"commonTop":[]}}}
