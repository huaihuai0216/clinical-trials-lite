Those patients who also have respiratory failure and obstructive sleep apnoea are at higher risk of exacerbations and death and have worse health related quality of life than similar COPD patients without respiratory failure.\n\nTreatment options in this group of patients have been limited and data to support the use of machines to assist breathing (non-invasive ventilators) in stable patients are limited. A major limitation of these devices has been patient acceptance and achieving sufficient control of sleep breathing disturbance.\n\nCurrently devices are set at a fixed pressure to support the breathing throughout the night. The new software within the trial device will aim to better match the support provided by the machine to that needed by the patient. It is hoped that this may offer enhanced comfort as well as superior control of respiratory failure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Control of Nocturnal Hypoventilation","timeFrame":"baseline, 6 week assessment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":6.5,"sd":1.6},{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":6.7,"sd":1.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
