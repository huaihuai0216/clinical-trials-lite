Abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula at the back of the eye, and also leak blood and fluid, which damages and scars the macula, affecting vision. The current standard of care for patients with neovascular (exudative / wet) AMD is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, which prevents or slows down the growth of the abnormal blood vessels. SCD411 is being developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Eylea速 (aflibercept), an anti-VEGF drug. The study aims to prove equivalence of SCD411 to Eylea in adults with wet AMD, and will look at safety, tolerance, effectiveness, immune response and the movement of the drug through the body.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in BCVA (Best Corrected Visual Acuity)","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SCD411","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Aflibercept","deltaMin":5.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":30},"locations":{"siteCount":130,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bulgaria","Czechia","Hungary","India","Israel","Japan","Latvia","Poland","Russia","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/default.htm","http://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":32,"n":287},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Neovascular age-related macular degeneration","Visual acuity reduced","Back pain","Urinary tract infection"]}}
