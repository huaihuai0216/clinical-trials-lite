Participant-Reported health status individually The KCCQ (23-item version) is a patient-reported questionnaire that measures the impact of patients' CV disease or its treatment on 6 distinct domains using a 2-week recall: symptoms/signs, physical limitations, quality of life, social limitations, self-efficacy, and symptom stability (Green et al., 2000). In addition to the individual domains, 2 summary scores can be calculated from the KCCQ: the overall summary score (includes the total symptom, physical limitation, social limitations and quality of life scores) and the clinical summary score (combines the total symptom and physical limitation scales). Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better health status. The KCCQ will be administered to participants as indicated.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.99","spread":"2.063"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.25","spread":"2.750"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 30 in N-terminal Pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP)","description":"To compare the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten on cardiac biomarkers","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.182","spread":"0.1743"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.932","spread":"0.5133"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 30 in Cardiac Troponin","description":"To compare the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten on cardiac biomarkers","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.419","spread":"0.1983"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.236","spread":"0.6528"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 30 in Left Ventricular (LV) Mass Index","description":"To compare the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten with placebo on LV mass evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-26.365","spread":"21.0565"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.434","spread":"14.4226"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Upper respiratory tract infection","Hyperuricemia","Dizziness","Defect conduction intraventricular"]}}}
