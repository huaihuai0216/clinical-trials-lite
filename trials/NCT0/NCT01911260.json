Children's heights were measured at the End of Supplementation period and again after 12 weeks (Follow-up period). In combination with sex and age we transformed stature to Height-for-Age, expressed in Z-score, which was calculated as a number of standard deviations or Z-scores below or above the reference mean or median value, according to the formula below:\n\nZ-score = (observed value - median value of the reference population) / standard deviation value of reference population.\n\nWe analyzed and discussed the change in HAZ (HAZ at the End of Follow-up period - HAZ at End of Supplementation).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.04","spread":"0.12"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.08","spread":"0.45"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.10","spread":"0.15"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.02","spread":"0.26"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":["Gastrointestinal event"]}}}
