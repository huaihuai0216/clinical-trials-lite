The analysis population included all randomized participants without deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the immunogenicity endpoint.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"90.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"96.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"83.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"95.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"89.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"88.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"96.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"96.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"100.0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"88.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"94.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Meeting Serotype-specific IgG Threshold Value of ≥0.35 μg/mL for Each of the 15 Serotypes - Schedule C: 2-17 Years","description":"Sera from participants was used to measure vaccine-induced anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG for all the 15 serotypes using PnECL assay.
