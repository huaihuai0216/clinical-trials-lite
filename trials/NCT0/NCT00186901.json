Z-scores from 0 to +2 are considered normal, above +2 are considered to be elevated, from 0 to -1 are considered to represent a mild BMD deficit, between -1 and -2 are considered to represent moderate deficits, and below -2 are considered to represent severe deficits.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.95","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.97","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.87","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.04","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.72","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.76","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.56","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.61","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Bone Mineral Density in Male and Female ALL Survivors","description":"Using bone mineral density Z-score, assess relationship between predisposing factors (gender) and bone mineral density;
