The SI must review the above pathology report or flow cytometry report results (including bone marrow aspirate analysis and CD5 and CD20 results) by fax, prior to registration, to confirm each patient's eligibility. Results should be consistent with typical B-cell CLL. If Dr. Reynolds is not available to review these documents, they must be reviewed by Dr. Nicholas J.
