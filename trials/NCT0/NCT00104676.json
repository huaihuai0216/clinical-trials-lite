Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different combination chemotherapy regimens to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II or stage III non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival Rate After 1 Course of Treatment","timeFrame":"3 years from randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I","deltaMin":48,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II","deltaMin":59,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["United States","France","Slovakia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39167741","25456363"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":37,"n":98},"commonTop":["Hemoglobin","Asthenia","Nausea","Granulocytes","Platelets"]}}
