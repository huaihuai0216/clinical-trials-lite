This study will be a phase III, multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled study that takes place in emergency departments. The primary aim of this study is to determine the proportion of patients in which pain control was not achieved by 48 hours post treatment. Secondary aims are as follows: 1) a reduction in pain intensity at the end of the treatment phase compared to baseline; 2) the proportion of patients with a clinically significant decrease in pain intensity at 30 minutes post-treatment; 3) the proportion of patients in which drug-related adverse events occurred; and 4) to determine if serious, drug-related adverse events in Analatro-treated patients occurred at a rate greater than one in 10 (10%).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment Failure","timeFrame":"From start of Dose 1 infusion to 48 hours post treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Antivenin Latrodectus (Black Widow) Equine Immune F(ab)2","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Normal Saline","deltaMin":24,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0185"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30926190"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":29},"commonTop":["Pruritus","Arthralgia","Rash","Chills","Headache"]}}
