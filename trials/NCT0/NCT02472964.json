Archival tumor tissue samples can be used.\n\nPathologically confirmed breast cancer with at least one measurable metastatic target lesion (based on RECIST criteria, version 1.1). Bone, central nervous system (CNS), and skin lesions, as well as lesions that were irradiated, biopsied or had any form of local intervention or surgical manipulation are only to be assessed as non-target lesions.\n\nPatients previously treated with trastuzumab or lapatinib in the adjuvant setting are allowed if metastatic disease was diagnosed at least one year after the last dose of treatment.\n\nPrior treatment with hormonal agents or bisphosphonates/denosumab is allowed. Bisphosphonates/denosumab can be given simultaneously with study treatment but cannot start after randomization and is considered an indication of progressive disease (PD). Hormonal agents must be discontinued prior to beginning study therapy.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 - 2\n\n* Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal),\n* Total bilirubin ≤1.0 x ULN (\\>1.0 x ULN if documented Gilbert's disease),\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN,\n* AST and/or ALT \\<1.5 x ULN if alkaline phosphatase \\>2.5 x ULN,\n* Alkaline phosphatase \\>2.5 x ULN;if bone metastases present and no liver dysfunction present.\n\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) within institutional range of normal as measured by multiple gated acquisition scan or echocardiogram.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPrior systemic therapy in the metastatic disease setting. This includes: chemotherapy, signal transduction inhibitors (e.g., lapatinib), HER2 targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab), or other investigational anticancer therapy.\n\nPrior treatment with neoadjuvant or adjuvant anthracyclines with a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of \\>400 mg/m2, epirubicin dose \\>800 mg/m2.\n\nPatients with bone or skin as the only site of disease. Patients with skin lesions measurable by CT scans or MRI as only site of measurable disease are allowed.\n\nSurgery or radiotherapy ≤2 weeks preceding Day 1. Target lesions have to be outside the irradiated fields and the patient has fully recovered from surgery or radiotherapy.\n\nPresence of unstable angina or a history of congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association criteria, history of myocardial infarction \\<1 year from randomization, clinically significant valvular disease, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, uncontrolled hypertension or known pulmonary hypertension.\n\nPeripheral sensory or motor neuropathy Grade 2 or higher according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) Version 4.03 \\[19\\].\n\nAny other cancer, including contralateral breast cancer, within 5 years prior to screening with the exception of adequately treated ductal carcinoma in situ, adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n\nImmunocompromized patients, including known seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus, or current or chronic hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection (as detected by positive testing for hepatitis B surface antigen or antibody to hepatitis C virus with confirmatory testing).\n\nComplete listing of Inc/Excl. within protocol","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Primary Endpoint : Compare Best Overall Response Rate (ORR) (According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor [RECIST] 1.1 Criteria) at Week 24 of MYL-1401O Plus Taxane Versus Herceptin® Plus Taxane in the ITT1 Population","description":"Tumor measurements were perform by centralized blinded reviewers using RECIST 1.1 criteria.
