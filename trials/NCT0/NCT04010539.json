Baseline (Day 1) was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"296","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"305","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"284","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"283","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"288","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"300","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"279","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"279","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"202","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"192","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"77","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"91","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"251","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"252","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"212","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"210","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"79","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"83","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"239","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"244","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Absolute Values in Specific Gravity of Urine","description":"Urine samples were collected from participants to assess urine specific gravity.
