The purpose of uridine triacetate administration is to provide an exogenous source of uridine. Therefore, plasma uridine levels were assessed at various time points (prior to dosing, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours) following uridine triacetate dosing to ensure levels of uridine consistent with previously observed symptomatic improvement from administration of uridine were achieved.
