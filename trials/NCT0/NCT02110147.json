The purpose of this study is to replace oral administration of uridine with oral administration of uridine triacetate in patients with hereditary orotic aciduria who have received (or would reasonably be expected to receive) clinical benefit from treatment with exogenous uridine. It is also to document the continued clinical benefit of exogenous uridine when patients are switched from oral administration of uridine to oral administration of uridine triacetate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Patients With Stable Predetermined Principal Hematologic Parameters","timeFrame":"Days 28 and 42","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Uridine Triacetate","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":4},"commonTop":[]}}
