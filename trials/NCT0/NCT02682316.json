The Prevena Incision Management System is a type of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). NPWT is a portable vacuum device made of a sponge-like foam that is applied over your incision to help draw fluid and debris out after surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Post-op Wound Complications","timeFrame":"30 days +/- 5 days after surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Standard Dry Gauze Used for Wound Management","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Prevena Negative Pressure Wound Therapy System (NPWT)","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33416292"],"seeAlso":["https://www.mskcc.org/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":51,"n":251},"commonTop":["Skin blistering","Contact dermatitis","Wound pain","VAS pain level"]}}
