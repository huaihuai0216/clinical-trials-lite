The study will be considered completed when a minimum of 6 subjects (i.e., at least 3 subjects aged between 0 and \\<6 years and 3 subjects aged between 6 and \\<12 years) have at least one documented bleeding episode and when in total a minimum of 2 surgical procedures have been performed.\n\nAll patients will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) study after screening. This will have a duration of 14 days, after which a patient can be treated for a bleeding episode or planned surgical procedure when they occur.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Clinical Assessment of the Haemostatic Efficacy of Octafibrin in the On-demand Treatment of the First Documented Bleeding Episode of Each Patient Based on a 4-point Haemostatic Efficacy Scale","timeFrame":"First Octafibrin infusion for the treatment of a bleeding episode until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes last","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Investigator Assessment","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"IDMEAC Assessment","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["India","Iran","Lebanon"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":14},"commonTop":["Ecchymosis","Influenza-like illness","Pyrexia","Abdominal pain","Tonsillitis"]}}
