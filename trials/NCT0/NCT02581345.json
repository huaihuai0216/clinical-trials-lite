Overall Result: a participant was considered to be positive if a confirmed positive result was observed at any assay (including predose); if a participant had either a negative result in the screening assay or a positive result at screening followed by a negative result in all confirmation tiers, the overall result was negative. Overall Status: a participant was considered to have developed ADA or neutralizing ADAs if a confirmed positive result was observed at any time during the treatment period inclusive of the predose results; the designation of negative required either a negative screening assay or a negative confirmation result at each sampling time. In confirmed positive samples, an assay was used to determine the relative titer of the ADA; a subsequent neutralizing antibodies assay was used to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"62","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"38","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"15","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Median Time to Seroconversion","description":"Time to seroconversion (in days) was defined as the time to the observation of the first confirmed positive ADA response.
