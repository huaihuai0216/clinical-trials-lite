Delirium occurs commonly (10% to 70%) in patients older than 60 undergoing large surgeries. The purpose of this study is to test rigorously whether a drug called ketamine can decrease the chance that patients will experience delirium after their surgery. The investigators are also testing whether ketamine decreases postoperative pain, postoperative opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, ICU and hospital length of stay, and adverse outcomes (e.g. hallucinations and nightmares).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Incidence of Delirium Across All Patients at Baseline and Over Post-operative Days 1-3","timeFrame":"Delirium incidence on postoperative days 1-3, calculated by any positive CAM on any day for all patients","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ketamine (0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg)","deltaMin":85,"sd":null},{"arm":"Normal Saline (Placebo)","deltaMin":43,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.912"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"60 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25231491","28576285","30768457","30336852"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":227},"commonTop":["Atrial Fibriliation","Anaemia/Bleeding","Infection","Renal","Hypotension"]}}
