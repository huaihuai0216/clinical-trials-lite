Participants will receive either study drug or placebo. Participants will self-report any new or worsening symptoms or medical events experienced while taking study drug or placebo. This study is intended to be all remote with no in person visits, unless the study team feels it is in the best interest of a participant to be seen in person.\n\nPrior and current drug arms are listed on clinicaltrials.gov and will be updated with the activation of any new drug arms. Each study arm will also have its own clinicaltrials.gov entry and will include \"Pro00107921\" in the Unique Protocol ID.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Sustained Recovery in Days","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm G - Metformin","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm G - Placebo","deltaMin":10,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":110,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":1443},"commonTop":["Hypoglycemia","Hypoxia","Hypoglycaemic episode","Hypoglycemia, unspecified"]}}
