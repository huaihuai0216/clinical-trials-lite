Among existing therapies, viscosupplementation, i.e., the injection of hyaluronic acid into the joint, has an established place in the symptomatic treatment of knee OA.\n\nThe present Phase IIb/III aiming to assess the safety and efficacy of JTA-004 is organized in two phases. With results obtained in the first phase the best dose of JTA-004 is determined, and the efficacy of the selected dose will then be confirmed in the second phase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in WOMAC VA3.1 Pain Subscale Score at Month 6","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"JTA-004 100 (2 mL)","deltaMin":-23.6,"sd":4.6},{"arm":"Reference Product","deltaMin":-14.1,"sd":4.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.141"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["34666767"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":41},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Injection Site Pain","Procedural hypotension","Osteoarthritis","Fatigue"]}}
