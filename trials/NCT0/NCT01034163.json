Primary objective as stated above reflects a change from the original protocol as of an amendment. The original objective was no longer feasible with only 41 of 367 patients randomized after the study was halted due to poor recruitment. An amendment was written to allow patients on panobinostat to continue their treatment until discontinuation/completion criteria were met (patients were unblinded). Therefore, the study was completed as per this amendment. No secondary objectives were included for this trial from the amendment; this was a change from the original protocol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","timeFrame":"23 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Panobinostat (PAN)","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Netherlands","New Zealand","Poland","Russia","Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":26},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Vomiting","Fatigue","Neutropenia"]}}
