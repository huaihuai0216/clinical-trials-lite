Men older than 65 years may be enrolled if they have a BMD T-score ≤ -2.0 even if they do not meet the fracture criteria.\n* Normal medical history, physical examination, including vital signs, and body mass index.\n* Hypogonadal participants whose doses of androgens have been stable for at least twelve months before randomization are eligible and may continue therapy during the study.\n* Laboratory tests within the normal range including serum calcium (albumin-corrected), parathyroid hormone, serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase, and thyroid stimulating hormone values.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Presence of abnormalities of the lumbar spine that would prohibit assessment of spinal BMD, defined as having at least 2 radiologically evaluable vertebrae within L1-L4.\n* A BMD T-score of ≤-3.5 at the total hip, femoral neck, or lumbar spine based on female or male reference range (depending on date of enrollment).\n* Unevaluable hip BMD or participants who have undergone bilateral hip replacement.\n* Fragility fracture within the prior twelve months.\n* History of severe vertebral fracture or \\>2 moderate vertebral fractures.\n* History of bone disorders (for example, Paget's disease) other than osteoporosis.\n* participant with clinical signs of hypogonadism present at screening who plan to initiate testosterone replacement.\n* History of prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton other than radioiodine.\n* History of chronic or recurrent renal, hepatic, pulmonary, allergic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, central nervous system, hematologic or metabolic diseases, or immunologic, emotional and/or psychiatric disturbances to a degree that would interfere with the interpretation of study data or compromise the safety of the participant.\n* History of Cushing's disease, growth hormone deficiency or excess, hyperthyroidism, hypo- or hyperparathyroidism or malabsorptive syndromes within the past year.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine BMD at Month 12","description":"Lumbar Spine BMD was assessed by DXA scans evaluated by a central imaging laboratory.
