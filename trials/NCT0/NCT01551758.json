Type of subject: Subjects with documented GP diagnosis of COPD, and currently receiving maintenance therapy\n2. Informed consent: Subjects must be able to provide informed consent, have their consent signed and dated. Subjects must be able to complete the electronic subject questionnaires or allow a proxy to do so on their behalf.\n3. Gender and Age: Male or female subjects aged ≥40 years of age at Visit 1 A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Post-menopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms. However in questionable cases, a blood sample with FSH \\> 40MIU/ml and estradiol \\<40pg/ml (\\<140 pmol/L) is confirmatory. Or child bearing potential has a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 2, and agrees to one of the highly effective and acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e. in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study - Visit 2 to the end of the study).\n4. Subjects with Exacerbation History\n5. Current COPD Maintenance Therapy\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:\n\n1. Subjects with any life threatening condition (e.g. low probability (in the opinion of the GP/Investigator) of 12 month survival due to severity of COPD or co-morbid condition) at the point of entry into the study.\n2. Other diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of uncontrolled or clinically significant disease. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the GP/ Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.\n3. Subjects with unstable COPD, defined as the occurrence of the following in the 2 weeks prior to Visit 2:\n\n   \\- Acute worsening of COPD that is managed by the subject with corticosteroids or antibiotics or that requires treatment prescribed by a physician.\n4. Chronic user of oral corticosteroids: Subjects who, in the opinion of the GP/Investigator, are considered to be a chronic user of oral corticosteroids for respiratory or other indications (if unsure discuss with the medical monitor prior to screening)\n5. Drug/food allergy: Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study medications (e.g., beta-agonists, corticosteroid) or components of the inhalation powder (e.g., lactose, magnesium stearate). In addition, subjects with a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the GP/ Investigator, contraindicates the subject's participation will also be excluded.\n6. Investigational Medications: A subject must not have used any investigational drug treatment within 30 days prior to Visit 2 or within five half-lives (t½) of the prior investigational study (whichever is the longer of the two).\n7. Subjects who plan to move away from the geographical area where the study is being conducted during the study period and/or if subjects have not consented to their medical records being part of the electronic medical records database that is operational in the Salford area.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Annual Rate of Moderate or Severe COPD Exacerbations","description":"Mean annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during treatment were assessed.
