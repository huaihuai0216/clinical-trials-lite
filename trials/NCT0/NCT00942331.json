Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with bevacizumab, may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin are more effective when given with or without bevacizumab in treating patients with urinary tract cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"From date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 7 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm II (GCB)","deltaMin":14.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm I (GCP)","deltaMin":14.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1707"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":20,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":873,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40591902","40256659","33989025"],"seeAlso":["http://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":95,"n":237},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Hemoglobin decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Platelet count decreased","Creatinine increased"]}}
