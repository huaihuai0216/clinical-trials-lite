The goal is to determine if each laser system is effective at reducing the amount of hair on the lower legs or the axilla (arm pit). Another goal is determine the subject's perspective on the treatment including tolerability and effectiveness.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Hair Growth","timeFrame":"1 month, 6 month, 12 month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Soprano/SHR","deltaMin":57.6,"sd":34.03},{"arm":"LightSheer","deltaMin":52.1,"sd":32.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.2879"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.dermatology.uci.edu/clinical_research.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["Burn"]}}
