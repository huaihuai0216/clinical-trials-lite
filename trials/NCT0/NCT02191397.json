The total duration of the study will be 11 weeks consisting of three phases. The screening phase (phase I) will be lasting for 0-14 days, subjects will be randomised to bupropion XL or escitalopram in a 1:1 ratio for acute phase treatment phase (phase II) for 8 weeks. There are 3 dose levels during this acute treatment phase. The 3-dose level plan is designed to ensure each drug is titrated according to the prescribing information and to reach an optimal clinical dose. Finally patients will enter the taper phase (phase III) for up to 1 week to assess and reduce the possible withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIn China almost all existing antidepressants are available on the market, but bupropion XL has not yet been approved. This Phase III clinical trial will be used for the purpose of registering bupropion XL in China.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale - 17 (HAMD-17) Total Score From Baseline to End of Acute Treatment Phase (Week 8)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bupropion XL","deltaMin":-14.5,"sd":0.41},{"arm":"Escitalopram","deltaMin":-15.4,"sd":0.39}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.139"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31301615"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":266},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dizziness","Headache","Dry mouth","Viral upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
