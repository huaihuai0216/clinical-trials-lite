Able to understand and comply with study procedures required and able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures being performed\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n1. Baseline endoscopy showing any gastric, esophageal or duodenal ulcer at least 3 mm in diameter with depth\n2. Positive test result for H. pylori at screening 3A. Have had a revascularization procedure (i.e., Coronary Artery Bypass Graft, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, or carotid endarterectomy) less than six months prior to screening\n\n4\\. Unstable hypertension as judged by the Investigator 5. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as judged by the Investigator 6. Unstable cardio- or cerebrovascular disease such that it would endanger the subject if they participated in the trial 7. Clinically significant valvular disease 8. Congestive heart failure or other cardiovascular symptoms according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification III or IV (Appendix 3) 9. History of hypersensitivity to omeprazole or to another proton pump inhibitor 10.

History of serious UGI event, such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction 12. Gastrointestinal disorder or surgery leading to impaired drug absorption 13. Presence of chronic or uncontrolled acute medical illness, e.g. gastrointestinal disorder (esophageal stricture, severe esophagitis, long-segment Barrett's esophagus, signs and symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction), thyroid disorder and/or infection that would endanger a subject if they were to participate in the study 14. Schizophrenia, uncontrolled bipolar disorder, or severe depression 15. History of alcoholism or drug addiction within a year prior to enrollment in the study 16. Severe hepatic dysfunction (i.e. cirrhosis or portal hypertension) 17. Blood coagulation disorder, including use of systemic anticoagulants such as warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists 18.

Screening laboratory ALT or AST value \\> two times the upper limit of normal 21A. History of renal insufficiency 22. Other than noted specifically, any screening laboratory value that is clinically significant in the Investigator's opinion and would endanger a subject if the subject was to participate in the study 23. Use of an investigational treatment in the 4 weeks before screening 24. History of malignancy, treated or untreated, within the past five years, with the exception of successfully treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 25.
