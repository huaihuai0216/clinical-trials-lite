The additional effect of mixtures of amino acids excluding tyrosine will be explored to take advantage of protein synthesis to avoid elevations of tyrosine that would otherwise limit the optimal dosage of nitisinone. The study is designed to treat patients and find the optimal dosage of nitisinone to obtain maximal reduction in levels of homogentisic acid and maintain safe levels of tyrosine.\n\nThe long term objective in the target population of pre-symptomatic patients is the prevention of the characteristic effects on joint cartilage and tendons.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Homogentisic Acid Excretion","timeFrame":"3-6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HGA, Baseline","deltaMin":1425.9,"sd":678.3},{"arm":"HGA, 2 mg/d Nitisinone","deltaMin":113.1,"sd":70.9},{"arm":"HGA, 4 mg Nitisinone","deltaMin":34,"sd":12.9}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15931605","21620748","12501223","25680927","25665838"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":7},"commonTop":["Ocular irritation","Abdominal discomfort"]}}
