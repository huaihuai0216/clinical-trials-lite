Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection Study Consortium. Participants will be enrolled for 96 weeks. Clinical care and study drug (ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF) will be provided for the first 48 weeks. After week 48, clinical care but not study drug will be provided through week 96. A study participant suppressed at week 48 can continue on FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF.\n\nThe primary hypothesis is that once daily fixed-dose combination elvitegravir (ELV), cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) will rapidly reduce viral replication to \\<50 copies RNA/ml in participants with acute HIV infection. The secondary hypotheses to be considered are 1) virologic response rates as measured by plasma HIV RNA levels will be non-inferior or superior to a historical group of participants from the PHI cohort treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, 2) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, plasma HIV RNA will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF, 3) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, immune activation as measured by the proportion CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CD38+ will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF, 4)in a subset of participants samples will be obtained from compartments such as the gastrointestinal tract, and lymphoid tissues to assess changes over time in parameters such as HIV-1 RNA, immunologic responses to HIV, and tissue and anatomic reservoirs. We hypothesize that treatment with the ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will demonstrate improved viral clearance in these compartments as compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. 5) in a subset of participants who remain suppressed on therapy, resting CD4 cells with replication-competent HIV-1 (latent reservoir) will be quantitated and compared to similar measurements in PHI participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. In addition, we will compare these results to those measured in HIV-1 infected participants treated and 6) ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will be well tolerated, and the proportion of participants who require treatment modification will be less than that observed in participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Viral Load Measurement of <200 Copies/mL at Week 24","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Quad FDC","deltaMin":28,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21487250"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":33},"commonTop":["Elevated BP during leukapheresis","Headache","Diarrhea","Nausea","Elevated AST"]}}
