Please Note:\n\n  * Inactivated influenza (Flu) vaccine and monovalent Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib) vaccines may be given at any time, including the day of study vaccination (Flu and Hib vaccines must be administered at a different location than the study vaccine/s).\n  * Any other age appropriate vaccine may be given starting at Visit 2 and anytime thereafter.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting 180 days before the study vaccination at Visit 1 or planned administration from the date of vaccination through the immunogenicity evaluation at Visit 2.\n* History of measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster and/or hepatitis A disease.\n* Known exposure to measles, mumps, rubella and/or varicella/zoster during the period starting within 30 days prior to first study vaccination.\n* Previous vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A and/or varicella virus.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).\n* Blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic systems.\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccines, including hypersensitivity to neomycin, latex or gelatin.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrollment. (Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever). Fever is defined as temperature ≥38.0°C/100.4°F by any age appropriate route. All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection without fever.\n* Active untreated tuberculosis based on medical history.\n* Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the child from participating in the study.\n* For US children only: a child that previously received a fourth dose of PCV-13 vaccine.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"15 Months","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects Reporting Fever After MMR (Priorix or M-M-R II/M-M-R VaxPro [Lot 1 or Lot 2]) Vaccination","description":"Fever was assessed for temperature equal to/above (≥) 38.0°C and above (\\>) 39.0°C.
