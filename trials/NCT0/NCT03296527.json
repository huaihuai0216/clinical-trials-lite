Both ovaries must be accessible for oocyte retrieval.\n* Early follicular phase (cycle day 2-4) serum levels of FSH between 1 and 15 IU/L (results obtained within 3 months prior to randomization).\n* Negative serum Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody tests within 2 years prior to randomization.\n* Body mass index (BMI) between 17.5 and 32.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive) at screening.\n* Willing to accept transfer of 1-2 embryos.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known endometriosis stage III-IV (defined by the revised ASRM classification, 1996).\n* One or more follicles ≥10 mm (including cysts) observed on the transvaginal ultrasound prior to randomization on stimulation day 1 (puncture of cysts is allowed prior to randomization).\n* Known history of recurrent miscarriage (defined as three consecutive losses after ultrasound confirmation of pregnancy (excl. ectopic pregnancy) and before week 24 of pregnancy).\n* Known abnormal karyotype of participant or of her partner / sperm donor, as applicable, depending on source of sperm used for insemination in this trial.\n* Any known clinically significant systemic disease (e.g. insulin-dependent diabetes).\n* Known inherited or acquired thrombophilia disease.\n* Active arterial or venous thromboembolism or severe thrombophlebitis, or a history of these events.\n* Known porphyria.\n* Any known endocrine or metabolic abnormalities (pituitary, adrenal, pancreas, liver or kidney) with the exception of controlled thyroid function disease.\n* Known presence of anti-FSH antibodies (based on the information available in the participant's medical records; i.e. not based on the anti-FSH antibody analyses conducted in the trial).\n* Known tumours of the ovary, breast, uterus, adrenal gland, pituitary or hypothalamus which would contraindicate the use of gonadotropins.\n* Known moderate or severe impairment of renal or hepatic function.\n* Any abnormal finding of clinical chemistry, haematology or vital signs at screening which is clinically significant as judged by the investigator.\n* Currently breast-feeding.\n* Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.\n* Known abnormal cervical cytology of clinical significance observed within three years prior to randomization (unless the clinical significance has been resolved).\n* Findings at the gynaecological examination at screening which preclude gonadotropin stimulation or are associated with a reduced chance of pregnancy, e.g. congenital uterine abnormalities or retained intrauterine device.\n* Pregnancy (negative urinary pregnancy tests must be documented at screening and prior to randomization) or contraindication to pregnancy.\n* Known current active pelvic inflammatory disease.\n* Use of fertility modifiers during the last menstrual cycle before randomization, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), metformin or cycle programming with oral contraceptives, progestogen or estrogen preparations.\n* Use of hormonal preparations (except for thyroid medication) during the last menstrual cycle before randomization.\n* Known history of chemotherapy (except for gestational conditions) or radiotherapy.\n* Current or past (1 year prior to randomization) abuse of alcohol or drugs.\n* Current (last month) intake of more than 14 units of alcohol per week.\n* Current or past (3 months prior to randomization) smoking habit of more than 10 cigarettes per day.\n* Hypersensitivity to any active ingredient or excipients in the medicinal products used in the trial.\n* Previous participation in the trial.\n* Use of any non-registered investigational drugs during the last 3 months prior to randomization.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","genderBased":true,"minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Ongoing Pregnancy Rate","description":"Defined as at least one intrauterine viable fetus 10-11 weeks after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Positive Beta Unit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (βhCG) Rate","description":"Defined as positive βhCG test 13-15 days after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"35.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Clinical Pregnancy Rate","description":"Defined as at least one gestational sac 5-6 weeks after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"36.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Vital Pregnancy Rate","description":"Defined as at least one intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart beat 5-6 weeks after transfer.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Implantation Rate","description":"Defined as number of gestational sacs 5-6 weeks after transfer divided by number of embryos transferred.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Ongoing Implantation Rate","description":"Defined as number of intrauterine viable fetuses 10-11 weeks after transfer divided by number of embryos transferred.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Proportion of Subjects With Extreme Ovarian Responses","description":"Extreme ovarian response defined as \\<4, ≥15 or ≥ 20 oocytes retrieved.
