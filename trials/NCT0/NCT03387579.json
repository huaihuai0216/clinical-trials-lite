In the neonatal population, infants with history of intestinal resection and short bowel syndrome are at increased risk for this disease. The investigators plan to compare two possible lipid dosing preventative strategies including a composite, fish oil lipid and soy-based lipid reduction.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Cholestasis","timeFrame":"Patients were monitored during time enrolled in study for a maximum of up to 12 weeks or 84 days.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Smoflipid 20%","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intralipid 20% Reduction","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intralipid 20% Historic","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.590"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.224"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"1.00"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":12},"commonTop":["Anemia","Hypoalbuminemia","Elevated GGT","Hypophosphatemia","Hypoglycemia"]}}
