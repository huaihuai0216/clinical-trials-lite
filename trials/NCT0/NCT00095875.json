Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is most effective in treating head and neck cancer.\n\nPURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"3-years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I","deltaMin":73,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":38,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23414589"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":56,"n":70},"commonTop":["Xerostomia","Pain","Mucositis","Neuropathy"]}}
