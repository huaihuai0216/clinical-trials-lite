Since hyperglycaemia and hypertension are key risk factors for both micro- and macrovascular complications, assessment of both glucose and BP lowering effects of empagliflozin in hypertensive African American patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus could provide clinically highly relevant, new information for the use of empagliflozin.\n\nEssential hypertension is four times more common in African Americans than in Caucasians.\n\nOne of the risk factors for hypertension is sodium sensitivity and approximately one third of the essential hypertensive population is responsive to sodium intake. There is a higher association of hypertension with sodium sensitivity in African American patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.\n\nThe treatment duration of this trial (24 weeks) will enable assessment of the clinically relevant endpoint of a decrease in HbA1c, a well accepted measurement of chronic glycaemic control and the key secondary endpoints of decreases in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) at 12 and 24 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%) at 24 Weeks","timeFrame":"baseline and 24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.07,"sd":0.14},{"arm":"Empagliflozin 10 Mg-25mg","deltaMin":-0.71,"sd":0.14}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":92,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31923435","30786754","29139301"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":80},"commonTop":["Lipase increased","Cough","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
