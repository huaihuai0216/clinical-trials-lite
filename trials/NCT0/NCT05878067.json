This study will evaluate symptom relief and tolerability of ABBV-444 eye drops in adult participants.\n\nABBV-444 is being developed for the treatment of Dry Eye Disease (DED). This is a 30-day, open-label study to evaluate adult participant symptoms and tolerability of ABBV-444. Around 40 participants will be enrolled in 1 site in the United States.\n\nParticipants will receive 1-2 drops of ABBV-444 in each eye as needed but minimally twice a day for 30 days.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Day 30 in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score","timeFrame":"Baseline to Day 30","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ABBV-444","deltaMin":-6.8,"sd":15}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.abbvieclinicaltrials.com/study/?id=P24-203"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":[]}}
