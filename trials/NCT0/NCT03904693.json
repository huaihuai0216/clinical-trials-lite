Adherence to prescribed therapy has an impact on clinical outcomes. Reducing the pill/tablet count and frequency has a major impact on patients' adherence to therapies and therefore the observed clinical outcomes. One way to simplify treatment is to use fixed-dose combination (FDC) products that combine multiple treatments targeting different pathways into a single tablet.\n\nThis study aims to demonstrate that the FDC of macitentan and tadalafil is more effective than therapy with 10 mg of macitentan alone or 40 mg of tadalafil alone. This phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety at 16 weeks of an FDC (macitentan 10 mg and tadalafil 40 mg) against these two PAH-approved therapies given as monotherapy to further confirm the added value of the FDC.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) Expressed as the Ratio of Geometric Means of End of Double-blind Treatment (EDBT) to Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline, EDBT (up to 16 weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment-naive And Prior ERA Strata: Macitentan 10 Milligrams (mg)","deltaMin":0.77,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment-naive And Prior ERA Strata: M/T FDC","deltaMin":0.55,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment-naive And Prior PDE-5i Strata: Tadalafil 20 mg","deltaMin":0.78,"sd":null},{"arm":"Treatment-naive And Prior PDE-5i Strata: M/T FDC","deltaMin":0.56,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":34},"locations":{"siteCount":148,"countries":["United States","Australia","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Czechia","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Malaysia","Mexico","Poland","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38267108"],"seeAlso":["https://filehosting-v2.pharmacm.com/api/Attachment/Download?tenantId=80217051&amp;parentIdentifier=AC-077A301&amp;attachmentIdentifier=6a92fb9d-e152-4929-aa6b-06238109e9a5&amp;fileName=AC-077A301_-_RRF_KOM.pptx&amp;versionIdentifier="]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":35},"commonTop":["Headache","Oedema Peripheral","Diarrhoea","Cough","Peripheral Swelling"]}}
