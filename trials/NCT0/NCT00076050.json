The instrument has a structured format and the response choices consist of 4-point Likert scales ('yes definitely' to 'no, not at all'). Item scores are collapsed into a dichotomous scale, where higher scores indicate a greater level of symptomatology or difficulty; i.e., if the response is 1 or 2 (positive response), the score = 1; if the response is 3 or 4 (negative response), the score is 0. Results can be reported as a total score, where the range is 0-23, but also for each dimension. Thus, the ranges of the subscales are: for anxiety and mood 0-7, for well-being 0-4, somatic symptoms 0-5, memory and concentration 0-3, vasomotor symptoms 0-2 and sleep problems 0-2.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.73","spread":"0.54"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.34","spread":"0.77"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Vaginal Maturation Value","description":"The Vaginal Maturation Value (VMV) describes the proportion of the three vaginal epithelial cell types (parabasal, intermediate and superficial) obtained from a swab of the vaginal walls. The changes in the proportion of each type of cells reflects the degree of exposure to estrogen of the vaginal epithelium. The VMV lists the percentage of each type of cell appearing on the smear, with the total of all three values equaling 100%. The index is read from left to right; i.e. VMI of 5/40/55 represents 5% parabasal cells, 40% intermediate cells and 55% superficial cells. Exposure to estrogens results in some parabasal cells, a greater proportion of intermediate cells and few superficial cells.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.20","spread":"2.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.78","spread":"2.86"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":122},"commonTop":["abdominal bloating","headache","hair loss","dry mouth","constipation"]}}}
