Participants must have a confirmed diagnosis of PV within the previous 24 months (by skin or mucosal biopsy and immunohistochemistry) and evidence of active disease at screening.\n\nApproximately 135 participants will be enrolled at up to 60 centers worldwide. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rituximab plus MMF placebo or rituximab placebo plus MMF. Randomization will be stratified by duration of illness.\n\nThe study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to 28 days, a 52-week double-blind treatment period, and a 48-week safety follow up period that begins at the time of study treatment completion or discontinuation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants (Excluding Telemedicine [TM] Participants) Who Achieved Sustained Complete Remission, Evaluated by the Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) Activity Score","timeFrame":"From Baseline up to 52 Weeks (up to clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 28 November 2018)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab (RTX)","deltaMin":40.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)","deltaMin":9.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":68,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Israel","Italy","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34097368"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":67},"commonTop":["INFUSION RELATED REACTION","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","HEADACHE","NASOPHARYNGITIS","DIARRHOEA"]}}
