Examples include but are not limited to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic, haematological, immunological, and psychiatric disorders, and major physical impairment.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With IGA-CHE Treatment Success at Week 16","description":"The Investigator's Global Assessment for chronic hand eczema (IGA-CHE) is a 5 point scale used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's CHE from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).
