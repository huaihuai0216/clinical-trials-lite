Red blood cells contain iron that is needed to carry oxygen to the tissues. It is not yet known whether giving darbepoetin alfa (DA) together with intravenous iron or oral iron is more effective than giving darbepoetin alfa together with a placebo in treating anemia caused by chemotherapy.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving darbepoetin alfa together with iron to see how well it works compared with giving darbepoetin alfa together with a placebo in treating anemia caused by chemotherapy in patients with cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Hematopoietic Response Rate Defined as the Number of Participants Who Exhibit a Hematopoietic Response","timeFrame":"16 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DA + IV Iron","deltaMin":114,"sd":null},{"arm":"DA + Oral Iron","deltaMin":109,"sd":null},{"arm":"DA + Placebo","deltaMin":106,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.39"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.73"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":164},"commonTop":["Nausea","Constipation","Diarrhea-No Colostom","Pruritus","Vomiting"]}}
