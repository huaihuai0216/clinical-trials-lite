(non-emergency), open (non-laparoscopic), hepatic resection (anatomic or non-anatomic resections of at least one anatomical hepatic segment, or equivalent tissue volume).\n* A target bleeding site can be identified.\n* Target bleeding site is identified on the cut raw liver surface (resection area).\n* Target bleeding site has moderate bleeding according to the Investigator's judgment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Require hepatic resection due to trauma.\n* Infection in the anatomic surgical area.\n* History of severe (e.g. anaphylactic) reactions to blood or to any blood-derived product.\n* Previous known sensitivity to any Fibrin Sealant Grifols component or any Surgicel® component.\n* Females who are pregnant or nursing a child at Baseline (within 24 hours prior to surgical procedure).\n* Receiving an organ transplant during the same surgical procedure.\n* Undergone a therapeutic surgical procedure within 30 days from the screening visit.\n* A target bleeding site cannot be identified.\n* The target bleeding site has a mild or severe bleeding.\n* Occurrence of major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the planned surgical procedure.\n* Application of any topical haemostatic material on the resection surface of the liver prior to application of study treatment.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Proportion of
