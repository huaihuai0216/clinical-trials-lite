Chlamydial and gonococcal infections will be determined by vaginal swab testing at 4, 8, and 12 months after enrollment. Subjects will include 1500 women aged 15-25 years who have clinical evidence of BV, with no symptoms. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 possible study groups: the intervention group (treatment of BV) or the control group (no BV treatment). Every 2 months, subjects will complete a home self-testing kit for screening of BV using a swab. If BV is detected by self-test, the subjects in the interventional group will receive a 7 day course of the antibiotic metronidazole. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for up to 12 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"One-year Incidence of Chlamydial and Gonococcal Infections in Women Who Receive Screening (Every 2 Months) and Treatment for Asymptomatic Bacterial Vaginosis as Compared to a Control Group With Regular Monitoring (Every 2 Months) But no Treatment","timeFrame":"At 4, 8, and 12 months after enrollment.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":19.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":18.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.754"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26611782"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":682},"commonTop":[]}}
