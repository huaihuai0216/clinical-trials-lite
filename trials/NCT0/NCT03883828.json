The Skindex-16 is a validated 16-item self-administered survey instrument that measures the effects of skin disease on patients' quality of life. Scores were determined based on changes from baseline in the three scale subcategories: Symptoms (four items, range 0-24), Emotions (seven items, range 0-42), and Functioning (five items, range 0-30) where 0 = never bothered and 6 = always bothered. Net positive changes in respective subscale scoring were correlated with an improvement in that particular Quality of life assessment (i.e., Symptoms, Emotions, Functioning), while net negative changes in scoring corresponded to a decrease in that particular Quality of life assessment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":39},"commonTop":["Itch"]}}}
