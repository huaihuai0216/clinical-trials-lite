An exception is allowed for participants receiving a single dose of a short-acting (half-life ≤ 12 hours) antibacterial drug prior to randomization; up to 25% of participants may have received such therapy.\n* Infection due to an organism known prior to study entry to be resistant to dalbavancin or vancomycin (vancomycin MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) \\>8 μg/mL).\n* Evidence of meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis, gas gangrene, gangrene, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis; endovascular infection, such as clinical and/or echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or septic thrombophlebitis.\n* Infections caused exclusively by Gram-negative bacteria (without Gram-positive bacteria present) and infections caused by fungi, whether alone or in combination with a bacterial pathogen.\n* Venous catheter entry site infection.\n* Infections involving a diabetic foot ulceration, perirectal abscess or a decubitus ulcer.\n* Participant with an infected device, even if the device is removed. Examples include infection of: prosthetic cardiac valve, vascular graft, a pacemaker battery pack, joint prosthesis, hemodialysis catheter, implantable pacemaker or defibrillator, intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device, a peritoneal dialysis catheter, or a neurosurgical device such as a ventricular peritoneal shunt, intra-cranial pressure monitor, or epidural catheter.\n* Gram-negative bacteremia, even in the presence of Gram-positive infection or Gram-positive bacteremia. Note: If a Gram-negative bacteremia develops during the study, or is subsequently found to have been present at Baseline, the participant should be removed from study treatment and receive appropriate antibiotic(s) to treat the Gram-negative bacteremia. Such participants must have an end of treatment (EOT) visit performed within 3 calendar days after discontinuing study medication but are required to have AEs (adverse events) reported through the Final Visit.\n* Participants whose ABSSSI is the result of having sustained full or partial thickness burns.\n* Participants with an infection involving a limb with evidence of critical ischemia of an affected limb defined as any of the following criteria: absent or abnormal Doppler wave forms, toe blood pressure of \\<45 mm Hg, ankle brachial index \\<0.5, and/ or critical ischemia as assessed by a vascular surgeon.\n* Participants with ABSSSI such as superficial/simple cellulitis/erysipelas, impetiginous lesion, furuncle, or simple abscess that only requires surgical drainage for cure.\n* Concomitant condition requiring any antibiotic therapy that would interfere with the assessment of study drug for the condition under study.\n* Anticipated need of antibiotic therapy for longer than 14 days.\n* Participants who are placed in a hyperbaric chamber as adjunctive therapy for the ABSSSI.\n* More than 2 surgical interventions (defined as procedures conducted under sterile technique and typically unable to be performed at the bedside) for the ABSSSI, or participants who are expected to require more than 2 such interventions.\n* Medical conditions in which chronic inflammation may preclude assessment of clinical response to therapy even after successful treatment (e.g., chronic stasis dermatitis of the lower extremity).\n* Absolute neutrophil count \\<500 cells/mm\\^3.\n* Known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected participants with a CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) cell count \\<200 cells/mm3 or with a past or current acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining condition and unknown CD4 count.\n* Participants with a recent bone marrow transplant (in post-transplant hospital stay).\n* Participants receiving oral steroids \\>20 mg prednisolone per day (or equivalent) or receiving immunosuppressant drugs after organ transplantation.\n* Participants with a rapidly fatal illness, who are not expected to survive for 3 months.\n* Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the participants inappropriate for entry into this study.\n* Prior participation in this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Who Were Clinical Responders 48-72 Hours After the Initiation of Study Drug","description":"Clinical responder was defined as a participant who was alive and had received no rescue therapy for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) prior to the 48-72 hour infection site assessment (if an antibiotic has been given for another reason, the participant will not be considered a non-responder for this reason); and examination of the participant's ABSSSI lesion demonstrates a decrease of ≥ 20% in lesion area (calculated as the longest length multiplied by the longest perpendicular width) relative to the baseline measurement.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"81.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"84.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants by Clinical Status at End of Treatment (EOT) and Final Visit (FV)","description":"Clinical Success is defined as follows: For evaluation at EOT visit, lesion area must be decreased by ≥80% from baseline and at FV lesion area must be decreased by ≥90% from baseline; Temperature is ≤37.6°C; Local signs of tenderness to palpation and swelling/induration are no worse than mild; For evaluation at EOT visit, local signs of fluctuance and localized heat/warmth must be improved from baseline and no worse than mild, and at FV local signs of fluctuance and localized heat/warmth must be absent; for participants with a wound infection the severity of purulent drainage is improved and no worse than mild relative to baseline.
