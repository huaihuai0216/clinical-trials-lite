This includes chronic administration of corticosteroids, long-acting immune-modifying agents or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy\n* Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine. However, licensed pneumococcal vaccines and non-replicating vaccines may be administered up until 8 days prior to dose 1 and/or dose 2 and/or at least 14 days after any dose of study vaccine.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product\n* Previous vaccination against VZV or HZ.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting 3 months before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions in the period up to 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Incidence Rate of Confirmed Herpes Zoster (HZ) Cases","description":"A suspected case of HZ is defined as a new unilateral rash accompanied by pain (broadly defined to include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations) and no alternative diagnosis.
