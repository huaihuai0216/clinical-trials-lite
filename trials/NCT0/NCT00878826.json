Formation of blood clots, or venous thromboemboli (VTE) in pregnancy can have dangerous and even life-threatening effects on the mother and fetus. Enoxaparin is the preferred medicine to prevent clotting in pregnant patients who are at risk for VTE, because it has been studied to be safe and effective in pregnancy without any harms to the fetus. Although this medication is routinely used and is recommended by several prominent medical groups, the optimal dosing for prevention of VTE is still unclear. The range of standardly prescribed dosing regimens of Enoxaparin includes 40mg daily and 1mg/kg daily, but these two dosing strategies have never been compared in a head to head fashion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Peak Anti-Xa Level","timeFrame":"One measurement per trimester of pregnancy, up to 36 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Enoxaparin 40 mg Per Day","deltaMin":0.35,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Enoxaparin 1 mg Per kg Daily","deltaMin":0.46,"sd":0.27},{"arm":"Enoxaparin 60 mg Per Day","deltaMin":0.57,"sd":0.01}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.4"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.9"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.3"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33779986"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":3},"commonTop":[]}}
