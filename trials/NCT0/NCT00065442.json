This state of the disease is androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC).\n* Cancer that has spread outside the prostate (metastatic) to lymph nodes or bone. Please note that if your cancer has spread to organs (e.g., liver, lung, brain), you are not eligible for the study.\n* The absence of or minimal current cancer-related pain\n\nPlease note that there are additional eligibility criteria. The study center will determine if you meet all of the criteria.\n\nStudy personnel will explain the trial in detail and answer any questions you may have if you do qualify for the study. You can then decide whether or not you wish to participate. If you do not qualify for the trial, study personnel will explain the reasons.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Survival","description":"Time from randomization until death due to any cause.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Objective Disease Progression","description":"Measured by imaging studies; confirmed by independent imaging review","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.6","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":40,"n":168},"commonTop":["Chills","Fatigue","Back pain","Nausea","Pyrexia"]}}}
