Enrolment of a female patient of childbearing potential is allowed only if she is tested negative in the pregnancy testing at the start of Treatment Period 1 and if she agrees to undergo pregnancy testing at the protocol-specified timings and to take contraceptive measures without fail.\n* Written informed consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable representative of the subject. Consent of the subject him/herself should also be obtained, wherever possible, after giving an explanation in an as easy to understand as possible manner.\n* An outpatient who has been treated with ICS (FP 100μg/day or equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n* Able to use a peak flow meter in a correct manner in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.\n* Able to use MDI and DPI in a correct manner (with the assistance of his/her caregiver as necessary) in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.\n\nInclusion Criteria for Entry in Treatment Period 1 A subject will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups only if he/she has completed the run-in period and meets all the following criteria.\n\n1. Has a mean of morning PEF measurements in the last 7 days of the run-in period (excluding the first day of Treatment Period 1) ≤90% of his/her best PEF measurement .\n2. Was able to perform entry in the asthma diary and PEF measurements in a correct manner in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.\n3. Able to use MDI and DPI in a correct manner (with the assistance of his/her caregiver as necessary) in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Exclusion Criteria for Entry in Run-in Period\n\nA patient who applies any of the following criteria is not eligible for the study:\n\n* Admitted to the hospital due to asthma exacerbation within 8 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n* Used systemic steroid within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n* Received antibacterials or antivirals for treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infection within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n* Has a safety problem in participation in the study because of a serious, uncontrolled systemic disease including nervous system disorder.\n* Has or is suspected to have deep-seated mycosis or infection to which no effective antibacterial agent is available.\n* Has or is suspected to have hypersensitivity to the investigational product, rescue medication or any ingredients of them.\n* Is pregnant or lactating, may be pregnant, or plans for pregnancy during the study period.\n* Has received the last dose in another clinical study within 2 months prior to this study.\n* Is not eligible for the study in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Entry in Treatment Period 1\n\nEnrolment of a subject completing the run-in period into Treatment Period 1 will not be allowed if any of the following applies:\n\n1. Admitted to the hospital due to asthma exacerbation during the run-in period.\n2. Had upper or lower respiratory tract infection during the 2 weeks just before Visit 2.\n3. Used prohibited drugs during the 2 weeks just before Visit 2.\n4. Is not eligible for the study in the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.\n\nExclusion Criteria for Entry in Treatment Period 2\n\nEnrolment of a subject completing the washout period into Treatment Period 2 will not be allowed if any of the following applies:\n\n1. Admitted to the hospital due to asthma exacerbation during the washout period.\n2. Had upper or lower respiratory tract infection during the 2 weeks just before Visit 4.\n3.
