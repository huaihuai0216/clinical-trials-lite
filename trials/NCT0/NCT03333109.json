The HIT-6 was developed as a global measure of adverse headache impact to assess headache severity in the previous month and change in a patient's clinical status over a short period of time. Six items assess the frequency of pain severity, headaches limiting daily activity (household, work, school, and social). Each of the 6 questions is responded to using 1 of 5 response categories: \"never,\" \"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" \"very often,\" or \"always.\" For each HIT-6 item, 6, 8, 10, 11, or 13 points, respectively, are assigned to the response provided. These points were summed to produce a total HIT-6 score that ranges from 36 to 78. Scores were categorized into 4 grades, representing little or no impact (49 or less), some impact (50-55), substantial impact (56-59), and severe impact (60-78) due to headache.
