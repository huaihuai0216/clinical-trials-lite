Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is needed.\n\nIndividual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not covered by another Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) certified clinical center during the 3 years of the study.\n\nIndividual has any of the following ocular characteristics:\n\n* History of prior panretinal photocoagulation (prior PRP is defined as â‰¥ 100 burns outside of the posterior pole)\n* Tractional retinal detachment involving the macula.\n\n  \\-- A tractional retinal detachment is not an exclusion if it is outside of the posterior pole (not threatening the macula) and in the investigator's judgment, is not a contraindication to intravitreal ranibizumab treatment and also does not preclude deferring PRP for at least 4 weeks in the setting of intravitreal ranibizumab\n* Exam evidence of neovascularization of the angle (neovascularization of the iris alone is not an exclusion if it does not preclude deferring PRP for at least 4 weeks in the investigator's judgment).\n* If macular edema is present, it is considered to be primarily due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.\n\n  \\-- An eye should not be considered eligible if:\n  * macular edema is present that is considered to be related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or\n  * clinical exam and/or OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities disease (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) is the primary cause of any macular edema.\n* An ocular condition is present (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., retinal vein or artery occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc.).\n\n  \\-- A vitreous or preretinal hemorrhage is not an exclusion if it is out of the visual axis and in the investigator's judgment is not having any affect on visual acuity.\n* Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye were otherwise normal).\n* History of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment at any time in the past 2 months.\n* History of corticosteroid treatment (intravitreal or peribulbar) at any time in the past 4 months.\n\n  --If the investigator believes that there may still be a substantial effect 4 months after prior treatment (e.g., dose of intravitreal triamcinolone higher than 4 mg), the eye should not be included.\n* History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or anticipated within the next 6 months following randomization.\n* History of (yttrium-aluminum-garnet) YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.\n* Aphakia.\n* Uncontrolled glaucoma (in investigator's judgment).\n* Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or substantial blepharitis","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Change in Visual Acuity From Baseline","description":"Visual acuity is measured as a continuous integer letter score from 0 to 100, with higher numbers indicating better visual acuity.
