Subject is between 18-55 years of age, inclusive.\n2. Subject meets the following criteria for a diagnosis of BED:\n\n   * Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following: eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, within a 2-hour period) an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar conditions, and a sense of lack of control over the eating (eg, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).\n   * The binge eating episodes are associated with at least 3 of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of being embarrassed by how much one is eating; feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or feeling very guilty after overeating.\n   * Marked distress regarding binge eating.\n   * The binge eating occurs, on average, at least 2 days a week for 6 months.\n   * The episodes of binge eating do not occur exclusively during the course of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.\n3. Subject is consistently able to swallow a capsule.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject has current diagnosis of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa.\n2. Subject is receiving psychotherapy or weight loss support within the past 3 months.\n3. Subject has used psychostimulants to facilitate fasting or dieting within the past 6 months.\n4. Subject has known history of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, advanced arteriosclerosis, structural cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease.\n5. Subject has abnormal thyroid function.\n6. Subject initiated treatment with a lipid lowering medication within the past 3 months.\n7. Subject has a history of moderate or severe hypertension.\n8. Subject has a recent history (within the past 6 months) of suspected substance abuse or dependence disorder.\n9. Subject has glaucoma.\n10. Subject is female and pregnant or nursing.\n11.
