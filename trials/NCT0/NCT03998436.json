Unresponsive to ulcer care and open for at least 6 weeks at the time of the Screening Visit;\n   7. Ulcer is non-infected as determined by clinical assessment and complete hemogram;\n   8. Ulcer has a clean, granulating base free of adherent slough to the greatest extent possible as per Investigator;\n   9. Ulcer area reduction \\< 30% from the Screening Visit to Baseline visit\n6. Clinically normal resting 12-lead ECG at Screening Visit or, if abnormal, considered not clinically significant by the Investigator\n7. Subject, if female of child-bearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and willing to use acceptable methods of contraception (birth control pills, barriers) or abstinence throughout the Study\n8. Subject is able and willing to comply with Study procedures including the use of an off-loading device (as applicable for the location of the ulcer) and adhere to protocol during the Study in the opinion of Investigator\n9.

Actively infected ulcers with or without purulent discharge, ulcers with exposed bone or associated with osteomyelitis\n2. Subjects with more than three ulcers below knee\n3. Subjects with Target Ulcer requiring off-loading that cannot be effectively off-loaded; or unable to tolerate the off-loading method\n4. Subject has ulcers caused by a disease other than diabetes, e.g., fungal ulcerations, malignant ulcerations, and ulcerations due to venous or arterial insufficiency, or due to hematological disorders, in the opinion of the Investigator\n5. Ulcer, about which the Investigator is suspicious for cancer\n6. Subjects with a gangrenous or ischemic ulcer\n7. Subject with ulcer that in the opinion of the Investigator, may need amputation\n8.
