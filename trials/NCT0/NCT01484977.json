Additionally, subjects must experience at least 1 seizure during the 4-week Prospective Seizure Baseline\n* Subject has been maintained on a stable dose of LEV and a sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drug (SCB-AED) for at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and during the 4-week Prospective Seizure Baseline\n* The minimum required seizure frequency during the 8-week Retrospective Seizure Baseline is on average ≥ 2 partial-onset seizures per 28 days (based on investigator assessment of subject report) with at least 1 seizure per 4 week period within the 8-week Retrospective Seizure Baseline\n* Subject has been maintained on a stable dose of levetiracetam (LEV) and a sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drug (SCB-AED) for at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and during the 4-week Prospective Seizure Baseline, with or without additional concurrent stable vagal nerve stimulation (VNS).
