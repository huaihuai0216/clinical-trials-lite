It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 component sets: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Each domain has at least 2 component questions. There are 4 possible responses for each component 0=without any difficulty 1=with some difficulty 2=with much difficulty 3=unable to do. To calculate HAQ-DI the participant must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains. The HAQ-DI is the sum of the scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score (in range 6-8) for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.75","spread":"0.53"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.23","spread":"0.31"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score at Baseline and Week 24","description":"FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire.

For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participants response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).
