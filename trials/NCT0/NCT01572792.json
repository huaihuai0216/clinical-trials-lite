Long-term efficacy, pharmacoeconomic and health-related quality of life assessments will also be evaluated. This extension study will include a 28 week treatment period, followed by a four week follow up visit. All patients will remain in the same treatment group as for the lead-in study and continue on one of the four treatment arms or placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients to Experience Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event","timeFrame":"Baseline of lead-in study to follow-up call 14±3 days after last dose of investigational product (up to Week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":56.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Aclidinium/Formmoterol 400/12 μg","deltaMin":65.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Aclidinium/Formoterol 400/6 μg","deltaMin":61.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Aclidinium 400 μg","deltaMin":67.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Formoterol 12 μg","deltaMin":64.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":208,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28340861"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=4062&filename=lac-md-36-synopsis.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":146},"commonTop":["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Nasopharyngitis","Urinary tract infection","Upper respiratory tract infection","Cough"]}}
