should be enrolled in the study.\n* A male or female aged 18 years or above at the time of the vaccination.\n* Written informed consent obtained from the subject.\n* Healthy subjects or with well-controlled chronic diseases as established by medical history and clinical examination before entering into the study.\n* If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the vaccination or planned use during the study period.\n* Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study.\n* Administration of an influenza vaccine within 6 months preceding the study start.\n* Administration of an influenza vaccine other than the study vaccine during the entire study\n* Clinically or virologically confirmed influenza infection within 6 months preceding the study start\n* History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.\n* Not stabilized or clinically serious chronic underlying disease.\n* Lactating female.\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
