For the CLD/CHD cohort:\n\n   1.

Subjects with CHD - infants in their first year of life and documented, hemodynamically significant CHD (must be unoperated or partially corrected CHD) Note: Infants with hemodynamically significant acyanotic cardiac lesions must have pulmonary hypertension (≥ 40 mmHg measured pressure in the pulmonary artery) or the need for daily medication to manage CHD\n3. Infants who are entering their first RSV season at the time of screening\n4. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the USA, EU Data Privacy Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject's parent(s)/legal representative(s) prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations\n5. Subject's parent(s)/legal representative(s) able to understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol including follow-up and illness visits as judged by the investigator\n6. Subject is available to complete the follow-up period, which will be 1 year after Season 1/ Dose 1 for subjects without CLD/CHD, or 1 year after Season 2/Dose 1 (or last replacement dose as applicable for CHD) for subjects with CLD/CHD\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n1. Any fever (≥ 100.4°F \\[≥ 38.0°C\\], regardless of route) or acute illness within 7 days prior to randomization\n2. Any history of LRTI or active LRTI prior to, or at the time of, randomization\n3. Known history of RSV infection or active RSV infection prior to, or at the time of, randomization\n4. Hospitalization at the time of randomization, unless discharge is expected within the 7 days after randomization\n5. Requirement for mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, CPAP, or other mechanical respiratory or cardiac support at the time of randomization\n6. Anticipated cardiac surgery within 2 weeks after randomization\n7. Anticipated survival of \\< 6 months after randomization\n8. Receipt of any investigational drug\n9. Known renal impairment\n10. Known hepatic dysfunction including known or suspected active or chronic hepatitis infection\n11. Clinically significant congenital anomaly of the respiratory tract\n12. Chronic seizure, or evolving or unstable neurologic disorder\n13. Prior history of a suspected or actual acute life-threatening event\n14. Known immunodeficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n15. Mother with HIV infection (unless the child has been proven to be not infected)\n16. Any known allergy, including to immunoglobulin products, or history of allergic reaction\n17. Receipt of palivizumab or other RSV mAb or any RSV vaccine, including maternal RSV vaccination\n18. Receipt of any monoclonal or polyclonal antibody (for example, hepatitis B immune globulin, intravenous immunoglobulin) or anticipated use during the study\n19. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with evaluation of the study drug or interpretation of subject safety or study results\n20.
