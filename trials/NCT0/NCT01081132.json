Subject meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for a primary diagnosis of ADHD, combined subtype, or hyperactive/impulsive subtype, based on a detailed psychiatric evaluation using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia - Present and Lifetime version (K SADS PL) at screening (re-confirm if baseline visit is \\>35 days from screening).\n4.
