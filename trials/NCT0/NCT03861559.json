The participants were asked to rate their relief on the following scale: 1=complete, 2=marked, 3=moderate, 4=slight, and 5=none. If a participant recorded a degree of relief that was at least moderate (3 or below), they answered the question, \"When did you first experience noticeable relief?\" and noted the date and time. The data were analyzed using a log ranked test and with a Kaplan-Meier estimate. Any participant who did not experience at least moderate relief by the end of 72 hours was considered censored at that time in the analysis. Time to onset of relief is presented in hours.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"72.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline (CFB) in the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged Over 15 Days of Treatment, as Assessed by Participant","description":"CFB, averaged over study days 1-15, was calculated for TNSS assessed by participants.
