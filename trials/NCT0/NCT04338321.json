The C-SSRS is an assessment tool that evaluates suicidal ideation and behavior. Suicidal ideation consists of 5 items: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intention to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, and active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent. Suicidal behavior consists of 5 items: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt (non-fatal), and completed suicide. The maximum score (from the 10 categories) assigned for each participant was summarized into one of three broad categories: No suicidal ideation or behavior (0), Suicidal ideation (1 - 5), Suicidal behavior (6 - 10). Total score ranges from 1 to 10. Higher scores indicate more severe suicidal ideation and behavior.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":334},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Somnolence","Headache","Nausea","Dissociation"]}}}
