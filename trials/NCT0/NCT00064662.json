The secondary aims of the trial are to compare other outcomes for the two surgical procedures, including quality of life, sexual function, satisfaction with treatment outcomes, complications, and need for other treatment(s)after surgery. Follow-up will be a minimum of two years and up to four years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"24 Month Cumulative Success Rate Computed From Kaplan Meier Time-to-event Analysis (Reported as Percent Success).","timeFrame":"Two years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Burch","deltaMin":38,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sling","deltaMin":47,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["17437826","17517855","19286143","19274758","20976815","19296969","17684087","19837421","21153471","17618773","18804239","17304525","18313452","18060972","17315221","17270617","18295276","16325621","18206917","18757661","21128068","19030190","18378749","16360445","17036169","18682875","16813912","16697832","17601894","21996108","21996105","21789658","21560157","25800900","22704099","22341290","20093904","19625327","19183825"],"seeAlso":["http://www.uitn.net"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":32,"n":329},"commonTop":["Genitourinary","Wound complication not requiring surgical intervention","Pulmonary","Gastrointestinal","Vascular/ Hematologic"]}}
