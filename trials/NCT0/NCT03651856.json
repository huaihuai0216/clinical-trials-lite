Atomoxetine (ATM) is an approved drug currently on the market for the treatment of attention deficit. It works to increase the amount of norepinephrine (a chemical in the brain that helps keep us awake and alert) in our brain. ATM has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be used in the treatment of PD, but has been found to be well tolerated in this patient population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events","timeFrame":"week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Atomoxetine","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Increase in Creatine","Worsening Fog (Freezing of Gait)","Diarrhea","Worsening Dyskinesia","Nausea"]}}
