Highly effective methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs (hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.\n\nSubjects who are receiving WHO step II or Step III analgesic medication who have constipation induced, or worsened by their opioid medication, as shown by\n\n1. the subject's medical need of regular intake of laxatives to have at least 3 bowel evacuations per week, or having less than 3 bowel evacuations when not taking a laxative, respectively.\n2. the subject's self-assessment that their constipation was induced or worsened by their current pre-study opioid medication.\n\nDocumented history of moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain that requires around the-clock opioid therapy (starting dose of oxycodone PR between 20-80 mg/day) \\& are likely to benefit from WHO step III opioid therapy for the duration of the study.

However, all concomitant medications that are considered necessary for the subject's welfare should be continued at a stable dose throughout the double-blind phase of the study \\& under the supervision of the investigator.\n\nExpected survival time \\> 3 months.\n\nWith capability of reading, understanding \\& signing inform consent form \\& compliance with protocol requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria Subjects that require a dose \\>80 mg/day oxycodone PR at the start of the double-blind phase.\n\nAny history of hypersensitivity to oxycodone, naloxone, morphine, bisacodyl, related products \\& other ingredients.\n\nSubjects with any situation in which opioids are contra-indicated, severe respiratory depression with hypoxia \\& or hypercapnia, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonal, severe bronchial asthma, paralytic ileus.\n\nSubjects with evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal disease (e.g. paralytic ileus, peritoneal carcinosis), significant structural abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. scarring, obstruction etc) either related or not related to the underlying cancer or disease progression.\n\nEvidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic or psychiatric disease, as determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests, ECG results \\& physical examination, that would place the subject at risk upon exposure to the study medication or that may confound the analysis \\& or interpretation of the study results.\n\nAbnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST; SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; SGPT), r-glutamyltransferase (GGT) or alkaline phosphatase levels (\\>3 times the upper limit of normal) or an abnormal total bilirubin \\& or creatinine level(s) (greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal).\n\nCyclic chemotherapy in the two weeks before the screening visit or planned during the core study that has shown in the past to influence bowel function. If subjects are having their first cycle of chemotherapy during the 2 weeks before the screening visit or during the double-blind phase of the study they should be excluded from the study.\n\nRadiotherapy that, in the investigators opinion, would influence bowel function or pain during the double-blind phase of the study.\n\nSubjects with known or suspected unstable brain metastases or spinal cord compression that may require changes in steroid treatment throughout the duration of the study.\n\nSubjects with uncontrolled seizures.\n\nSubjects with increased intracranial pressure.\n\nIn the investigator's opinion, subjects who are receiving hypnotics or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants that may pose a risk of additional CNS depression with opioid study medication.\n\nSubjects with myxoedema, not adequately treated hypothyroidism or Addisons disease.\n\nSubjects who have a confirmed diagnosis of ongoing irritable bowel syndrome(IBS).\n\nSurgery completed within 4 weeks prior to the start of the Screening Period, or planned surgery during the study that would influence pain or bowel function during the study or preclude completion of the study.\n\nSubjects receiving opioid substitution therapy for opioid addiction (e.g. methadone or buprenorphine).\n\nActive alcohol or drug abuse \\& or history of opioid abuse.\n\nSubjects suffering from diarrhoea \\& or opioid withdrawal.\n\nSubjects presently taking, or who have taken, naloxone â‰¤30 days prior to the start of the Screening Period.\n\nSubjects who participated in a clinical research study involving a new chemical entity or an experimental drug within 30 days of study entry (defined as the start of the Screening Period), unless the subject is on data collection phase for Overall Survival.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"The Change of BFI-Bowel Function Index at visit8","description":"BFI is the mean of NAS for the following items:\n\n* Ease of defecation\n* Feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation.\n* Personal judgment of constipation.
