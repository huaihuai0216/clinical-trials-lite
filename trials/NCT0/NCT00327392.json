This is called procedural sedation. With respect to minimal-to-moderate procedural sedation for minor surgical procedures, a patient is first given a pain-relief medication (analgesic) and then a medication to help him/her relax and keep calm (sedative). AQUAVAN is a chemically modified form of propofol, a commonly-used sedative drug. AQUAVAN acts like a slow release version of propofol, and is being studied to see if it can safely keep patients calm and relaxed during their medical procedure and then allow for rapid and clear-headed recovery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence of Airway Assistance in Patients Undergoing Minor Surgical Procedures","timeFrame":"2 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fospropofol Disodium","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":15,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":123},"commonTop":["Paresthesia","Procedural pain","Pruritus","Nausea","Vomiting"]}}
