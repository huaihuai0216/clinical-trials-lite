Emapalumab can be administered as the first-line therapy to patients not previously treated with the current standard of care, or can be given to patients who have either failed or were unable to tolerate the available standard of care.\n\nEmapalumab is to be administered until the start of conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with an anticipated duration ranging from a minimum of 4 weeks to approximately 12 weeks and not exceeding 6 months.\n\nAfter treatment completion, patients will continue in the study for long-term follow-up until 1 year after either HSCT or last emapalumab infusion (if HSCT is not performed).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Response at Week 8 or End of Treatment (if Earlier)","timeFrame":"Up to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"All-treated Analysis Set","deltaMin":62.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"All-treated Analysis Set - Treatment naïve","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"All-treated Analysis Set - Treatment Experienced","deltaMin":73.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.0053"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"0.2839"},{"comp":"OG002","p":"0.0031"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":27,"countries":["United States","Canada","Germany","Italy","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":16},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Diarrhoea","Pyrexia","Hypertension","Pain"]}}
