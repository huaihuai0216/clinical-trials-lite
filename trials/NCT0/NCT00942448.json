Other GI disturbances or disease that in the opinion of the investigator could be negatively affected by the administration of NSAIDs.\n* Clinical signs or history of coagulation disorders that could be negatively affected by NSAIDs administration.\n* Hepatic or renal impairment.\n* Patients with significant cardiac impairment, history of cerebrovascular disease, history or peripheral arterial disease, uncontrolled hypertension.\n* Hypersensitivity to diclofenac or other NSAIDs or to one of the study medication components.\n* Patients under chronic treatment with topical or systemic analgesics/NSAIDs.\n* Patients under treatment with any medication that may affect the treatment efficacy evaluation.\n* Patients under treatment with any medication whose concomitant use may be susceptible to interactions with diclofenac or may affect safety.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65
