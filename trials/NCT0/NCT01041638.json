Monoclonal antibodies, such as Ch14.18, may find tumor cells and help kill them. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Isotretinoin may help neuroblastoma cells become more like normal cells, and to grow and spread more slowly. Giving monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 with sargramostim, aldesleukin, and isotretinoin after autologous stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for neuroblastoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Experienced a Significant (CTC Grade 3-5) Nonhematologic Toxicity of Interest (Pain, Hypotension, Allergic Reactions, Capillary Leak Syndrome, or Fever).","timeFrame":"Up to 6 courses of therapy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Chimeric Antibody 14.18 With GM-CSF, IL-2 and Isotretinoin","deltaMin":17.3077,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":17,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":103,"n":104},"commonTop":["33900-Fever","42600-Hypoalbuminemia","13200-Anemia","65800-Platelet count decreased","42700-Hypocalcemia"]}}
