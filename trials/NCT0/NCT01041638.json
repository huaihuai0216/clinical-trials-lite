patients who meet those criteria must also meet the protocol specified criteria for bone marrow response as outlined below: =\\< 10% tumor (of total nucleated cellular content) seen on any specimen from a bilateral bone marrow aspirate/biopsy; patients who have no tumor seen on the prior bone marrow, and then have =\\< 10% tumor on any of the bilateral marrow aspirate/biopsy specimens done at pre-ASCT and/or pre-enrollment evaluation will also be eligible; (Note that, per INRC, this would have been defined as an \"overall\" response of progressive disease \\[PD\\])\n* Prior to enrollment on ANBL0931, a determination of residual disease must be performed (tumor imaging studies including metaiodobenzylguanidine \\[MIBG\\] scan, computed tomography \\[CT\\] or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\], bone marrow aspiration and biopsy); this disease assessment is required for eligibility, and should be done preferably within 2 weeks but must be done within a maximum of 4 weeks before enrollment\n\n  * Patients with residual disease are eligible; biopsy is not required\n  * Patients must not have progressive disease except for protocol specified bone marrow response\n* All patients must have completed therapy including intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCT and radiotherapy to be eligible; radiotherapy may be waived for patients who either had a small adrenal mass which was completely resected upfront, or who never had an identifiable primary tumor\n* No more than 9 months from the date of starting the first induction chemotherapy after diagnosis to the date of ASCT except for the rare occasions as noted below; for tandem ASCT patients, this will be the date of the FIRST stem cell infusion; Exception: for those who are initially diagnosed as non-high risk neuroblastoma, but later converted (and/ or relapsed) to high risk neuroblastoma, the 9 months restriction should start from the date of induction therapy for high risk neuroblastoma (not from the initial induction therapy for non-high risk disease), to the date of ASCT\n* Use Karnofsky for patients \\> 16 years of age and Lansky for patients =\\< 16 years of age; required patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance scale score of \\>= 50%\n* Patients must have a life expectancy of \\>= 2 months (8 weeks)\n* Total absolute phagocyte count (APC = neutrophils + monocytes) is at least 1000/uL\n* Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\>= 70 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:\n\n  * 1 month to \\< 6 months: 0.4 mg/dL\n  * 6 months to \\< 1 year: 0.5 mg/dL\n  * 1 to \\< 2 years: 0.6 mg/dL\n  * 2 to \\< 6 years: 0.8 mg/dL\n  * 6 to \\< 10 years: 1 mg/dL\n  * 10 to \\< 13 years: 1.2 mg/dL\n  * 13 to \\< 16 years: 1.5 mg/dL (male), 1.4 mg/dL (female)\n  * \\>= 16 years: 1.7 mg/dL (male), 1.4 mg/dL (female)\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\]) \\< 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age\n* SOS (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, formerly known as veno-occlusive disease \\[VOD\\]), if present, should be stable or improving\n* Shortening fraction of \\>= 27% by echocardiogram, or ejection fraction of \\>= 55% by radionuclide angiography\n* No evidence of dyspnea at rest\n* If pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are performed, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) \\> 60% by pulmonary function test\n* Patients with seizure disorder may be enrolled if on anticonvulsants and well controlled\n* Central nervous system (CNS) toxicity \\< grade 2\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test\n* Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective birth control method\n* Female patients who are lactating must agree to stop breast-feeding\n* Patients must not have received prior anti-GD2 antibody therapy\n* Patients must not have received prior vaccine therapy administered as treatment of neuroblastoma not routine infectious disease vaccinations","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Patients Who Experienced a Significant (CTC Grade 3-5) Nonhematologic Toxicity of Interest (Pain, Hypotension, Allergic Reactions, Capillary Leak Syndrome, or Fever).","description":"Designed to collect comprehensive safety/toxicity data, as well as additional efficacy data for the immunotherapy.
