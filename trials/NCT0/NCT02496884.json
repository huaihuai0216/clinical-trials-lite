Because it is excreted through the kidneys, people who have reduced kidney function will not process the drug as well as with those with normal kidney function, so the dose must be reduced. This study will test two reduced dose levels for both moderately reduced and severely reduced kidney function. The study will test the hypothesis that the drug will be safe and well-tolerated in people who have both fibromyalgia and chronic kidney disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Experiencing a Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)","timeFrame":"Baseline up to 30 days after last dose, up to 25 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"M-CKD Placebo","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"M-CKD DS-5565 7.5 mg BID","deltaMin":16,"sd":null},{"arm":"S-CKD Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"S-CKD DS-5565 7.5 mg QD","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Czechia","Hungary","Poland","Romania","South Africa","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Dizziness","Headache","Hyperuricaemia","Drug withdrawal syndrome"]}}
