Four constructs were measured. Severity of Suicidal ideation is rated on a 5-point ordinal scale. Intensity of ideation is comprised of 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason for ideation), each rated on a 5-point ordinal scale. Suicidal behavior is rated on a nominal scale that includes actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior. Lethality, assesses actual attempts; actual lethality is rated on a 6-point ordinal scale, and if actual lethality is 0, potential lethality of attempts is rated on a 3-point ordinal scale.The higher the C-SSRS score, the higher the suicide risk (ie. worse outcome).","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Weekly Average of Individual Daily Pain Scores (ADPS)","description":"Each day participants will rate their worst pain over the last 24 hours on a scale from 0-10, where 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable.
