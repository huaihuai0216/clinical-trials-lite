Subjects were required to fast for 8 hours prior to the study. Patients were given a primed insulin infusion of 2 mU/kg/min. Serum glucose measurements were made at five-minute intervals from an arterialized venous sample achieved by placing the hand in a warming box at 50Â°C. Blood glucose levels are checked every 5 minutes and 20% dextrose infusion is adjusted to maintain a serum glucose level of approximately 80 mg/dL. Subjects were considered to have achieved steady state when the dextrose infusion rate required to maintain a serum glucose level of 80 mg/dL varied by no greater than 5%. To compute the steady-state glucose disposal rate, we averaged the glucose infusion rates over the last 20 minutes of the clamp and applied a \"space correction\" to account for small changes in serum glucose levels over that time period.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Inter-Quartile Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3.4","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":[]}}}
