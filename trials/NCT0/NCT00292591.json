Mothers will be randomized to one of three vitamin D dosing groups: 400, 2,000 or 4,000 international units per day. It is hypothesized that the highest dosing regimen will result in a better vitamin D status of women regardless of their ethnicity or race.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration","timeFrame":"7 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cholecalciferol-400 IU","deltaMin":32.5,"sd":14.4},{"arm":"Cholecalciferol 2000 IU","deltaMin":41,"sd":14.6},{"arm":"Cholecalciferol 4000 IU","deltaMin":45.7,"sd":14.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15671234","15689596","21706518","21857221","39077939","29046301"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":166},"commonTop":["Complications of Pregnancy"]}}
