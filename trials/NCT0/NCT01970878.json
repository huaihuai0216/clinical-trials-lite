This study is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Glycopyrrolate (GP) and Formoterol Fumarate (FF) combination (GFF) metered dose inhaler (MDI), GP MDI, and FF MDI in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD over a total observation period of 52 weeks. Open-label Spiriva is included as an active control. To be eligible for this study, a subject must complete participation in Study PT003006 (NCT01854645) or Study PT003007 (NCT01854658).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Morning -Pre-dose Trough FEV1 Over 52 Weeks","timeFrame":"Baseline and Weeks 2 to 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GFF MDI (PT003)","deltaMin":0.133,"sd":null},{"arm":"GP MDI (PT001)","deltaMin":0.076,"sd":null},{"arm":"FF MDI (PT005)","deltaMin":0.068,"sd":null},{"arm":"Spiriva® Handihaler® (Open-label)","deltaMin":0.107,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":125,"countries":["United States","Australia","New Zealand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35815359"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":114,"n":1036},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper Respiratory Tract Infection"]}}
