The study will enroll patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), who are either currently receiving or expected to require hemodialysis through a prosthetic vascular graft within 30 days. Gore proposes to demonstrate that the 6 month cumulative patency of the GORE® ACUSEAL Vascular Graft is similar to that of other arteriovenous grafts (AVGs). \\> \\>\\>\n\n\\>\n\n\\>\\> A total of 138 Subjects will be enrolled.
