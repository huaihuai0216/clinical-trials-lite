The study will also compare lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab with the standard of care treatment of regorafenib and TAS-102 (trifluridine and tipiracil hydrochloride).\n\nThe primary study hypothesis is that lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab is superior to standard of care with respect to overall survival.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 22 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenvatinib+Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":9.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care (SOC) Treatment","deltaMin":9.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0379"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":33},"locations":{"siteCount":95,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","China","Denmark","Germany","Israel","Japan","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38833658"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":106,"n":238},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Diarrhoea","Proteinuria","Nausea","Decreased appetite"]}}
