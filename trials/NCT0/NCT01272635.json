NOTE: children who have evidence of well-controlled symptoms immediately preceding study entry while receiving Step 2 controller therapy (presence of self-reported symptoms on average no more than 2 times per week and less than 2 nights per month of nocturnal awakenings, requiring albuterol, during the 4 weeks preceding visit 1) may be enrolled and will have their controller therapy discontinued upon study entry.\n* Use of OCS in the past 2 weeks.\n* Daily symptoms or \\>2 nocturnal awakenings, requiring albuterol, on average in the last 2 weeks.\n* Use of antibiotics in the past month.\n* Current treatment with antibiotics for diagnosed sinus disease.\n* Participation presently or in the past month in another investigational drug trial.\n* Evidence that the family may be unreliable or nonadherent, or may move from the clinical center area before trial completion.\n* Contraindication of use of systemic corticosteroids or azithromycin.\n* Clinically relevant gastroesophageal reflux.\n* Concurrent medical conditions other than asthma that are likely to require oral or injectable corticosteroids during the study.\n* If receiving allergy shots, change in dose within the past 3 months.\n\nParticipants who meet any of the following criteria are NOT eligible for enrollment, and may not be re-enrolled:\n\n* Gestation less than late preterm as defined as birth before 34 weeks gestational age.\n* Presence of lung disease other than asthma, such as cystic fibrosis and BPD. Evaluation during the screening process will assure that an adequate evaluation of other lung diseases has been performed.\n* Presence of other significant medical illnesses (cardiac, liver, gastrointestinal, endocrine) that would place the study subject at increased risk of participating in the study.\n* Immunodeficiency disorders.\n* History of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.\n* History of hypoxic seizure.\n* History of significant adverse reaction to any study medication ingredient.\n* The child has significant developmental delay/failure to thrive, defined as crossing of two major percentile lines during the last year for age and gender. If a child plots less than the 10th percentile for age and gender, a growth chart for the previous year will be obtained from the child's primary care provider.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"71 Months","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression to Clinically Significant Lower Respiratory Tract Symptoms","description":"Progression to clinically significant lower respiratory tract symptoms defined by: (1) having symptoms that were more than mild after 3 albuterol administrations over 1 hour, or (2) requiring albuterol administrations more often than once every 4 hours, or (3) requiring more than 6 albuterol treatments over a 24-hour period, or (4) having moderate to severe cough or wheeze for 5 or more days since study medication was initiated.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"35","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"57","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"OCELOT: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure","description":"The Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) is a composite outcome with scores ranging from 0-12 with higher numbers representing worse symptoms.
