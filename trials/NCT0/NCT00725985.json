Participants in either the cladribine or placebo group may also enter treatment periods with open-label interferon-beta or open-label cladribine depending upon the disease status. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of two dosage regimens of oral cladribine versus placebo on the time to conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS) (from randomization) according to the Poser criteria in participants with first clinical demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"ITP: Time to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) Conversion Represented by Kaplan-Meier Estimates of the Cumulative Percentage of Participants With CDMS","timeFrame":"ITP: Baseline up to Week 96","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cladribine 5.25 mg/kg (ITP)","deltaMin":15.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cladribine 3.5 mg/kg (ITP)","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo (ITP)","deltaMin":37.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":158,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Belgium","Bosnia and Herzegovina","Bulgaria","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","Finland","France","Georgia","Germany","India","Italy","Lebanon","North Macedonia","Norway","Poland","Portugal","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Arab Emirates","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35019731","35003076","32447743","29051829","24502830"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.emdgroup.com/en/trial-details/?id=28821","https://medical.emdserono.com/en_US/home.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":204},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Lymphopenia","Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
