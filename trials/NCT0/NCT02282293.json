HIV-infected pregnant women between 12 and 28 weeks gestation will be randomized to receive enhanced malaria chemoprevention with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) versus monthly DP placebo. Their HIV-exposed children will receive the same prevention regimen from 2 to 24 months of age to which the mothers were randomized. All women will receive daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) throughout the study per Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines. Children will also receive daily TS from 6 weeks to 24 months of age. TS will be considered a study drug only in infants and children beginning 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding and upon exclusion of HIV infection. Women and their children will be followed for 36 months after delivery. In a subset of the study population, the investigators will conduct an intensive pharmacokinetic study that will evaluate pharmacokinetic exposure of DP and EFV. The investigators will also measure HIV-related outcomes among the women enrolled in the study. The investigators will test the hypothesis that for HIV-infected mothers and HIV-exposed infants, that enhanced versus standard malaria chemoprevention in HIV-infected pregnant women and their children will reduce the incidence of malaria among children from 0 to 24 months of age and improve the development of naturally acquired antimalarial immunity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Placental Malaria","timeFrame":"at delivery estimated to be within 10 to 30 weeks of study entry","effectByArm":[{"arm":"TS + DP Placebo Pregnancy","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Daily TS + Monthly DP Pregnancy","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.50"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28187497","27821443","28329368","28480292","27614925","27717402","29029337","39324693","33020153","30530597","29272443"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":100},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain","Cough","Anemia","Headache","Malaise"]}}
