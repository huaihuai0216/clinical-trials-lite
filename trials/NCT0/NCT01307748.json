EEG FA processing was completed by averaging local reference EEG filtered offline from 0.1 to 70 Hz (with 60 Hz notch filter). 5-min data periods during each time were segmented into 2 seconds epochs, and the semi-automatic artifact rejection was applied. The remaining artifact-free epochs were subjected to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) . The power spectra for individual epochs were averaged, and the measures of EEG spectral density were obtained for alpha band (8 -12.99 Hz). Square root values of power were used, and frontal hemispheric asymmetry was calculated as ((L-R)/(L+R))\\*100, where L and R are square root values at the homologous left and right hemisphere sites (using local average reference values at F3 and F4). With this calculation, FA negative values reflect lower alpha power (higher activation) in the left hemisphere linked to a more positive mood. This is a unit-free measure.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":".013","spread":".027"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":".006","spread":".026"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":".036","spread":".028"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":".005","spread":".028"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-.014","spread":".027"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":".064","spread":".029"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":".031","spread":".027"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-.001","spread":".026"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":".066","spread":".029"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":".009","spread":".026"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":".037","spread":".025"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":".089","spread":".027"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Cognitive Performance: Percent Change From Baseline in Digit Span Backward Task Score","description":"Percent change from baseline in cognitive performance score on the Digit Span Backward (DSB) task.
