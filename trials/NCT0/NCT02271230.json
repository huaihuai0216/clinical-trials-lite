The investigators hypotheses are that both vitamin D and fish oil supplements will each reduce the risk of heart failure.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With New Heart Failure Hospitalization","timeFrame":"5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Vitamin D","deltaMin":240,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vitamin D Placebo","deltaMin":259,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Omega-3 Fatty Acids","deltaMin":244,"sd":null},{"arm":"Omega-3 Fatty Acids Placebo","deltaMin":255,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"50 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1673,"n":12927},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Constipation","Stomach upset or pain","Nausea","Easy bruising"]}}
