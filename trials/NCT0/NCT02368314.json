Willingness of patients of both sexes and their sexual partners with preserved reproductive function to use reliable methods of contraception, starting from screening and up to 4 weeks after the last dose of the studied drug. This requirement does not apply to patients who underwent surgical sterilization. Reliable methods of contraception involves a 1-barrier method combined with one of the following: spermicides/oral contraceptive\n6. Ability of the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, to meet the Protocol requirements.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Hypersensitivity to the components included in the formula of preparation BCD-080 (CJSC BIOCAD) Clexane (Sanofi-Avensis France, France) or medications of the same class\n2. Conditions and diseases in which there is a high risk of bleeding: cerebral aneurysm or aortic dissection, hemorrhagic stroke (including in history)\n3. Intractable hemorrhage\n4. History of documented diseases of blood coagulation (hemophilia A or B, Willebrand disease and other coagulopathies, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia associated with thrombosis or without it, thrombohemorrhagic syndrome, etc.) in anamnesis and/or at the moment of examination\n5. Gastric or duodenal ulcer or other erosive and ulcerative lesions of gastrointestinal tract\n6. Recent ischemic stroke\n7. Uncontrolled severe hypertension; that is, all cases of hypertension, in which blood pressure decrease cannot be achieved with the use of combination of 3 antihypertensive drugs, compulsorily including a diuretic, and non-drug methods of correction (salt-free diet, graduated exercise); or if the results of two successive measurements of supine arterial blood pressure with an interval of 15-30 minutes, systolic blood pressure\\> 180 mm Hg. or diastolic blood pressure\\> 105 mm Hg\n8. Diabetic or hemorrhagic retinopathy\n9. Decompensated diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus complications\n10. Recent delivery (during last 90 days)\n11. Bacterial endocarditis (acute or subacute)\n12. Pericarditis and pericardial effusion\n13. Renal and/or hepatic insufficiency\n14. Intrauterine contraception\n15. Surgeries or injuries of brain/spinal cord, spine, eyes, and major surgeries and injuries within 90 days prior to randomization)\n16. Spinal surgeries or its deformation in history of patients who are planned for epidural/spinal anesthesia\n17. Active liver diseases\n18. Anamnestic information about alcoholism, addiction or drug abuse over the last year\n19. Contraindications to surgeries\n20. Hemoglobin \\<100 g/l\n21. Platelet count \\<100х10\\*9/l\n22.

Necessity for continued treatment with anticoagulants (except for planned under this study), antiaggregant and fibrinolytics (eg, patients with artificial cardiac valve, atrial fibrillation patients receiving warfarin, etc.)\n25. The use of dextrans or fibrinolytic therapy or other drugs affecting hemostasis;\n26. Necessity for use of systemic glucocorticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (except for the use of the latter with the purpose of anaesthesia in the early postoperative period - during 3 days after the planned hip or knee replacement)\n27.
