Subjects were randomized 1:1 to R-CHOP plus enzastaurin or R-CHOP (plus placebo during induction). All subjects received up to 6 cycles (3 weeks per cycle) of treatment. PET/ CT was used to assess radiographic response at the end of treatment. Each subject's treatment assignment was unblinded after combination phase tumor response assessment. Subjects randomized to the enzastaurin arm who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (at investigator's discretion) by Lugano Classification had the opportunity to continue in the single-agent phase of the study and receive single-agent enzastaurin for up to 2 additional years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival in Subjects Who Possess the DGM1™ Biomarker","timeFrame":"Primary Outcome evaluated at 12 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"R-CHOP + Enzastaurin","deltaMin":82,"sd":null},{"arm":"RCHOP + Placebo","deltaMin":87,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32250167"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":75,"n":126},"commonTop":["Anemia","Neutrophil Count Decreased","WBC Decreased","Platelet Count Decreased","Nausea"]}}
