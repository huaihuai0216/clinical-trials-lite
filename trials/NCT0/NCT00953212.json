The opportunity to use ascorbic acid for AF prophylaxis is attractive because of its low side effect profile, wide acceptance and low cost. This prospective, randomized trial used a 2 X 2 factorial design to determine whether prophylactic ascorbic acid alone, ascorbic acid with amiodarone, or amiodarone alone, when given along with beta blockers would decrease the incidence of postoperative AF in adult cardiac surgery when compared with beta blockers alone, all combinations failed to show any difference between the four groups. While there have been trials that have shown the addition of amiodarone to beta-blockers to be more effective, this analysis does not support that conclusion.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"50","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"56","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"58","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"48","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number
