The telemonitoring system is easy to use and ensures the accurate transfer of information from the home to the hospital. The information is then screened and if important changes are seen, the patient will be contacted by a heart failure nurse who will offer advice and may arrange a clinic visit or suggest alterations to the medication. The project uses modern technology to provide disease management, links the patient in their home with the hospital and reinforces education and self-care behaviour. This innovative programme will be tested to see if it reduces the risk of re-admission to hospital, reduces anxiety, improves quality of life following a hospital admission for heart failure and whether this represents good value for money in terms of the health benefits it provides.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nPatients using home telemonitoring of signs and symptoms of heart failure following discharge from hospital with chronic heart failure have a reduced risk of all-cause re-hospitalisation when compared with usual care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Days Alive and Outside of Hospital","timeFrame":"From date of randomisation for 180 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":180,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intervention Arm","deltaMin":178,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":91},"commonTop":["Heart Failure Admission"]}}
