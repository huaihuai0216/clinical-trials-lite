Part of the components of metabolic syndrome and consensus so far contemplated to increased triglycerides (TG) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as part of the elements for classification, which includes mixed dyslipidemia.\n\nCurrently, fibrates, such as bezafibrate, are drugs used in treating hypertriglyceridemia, besides reducing the risk of coronary disease. However, although this treatment is safe, it is not without risks; with increased prevalence of adverse effects as the dose thereof is increased or joins combination with a statin drug for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia long term.\n\nAmong the alternative therapies is berberine, which to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides may be useful in combination with bezafibrate in the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia and as an option with lower cost and lower frequency of adverse events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Triglycerides After 90 Days","timeFrame":"90 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Berberine","deltaMin":2.3,"sd":0.9},{"arm":"Bezafibrate","deltaMin":1.1,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"Berberine Plus Bezafibrate","deltaMin":1.3,"sd":0.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":["Dyspepsia","Headache","Nausea"]}}
