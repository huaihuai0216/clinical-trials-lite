It consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary physical component score (PCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include the PF, RP, BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22.12","spread":"15.315"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24.10","spread":"15.642"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12.12","spread":"14.349"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.48","spread":"15.886"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12.45","spread":"15.979"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.72","spread":"15.290"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13.67","spread":"15.754"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.30","spread":"15.395"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Weeks 16, 24 and 52","description":"The EQ-5D VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical, VAS, with 0 representing the worst imaginable health state and 100 representing the best imaginable health state.
