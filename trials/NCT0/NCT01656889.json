Investigational means that HP802-247 has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nThis research is being done to compare the efficacy of HP802-247 plus compression therapy against Vehicle plus compression therapy in achieving complete wound closure over the 12-week treatment period. Vehicle looks the same as HP802-247 but contains no cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Compare the Treatment Groups for the Proportion of Subjects With Complete Wound Closure Over the 12-Week Treatment Period From Baseline","timeFrame":"12 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HP802-247","deltaMin":129,"sd":null},{"arm":"Vehicle","deltaMin":126,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.5896"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":50,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29037354"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":222},"commonTop":["Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders","Infections and Infestations","Skin Ulcer","Injury, poisoining and procedural complication","Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders"]}}
