Eligible patients attended two screening visits and were booked for arthroscopy approximately 2 weeks later. At that time, patients were randomized to either ACI with ChondroCelect® or to MF, a procedure in which the subchondral bone is perforated to allow a bloodcloth to form scar tissue. Patients randomized to MF had the procedure performed at the time of their arthroscopy; those randomized to ACI with ChondroCelect® had their cells harvested during the arthroscopy and then returned to the clinic approximately 4 weeks later for an open knee procedure, during which the ACI procedure using ChondroCelect® was performed. Patients subsequently followed the same rehabilitation program and had follow-up assessments up to 12 months post-surgery. The 12-month visit was the end-of-study visit for the TIG/ACT/01/2000 protocol. Subject to satisfying the eligibility criteria, patients who had participated in the initial 12 month trial could enter the extension trial. The 12-month visit for the initial study was the baseline visit for the extension study. During the extension study, patients have follow-up assessments up to 60 months post-surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Histomorphometry Safranin-O + Anti-Collagen II Antibody Staining","timeFrame":"12 months post-surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ChondroCelect","deltaMin":1.01,"sd":0.08},{"arm":"Microfracture","deltaMin":0.75,"sd":0.08}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Belgium","Croatia","Germany","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["12507589","12799178","11465712","8078550","14996869","16990391","18202295","19846694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":51},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Influenza","Nasopharyngitis","Cartilage hypertrophy","Joint effusion"]}}
