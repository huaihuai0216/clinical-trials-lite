A participant's blood stem cells will be collected and modified (transduced) using the Lenti-D lentiviral vector encoding human adrenoleukodystrophy protein. After modification (transduction) with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector, the cells will be transplanted back into the participant following myeloablative conditioning. Enrollment and treatment in Study ALD-104 have been completed and further enrollment in this study is not expected, although participants follow-up remains ongoing in the long-term follow-up Study LTF-304 (NCT02698579).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Were Alive and Have None of the 6 Major Functional Disabilities (MFDs) at Month 24","timeFrame":"At Month 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenti-D Drug Product","deltaMin":85.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Italy","Netherlands","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39383458"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":35},"commonTop":["Thrombocytopenia","Stomatitis","Anaemia","Neutropenia","Nausea"]}}
