The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST 1.0) was used to determine disease progression. Irradiated target lesions were considered non-measurable disease. Symptomatic radiographic changes of irradiated non-measurable disease required pathologically confirmation or positive FDG-PET scan 6 months following completion of concurrent chemoradiation to be considered locoregional disease progression. Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression was considered distant disease progression.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival","description":null,"paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percent of Participants Surviving 3 Years","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"41","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Serious Adverse Event Profile Relating to Death, Disability, Life-threatening, Hospitalization, and Impairment/Damage for Concurrent Chemoradiation","description":"Number of participants with treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in each SAE category for each arm relating to death, disability, life-threatening, hospitalization, and impairment/damage is reported.
