Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria for moderate or severe opioid use disorder and/or alcohol use disorder.\n2. Be willing to be randomized to antagonist-based therapy or treatment as usual (TAU) for treatment of opioid and/or alcohol use disorders.\n3. Be HIV-infected as defined by history of positive HIV serology or HIV RNA pcr \\>10,000 copies/mL).\n4. Be willing to establish ongoing HIV care at community treatment program(CTP) if not already receiving ongoing care.\n5. Be willing to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) if not already prescribed ART, regardless of CD4 count.\n6. Be at least 18 years old.\n7. Be able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA (if applicable) for medical record abstraction.\n8. Be able to communicate in English.\n9. If female, be willing to take measures to avoid becoming pregnant.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nIndividuals will be excluded from pilot study participation if they:\n\n* Have a serious medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder that, in the opinion of the study physician, would make study participation hazardous to the participant, compromise study findings, or prevent the participant from completing the study.\n\nExamples include:\n\n1. Disabling or terminal medical illness (e.g., active opportunistic infection, uncompensated heart failure, cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease, acute hepatitis and moderate to severe renal impairment) as assessed by medical history, review of systems, physical exam and/or laboratory assessments;\n\n   1. Severe, untreated or inadequately treated mental health disorder (e.g., active psychosis, uncontrolled manic-depressive illness) as assessed by history and/or clinical interview;\n   2. Current severe benzodiazepine or other depressant or sedative hypnotic use requiring medical detoxification;\n   3. Suicidal or homicidal ideation requiring immediate attention.\n2. Have aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) liver enzymes greater than 5 times upper limit of normal on screening phlebotomy. Results from tests conducted within the past 30 days which are abstracted from medical record information are acceptable.\n3. Have international normalized ratio (INR) \\> 1.5 or platelet count \\<100k. Results from tests conducted within the past 30 days which are abstracted from medical record information are acceptable.\n4. Have known allergy or sensitivity to naloxone, naltrexone, polylactide-co-glycolide, carboxymethylcellulose, or other components of the VivitrolÂ® diluents.\n5. Anticipate undergoing surgery during study participation.\n6. Have chronic pain requiring ongoing pain management with opioid analgesics.\n7. Pending legal action or other reasons that might prevent an individual from completing the study.\n8. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.\n9. Body habitus that, in the judgment of the study physician, precludes safe intramuscular injection of XR-NTX, (e.g. excess fat tissue over the buttocks).\n10. Received methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy for treatment of opioid dependence in the 4 weeks prior to screening.\n11. Have taken an investigational drug in another study within 30 days of study consent.\n12. Have ECG findings that, in the opinion of the study medical clinician would preclude safe participation in the study. Results from ECGs conducted within the past 30 days which are abstracted from medical record information are acceptable.\n13. Have had treatment with XR-NTX for opioid or alcohol dependence in the 3 months prior to screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Successful Initiation of Treatment Within 4 Weeks of Randomization","description":"Successful induction onto XR-NTX or initiation of treatment as usual within 4 weeks of randomization.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Successfully Retained on Pharmacotherapy Treatment at 16 Weeks","description":"Number of participants who received the maximum possible expected doses of XR-NTX, or the full course of recommended pharmacotherapy treatment for treatment as usual (TAU) arm.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"HIV Viral Suppression at 16 Weeks","description":"Plasma HIV viral load of \\< 200 copies/mL compared with screening","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Days of Opioid Use in Past 30 Days","description":"Change in 30 day opioid use by Addiction Severity Index (ASI)-lite self-report and Time-Line Follow Back in the final 30 days of the 16 week trial compared to screening.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.3","spread":"13.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.3","spread":"12.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"5.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.7","spread":"11.32"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"HIV Care Engagement","description":"Change in the proportion of participants prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 16 weeks following randomization, compared to baseline.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Participant Safety: Change in Liver Enzymes Between Baseline and Week 16","description":"Change in liver enzymes between screening and Week 16.
