Age ≥18 years;\n2. Presence of one or more coronary artery stenoses of 50% or more in a native coronary artery or in a saphenous venous or arterial bypass conduit suitable for coronary stent implantation. The vessel should have a reference vessel diameter of at least 2.25 mm (no limitation on the number of treated lesions, vessels, or lesion length);\n3. Able to provide informed consent and willing to participate in 2 year follow- up period.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known intolerance to aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, bivalirudin, stainless steel or biolimus;\n2. Known intake of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, and atazanavir), as co-administration may lead to a substantial increase in exposure to ticagrelor;\n3. Known moderate to severe hepatic impairment (alanine-aminotransferase ≥ 3 x ULN);\n4. Planned surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) as a staged procedure (hybrid) within 12 months of the index procedure, unless dual antiplatelet therapy is maintained throughout the peri-surgical period;\n5. Need for chronic oral anti-coagulation therapy;\n6. Active major bleeding or major surgery within the last 30 days;\n7. Known history of intracranial haemorrhagic stroke or intra-cranial aneurysm;\n8. Known stroke (any type) within the last 30 days;\n9. Known pregnancy at time of randomisation;\n10. Female who is breastfeeding at time of randomisation;\n11.
