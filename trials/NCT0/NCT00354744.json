Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving high-dose combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well giving high-dose combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma or ectomesenchymoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Complete or Partial Response Assessed by RECIST Criteria","timeFrame":"Protocol week 6 evaluation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"High_Risk_Rhabdomyosarcoma","deltaMin":63,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":166,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Puerto Rico","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":108},"commonTop":["Infections and infestations - Other","Febrile neutropenia","Diarrhea","Anorexia","Nausea"]}}
