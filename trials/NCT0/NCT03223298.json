The study hypothesis is that botulinum toxin A injection is superior to placebo. The specific research questions are:\n\n1. Is the injection of botulinum toxin A superior to placebo for the improvement in pain?\n2. Is the injection of botulinum toxin A superior to placebo for the improvement in function or quality of life (QOL)?\n3. Are there any adverse effects that result from injection of botulinum toxin A or placebo into the masseters and temporalis muscles? Limited data exists to support the use of botulinum toxin A in the management of myofascial pain disorder of the masticatory region. Botulinum toxin A is not FDA approved for intra-muscular injection within the masticatory region. Its use in the masticatory region is considered off-label but performed without significant known complications. This study will provide the opportunity to quantitate and qualitate any complications in a large prospective sample of patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Jaw Pain as Reported by Patient on Visual Analog Scale (VAS)","timeFrame":"Pre-intervention, Change at 1 month post-intervention, Change at 2 months post-intervention, Change at 3 months post-intervention","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Botulinum Toxin Type A","deltaMin":58,"sd":15},{"arm":"0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection","deltaMin":54,"sd":14}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.80"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25392894","11010775","10437718","22606852","25062018","12856249","38228287"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":38},"commonTop":["Increase in pain","Headaches","Mild weakness","Masseter tenderness","Ecchymosis"]}}
