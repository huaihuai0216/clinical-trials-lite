Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue that acts as a systemic vasoconstrictor via the vascular vasopressin V1 receptors. In HRS-AKI patients the strong V1 receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor activity of terlipressin, particularly in the splanchnic area, increases effective intravascular volume and mean arterial pressure (MAP), ameliorates renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, and improves renal blood flow. The INFUSE trial will evaluate the use of continuous terlipressin infusion in patients on the liver transplant waiting list with HRS-AKI.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Improvement of Renal Function (SCr) From Day 1 Thru End of Treatment, Repeated Measure Analysis.
