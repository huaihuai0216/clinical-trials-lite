Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel), and ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may block tumor growth by targeting certain cells and slowing the growth of blood vessels to the tumor. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in treating patients with breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival","timeFrame":"Time from randomization to progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 5 years)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Paclitaxel)","deltaMin":10.97,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Nab-paclitaxel)","deltaMin":9.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C (Ixabepilone)","deltaMin":7.36,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.054"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":37,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":704,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39169033","34616010","28620884","26056183"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":65,"n":272},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Neutrophil count decreased","Hypertension","Myalgia"]}}
