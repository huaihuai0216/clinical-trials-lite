Age 21 to 64 years.\n2. Pain with onset within 7 days.\n3. Emergency Department attending physician's judgment that patient's pain warrants use of intravenous opioids.\n4. Normal mental status.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Prior use of methadone.\n2. Use of other opioids, tramadol, or heroin in the past seven days.\n3. Prior adverse reaction to morphine, hydromorphone, or other opioids.\n4. Chronic pain syndrome.\n5. Alcohol intoxication.\n6. Systolic Blood Pressure \\< 90 mm Hg.\n7. Use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors in past 30 days.\n8. Weight less than 100 pounds.\n9. Baseline room air oxygen saturation less than 95%.\n10. C02 measurement greater than 46: In accordance with a number of similar studies that we have performed, four subsets of patients will have their CO2 measured using a handheld capnometer prior to enrollment in the study. If the CO2 measurement is greater than 46, then the patient will be excluded from the study. The 4 subsets are as follows:\n\n    1. All patients who have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n    2. All patients who have a history of sleep apnea\n    3. All patients who report a history of asthma together with greater than a 20 pack-year smoking history\n    4. All patients reporting less than a 20 pack-year smoking history who are having an asthma exacerbation","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"21 Years","maximumAge":"64 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With Successful Treatment","description":"Successful treatment was defined as either declining additional pain medication when asked at 15 minutes or accepting additional pain medication at 15 minutes but then declining additional pain medication at 60 minutes","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"86.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"76.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients Who Did Not Want Additional Pain Medication at 15 Minutes","description":"As defined by the percentage of patients who answer \"no\" to the question, \"Do you want more pain medication?\" at 15 minutes","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"73.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"66.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients Who Did Not Want Additional Pain Medication at 60 Minutes","description":"Patients who did not want pain medication determined by those who answered \"no\" to the question \"do you want more pain medication?\" at 60 minutes after treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"72.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"63.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Changes in Pain Intensity From Baseline to Other Pain Assessment Times (15 and 60 Minutes).","description":"Mean change in pain intensity between baseline and 15 minutes and between baseline and 60 minutes post treatment.
