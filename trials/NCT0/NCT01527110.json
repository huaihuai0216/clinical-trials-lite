ALT or AST \\>=3xULN and bilirubin \\>=2xULN\n  2. ALT \\>=5xULN\n* Underlying chronic liver disease with evidence of severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).\n* History of severe cardiac disease or clinically significant arrhythmia (either on ECG or by history) which, in the opinion of the investigator or sub-investigator, will interfere with the safety of the individual subject.\n* Females who are pregnant (positive urine or serum pregnancy test at Baseline) or are breastfeeding.\n* QT criteria at Baseline as defined below:\n\n  1.
