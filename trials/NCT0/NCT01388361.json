The aim of this trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of adding liraglutide versus addition of insulin aspart with the largest meal to insulin degludec in subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n\nEligible subjects with an HbA1c equal to or above 7% at end of treatment in NN1250-3643 (NCT01193309) trial will be randomised to receive treatment intensification while subjects with an HbA1c below 7% at end of treatment in NN1250-3643 (NCT01193309) may continue to receive insulin degludec treatment. Subjects are to continue their pre-trial metformin treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in HbA1c (%) (Glycosylated Haemoglobin)","timeFrame":"week 0, week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IDeg","deltaMin":0.1,"sd":0.4},{"arm":"IDeg + Liraglutide","deltaMin":-0.74,"sd":0.73},{"arm":"IDeg + IAsp OD","deltaMin":-0.39,"sd":0.72}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":124,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Norway","Serbia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24443830"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":236},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Nausea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Bronchitis"]}}
