This will be a 21-day double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to determine if patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated with 20mM sodium pyruvate in 0.9% sodium chloride nasal spray solution will have reduced chronic coughing, as well as increased lung function (FEV1, FVC endpoints of 12% or more within the first week) and improved FEV1/FVC ratios.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change in Coughing Episodes Per Day From Baseline to Day 21.","timeFrame":"21 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"20mM Sodium Pyruvate Nasal Spray Treatment","deltaMin":-73.2,"sd":8.1},{"arm":"Saline Placebo Control","deltaMin":-16.1,"sd":11}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23734820"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":26},"commonTop":["Nasal Irritation","Nausea","Headache"]}}
