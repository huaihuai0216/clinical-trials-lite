Treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episode is defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4830","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6340","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"162","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Anti-drug Antibodies: Anti-insulin Degludec Antibodies","description":"Insulin degludec (IDeg)-specific antibodies were measured at week 52, as %B/T (percentage of bound \\& precipitated radioactive drug/total added drug to the sample). A sample is measured in 2 different series. In series 1, the radioactive IDeg (tracer) and surplus unlabeled IDeg are added to the sample. In series 2, the tracer and surplus unlabeled human insulin are added to the sample. Series 1 represents unspecific background binding. Series 2 represents IDeg specific antibodies including unspecific background binding. The reported %B/T is calculated by subtracting the background %B/T in series 1 from the %B/T result in series 2. If the background result has higher values than the %B/T in series 2, the resulting value is negative %B/T. Here, a negative %B/T value means that the test samples do not have IDeg-specific antibodies. The reason for getting a negative value for %B/T is due to variation in the analytical background. Thus, the results presented are not a change from baseline.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.12","spread":"3.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.11","spread":"0.42"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Anti-drug Antibodies: Number of Participants Positive or Negative for Anti-liraglutide Antibodies","description":"Anti-liraglutide antibodies were measured at week 52.
