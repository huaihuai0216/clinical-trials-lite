A single line of therapy may consist of 1 or more agents, and may include induction, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and maintenance therapy. Radiotherapy, bisphosphonate, or a single short course of corticosteroids (no more than the equivalent of dexamethasone 40 milligram/day \\[mg/day\\] for 4 days) would not be considered prior lines of therapy\n* Documented multiple myeloma as defined by the criteria below:\n\n  1. Multiple myeloma diagnosis according to the IMWG diagnostic criteria\n  2. Measurable disease at Screening as defined by any of the following:\n\n     1. Serum M-protein level \\>=1.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL) or urine M-protein level \\>=200 mg/24 hours; or\n     2.
