The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called nintedanib helps people with progressive lung fibrosis.\n\nParticipants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. 1 group gets nintedanib as capsules twice a day. The other group gets placebo as capsules twice a day. Placebo capsules look like nintedanib capsules but do not contain any medicine.\n\nParticipants are in the study for about 1 year. During this time, they visit the study site about 10 times. At some visits, participants perform a lung function test. The doctors check whether study treatment can slow down the loss of lung function. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annual Rate of Decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Over 52 Weeks Expressed in Milliliter (mL)","timeFrame":"From baseline up to Week 52.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-191.89,"sd":null},{"arm":"150 mg Nintedanib","deltaMin":-85.32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.mystudywindow.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":27},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","COVID-19","Hepatic function abnormal","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Gamma-glutamyltransferase increased"]}}
