Unapproved medications used in the clinical practice to treat ILD include but are not limited to corticosteroid, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), n-Acetylcysteine (NAC), rituximab, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus\\].\n* Fibrosing lung disease on HRCT, defined as reticular abnormality with traction bronchiectasis with or without honeycombing, with disease extent of \\>10%, performed within 12 months of Visit 1 as confirmed by central readers.\n* For patients with underlying Connective Tissue Disease (CTD): stable CTD as defined by no initiation of new therapy or withdrawal of therapy for CTD within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n* FVC ≥ 45% predicted at Visit 2.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and / or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \\> 1.5 x Upper Level of Normal (ULN) at Visit 1\n* Bilirubin \\> 1.5 x ULN at Visit 1\n* Creatinine clearance \\<30 milliliter (mL)/minute (min) calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula at Visit 1.\n\n\\[Note: Laboratory parameters from Visit 1 have to satisfy the laboratory threshold values as shown above. Visit 2 laboratory results will be available only after randomization. In case at Visit 2 the results do no longer satisfy the entry criteria, the Investigator has to decide whether it is justified that the patient remains on study drug. The justification for decision needs to be documented. Laboratory parameters that are found to be abnormal at Visit 1 are allowed to be re-tested (once) if it is thought to be a measurement error (i.e. there was no abnormal result of this test in the recent history of the patient and there is no related clinical sign) or the result of a temporary and reversible medical condition, once that condition is resolved\\].\n\n* Patients with underlying chronic liver disease (Child Pugh A, B or C hepatic impairment).\n* Previous treatment with nintedanib or pirfenidone.\n* Other investigational therapy received within 1 month or 6 half-lives (whichever was greater) prior to screening visit (Visit 1).\n* Use of any of the following medications for the treatment of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): azathioprine (AZA), cyclosporine, Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus, oral corticosteroids (OCS) \\>20mg/day and the combination of OCS+AZA+ n-Acetylcysteine (NAC) within 4 weeks of Visit 2, cyclophosphamide within 8 weeks of Visit 2, rituximab within 6 months of Visit 2.\n\nNote: Patients whose Regulatory Authority (RA)/Connective Tissue Disease (CTD) is managed by these medications should not be considered for participation in the current study unless change in RA/CTD medication is medically indicated.\n\nFurther exclusion criteria apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Annual Rate of Decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Over 52 Weeks Expressed in Milliliter (mL)","description":"Annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks expressed in milliliter (mL).
