For corticosteroids, a prednisone dose of \\<20 mg/day, or equivalent, is allowed. Inhaled, topical and intra-articular corticosteroids are allowed.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during the study period.\n* Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a non-replicating vaccine within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product.\n* Previous vaccination against VZV or HZ and/or planned administration during the study of an HZ vaccine other than the study vaccine.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy.\n* History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine/product.\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C /100.4°F on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions before Month 4 (i.e. 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine).","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Vaccine Responders for Anti-gE Antibodies as Determined by ELISA","description":"Vaccine response was defined as:\n\nFor initially seronegative subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4 fold the cut-off for anti-gE \\[4x97 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL)\\]; For initially seropositive subjects, antibody concentration at post-vaccination ≥ 4 fold the pre-vaccination antibody concentration.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"74","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"22","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms","description":"Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling.
