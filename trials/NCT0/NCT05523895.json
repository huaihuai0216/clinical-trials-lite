It measures domains of irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity/noncompliance, and inappropriate speech. ABC-I is one of the subscales and comprises of 15 items. Minimum score is 0, maximum is 45. A score for each item ranges from 0 indicating \"not at all a problem\" to 3 indicating \"the problem is severe in degree\". Subscale scores are calculated by summing the items within that subscale. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-9.6","spread":"1.06"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-11.2","spread":"1.09"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-11.2","spread":"1.05"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":78},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Headache","Somnolence","Nausea","Decreased appetite"]}}}
