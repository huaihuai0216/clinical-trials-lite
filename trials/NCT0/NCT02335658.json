The measure is comprised of 30 items and 3 subscales: the Positive subscale assesses hallucinations, delusions, and related symptoms; the Negative subscale assesses emotional withdrawal, lack of motivation, and similar symptoms; and the General Psychopathology subscale addresses other symptoms such as anxiety, somatic concern, and disorientation. An anchored Likert scale from 1 7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms, is used to score each item. Individual items are then summed to determine scores for the 3 subscales, as well as a total score. The PANSS total score is the sum of all 30 items and ranges from 30 through 210. A higher score is associated with greater illness severity.\n\nThe LOCF endpoint is defined as the last data captured on Day 1 through 7 days after the final application of DSP-5423P.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"63.6","spread":"21.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"67.5","spread":"21.34"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.5","spread":"8.41"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-9.2","spread":"15.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.1","spread":"11.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.4","spread":"15.30"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":97},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Application site erythema","Application site pruritus","Akathisia","Insomnia"]}}}
