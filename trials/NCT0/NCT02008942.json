Aspirin's antiplatelet activity is measured by the capacity of platelets to generate serum thromboxane (a surrogate marker for inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin). Inhibition of serum thromboxane is a key marker of antiplatelet efficacy.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"26.71","spread":"62.758"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"64.57","spread":"72.842"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":57},"commonTop":["Upper Respiratory Infection"]}}}
