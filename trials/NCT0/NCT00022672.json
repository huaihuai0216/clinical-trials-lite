Disease progression was defined as the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified or an estimated increase of 25% or more in existent bidimensionally or unidimensionally measurable lesions or progression of an existing non-measurable lesion. For bidimensionally measurable malignant lesions with an area of at least 2.0 centimeters squared (cm\\^2) an increase of 1.0 cm\\^2 was required and for unidimensionally measurable lesions of 1.0 cm or less an increase of 0.5 cm was required. PFS was defined as the number of days between date of randomization and date of documented disease progression or date of death. Kaplan Meier estimates of PFS are presented.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit","description":"Clinical Benefit was defined as stable disease for ≥ six months or complete response or partial response.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"42.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"45.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Duration of Response at 24 Months","description":"Duration of response was defined as the number of days from the day complete response or partial response was first noted to the day of progression of disease, death or last follow-up.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Response at 24 Months","description":"Time to response was defined as the number of days from the day of randomization to the day complete response or partial response was first noted.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival at 24 Months","description":"Overall Survival is defined as the number of days from randomization to death.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"28.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Two-Year Survival","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"45.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Overall Tumor Response at 24 Months","description":"Tumor Response levels were determined by the investigator and an Independent Response Evaluation Committee and Reconciled.
