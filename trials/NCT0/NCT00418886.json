Clinical research has shown that drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling can increase overall survival in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical studies have shown that vandetanib (ZD6474) is an inhibitor of both VEGFR and EGFR signalling. Giving vandetanib may therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells by blocking their blood supply and by stopping them from dividing. This lung cancer study is to investigate if adding vandetanib to Alimta (pemetrexed) is more effective than Alimta (pemetrexed) alone.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population","timeFrame":"RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) from randomization until objective progression","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vandetanib Plus Pemetrexed","deltaMin":17.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Plus Pemetrexed","deltaMin":11.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":110,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Colombia","France","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Philippines","Portugal","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom","Venezuela"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21282537","25881079"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=341&filename=CSR-D4200C00036.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=341&filename=CSR-D4200C00036.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=341&filename=Vandetanib_study_36_ZEAL_CSP_redacted_SECURE.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":84,"n":260},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Rash","Cough","Anorexia"]}}
