In Part 1, patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with Avastin (7.5mg/kg iv) plus cisplatin (75mg/m2 iv) plus pemetrexed (500mg/m2 iv) on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. In Part 2, patients responding to treatment will be randomized to receive further treatment cycles of Avastin (7.5mg/kg iv every 3 weeks) with or without pemetrexed (500mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks). Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression.
