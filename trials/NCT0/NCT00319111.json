Area used for testing had to be a minimum of 30m in length and 2-3m in width, with 3m gradations. Areas were well ventilated with air temperature controlled. The test was administered at the same time of day and by the same tester throughout the study. The tester measured the distance walked by non-encouraged patients during the timed 6min period. If the test was stopped before 6 minutes, the main reason for stopping the test was recorded. The tester measured the distance walked by patients during the timed 6min period.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.4","spread":"66.4"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.2","spread":"64.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.7","spread":"63.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.2","spread":"64.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.9","spread":"69.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline to All Assessed Time Points in Borg Dyspnea Index","description":"Maximal dyspnea during the walk test was assessed by the patient using the Borg dyspnea index.
