Patients with symptomatic, severe aortic valve stenosis conventionally have it surgically replaced requiring direct access to the heart through the chest. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now a well-established alternative for treating severe aortic valve stenosis. Both types of intervention improve prognosis and alleviate symptoms.\n\nThe optimal choice of blood thinning therapy after TAVR is unknown. It has been reported that leaflet thrombosis with reduced leaflet motion can occur and this phenomenon has been suggested to be potentially related with neurological events. In addition, the occurence of this phenomenon can be reduced with anticoagulation blood thinning therapy.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate if anticoagulation compared to the usual double platelet inhibitor therapy after TAVR can reduce the risk of leaflet thrombosis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Patients With at Least One Prosthetic Leaflet With >50% Motion Reduction as Assessed by Cardiac 4DCT-scan","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ASA + Clopidogrel","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"Rivaroxaban + ASA","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.01"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","Germany","Netherlands","Sweden","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26436963","31733182"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":116},"commonTop":["minor bleeding"]}}
