Euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamps were conducted at baseline and at the end of the study. Because salsalate therapy appears to decrease insulin clearance leading to higher circulating insulin levels during the clamp, we reduced the infusion rate of insulin in the active treatment arm by 20% (from 100 to 80 mUm-2 min-1) at the study end. Insulin solutions were prepared by the site pharmacist so that study staff remained blinded to drug assignment. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was estimated from glucose infusion rate (GIR) during last 30 min of insulin infusions.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Glucose Area Under the Curve in These Subjects","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.98","spread":"1.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.74","spread":"1.33"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Plasma CRP","description":"Plasma C-reactive protein was measured by PVAHS clinical laboratory.
