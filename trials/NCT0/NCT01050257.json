Adult and adolescent patients will be randomized to receive either 100 mg or 200 mg of study drug intravenously every 12 hours. Investigators and patients are blinded to knowledge of the assigned dose of Tamiflu. There is an option to convert to oral Tamiflu after 6 intravenous infusions. The anticipated time on study treatment is 5 days, with an optional treatment extension of a further 5 days, if necessary. There will be a non-randomized, open-label treatment group for patients with moderate/severe renal impairment or renal failure. Intravenous dose levels and frequency will be adjusted appropriately to their renal situation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events(SAEs, AEs Leading to Withdrawal, and Death","timeFrame":"Up to 30 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oseltamivir (TAMIFLU®) 100 mg","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oseltamivir (TAMIFLU®) 200 mg","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Oseltamivir Open Label","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":96,"countries":["United States","Denmark","France","Hungary","Italy","Lithuania","Poland","Romania","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":48},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Headache","Infusion site pain","Constipation"]}}
