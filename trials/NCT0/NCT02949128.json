Participants had to meet these criteria for 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between.

Formal statistical comparison analyses were not planned for this study. The percentage was based on the responders among treated participants. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was based on the asymptotic Gaussian approximation method with a continuity correction.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"83.9","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"58.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time To Complete TMA Response","description":"Participants that did not have a response were censored at the date of last visit or study discontinuation at the time when the analysis was performed.
