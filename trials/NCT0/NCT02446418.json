Pivotal phase III studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of FF/VI in asthma. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that randomised clinical trials tend to be highly controlled and enrol a more highly selected subject population than is expected to be prescribed the medication post-approval. There is a need for data in a more representative population in close to a 'real life' conditions, where physicians have the ability to choose the best treatment in their view for any individual subject and adapt treatments to subjects' characteristics and response. This multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of FF/VI compared with two usual ICS/LABA fixed combination (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol \\[FP/S\\] or budesonide/formoterol \\[BUD/F\\]) in subjects with persistent asthma, in a \"close to real life\" settings. FF/VI will be administered once-daily (QD) via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler (DPI) and FP/S or BUD/F will be administered twice daily (BID) via DISKUS™ and TURBUHALER™ DPI respectively. ELLIPTA is a new powder inhaler designed to be easy to use. The total duration of subject participation will be approximately 6 months (24 weeks).
