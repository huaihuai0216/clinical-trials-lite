the open-label run-in treatment period.\n* current treatment with any antihypertensive agents, whether or not prescribed for this indication, that cannot be safely stopped (investigator¿s decision) by the start of the run-in period.\n* chronic administration of any medication known to affect blood pressure, other than the trial medication.\n* any other clinical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe completion of the protocol and safe administration of telmisartan and amlodipine.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
