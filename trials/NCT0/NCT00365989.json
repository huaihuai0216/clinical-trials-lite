Women age 18 or older, who present with symptomatic fibroids\n2. Women who have given written informed consent\n3. Women who are able and willing to attend all study visits.\n4. Patient is pre or peri-menopausal (within 12 months of last menstrual period).\n5. Able to communicate sensations during the ExAblate procedure.\n6. Uterine fibroids, which are device accessible (i.e., positioned in the uterus such that they can be accessed without being shielded by bowel or bone).\n7. Fibroids(s) clearly visible on non-contrast MRI.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Women who are pregnant, as confirmed by serum test at time of screening, or urine pregnancy test on the day of treatment\n2. Patient who desire to become pregnant in the future.\n3. Patients who are breast-feeding.\n4. Patients with an active pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\n5. Active local or systemic infection\n6. Metallic implants that are incompatible with MRI\n7. Known intolerance to the MRI contrast agent (e.g. Gadolinium or Magnevist)\n8. Severe claustrophobia that would prevent completion of procedure in the MR unit.\n9. Extensive abdominal scarring in the beam pass or dermoid cyst of the ovary anywhere in the treatment path.\n10. Known or suspected pelvic carcinoma or pre-malignant conditions, including sarcoma and adenomatous hyperplasia.\n11. Pedunculated fibroids.\n12. Intrauterine device (IUD) anywhere in the treatment path\n13.
