has had a successful vasectomy):\n\n  * Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives (for a minimum of three months before study entry) in combination with a condom;\n  * Intrauterine device in combination with a condom;\n  * Double barrier method (condom\\* and occlusive cap \\[diaphragm or cervical/vault caps\\] with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).\n* Willing, able and competent to complete the entire study and to comply with instructions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with past history within last 12 months or current episode of severe constipation (requiring repeated use of laxatives/enema or physical intervention before resolution), known or suspected ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon.\n* Patients with ongoing severe acute Inflammatory Bowel Disease.\n* Patients who have had previous significant gastrointestinal surgeries, including colonic resection, sub-total colectomy, abdomino-perineal resection, de-functioning colostomy, Hartmann's procedure and de-functioning ileostomy or other similar surgeries involving structure and function of the small or large colon.\n* Regular use of laxatives or colon motility altering drugs in the last month (i.e. more than 2-3 times per week) and/or laxative use within 72 hours prior to administration of the preparation.\n* Patients with active intestinal bleeding episodes or with a clinically significant low hemoglobin level \\<9 g/dL for women and \\<11 g/dL for men at screening.\n* Known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\n* Known phenylketonuria.\n* Known hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycols, ascorbic acid and sulfates (not including sulfa-based products), sodium picosulfate and magnesium salt compounds, or any other component of the study drug or comparator\n* Past history within the last 12 months or evidence of any on-going clinically relevant electrocardiogram abnormalities (e.g. arrhythmias).\n* History of uncontrolled hypertension with systolic blood pressure \\>170 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure \\>100 mmHg.\n* Patients with cardiac insufficiency NYHA grades III or IV.\n* Patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (i.e. with GFR, \\<60 mL/min/1.73m2).\n* Patient with serum albumin \\<3.4 g/dL.\n* Patients with liver disease of grades B and C according to the Child Pugh classification.\n* Patients suffering from dehydration at screening as evaluated by the Investigator from physical examination and laboratory investigations.\n* Patients with clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities, whether pre-existing or noted at screening, such as hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypermagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcaemia, dehydration, or those secondary to the use of diuretics or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\n* Patients with any other clinically significant hematological parameters including coagulation profile at screening.\n* Patients with impaired consciousness that might predispose them to pulmonary aspiration.\n* Patients undergoing colonoscopy for foreign body removal and/or decompression.\n* Patients who are pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study.\n* Clinically relevant findings on physical examination based on the Investigator's judgment.\n* History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing.\n* Concurrent participation in an investigational drug or device study or participation within three months of study entry.\n* Patients who are ordered to live in an institution on court or authority order.\n* Patients with history of rhabdomyolysis","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
