A vomiting episode is defined as an episode of forceful expulsion of stomach contents. Retching if a patient has already emptied his or her gastric contents is also considered vomiting episode. A distinct episode is characterized by a clear break in vomiting activity of at least 5 minutes\n* Emesis must have been nonbloody (streaks of blood presumed due to force of retching are allowed)\n* All patients (and a parent or guardian for patients \\<age 18) must sign informed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe dehydration. Severe dehydration is defined as two or more of the following criteria in the presence of decreased intake and increased output due to vomiting or diarrhea: Absent or severely decreased urine output; weak pulse and/or low blood pressure; parched mucous membranes; lethargy, confusion, delirium or loss of consciousness\n* Signs and symptoms severe enough to require immediate parenteral hydration and/or parenteral antiemetic medication\n* Temperature\\>39.0\n* Likely etiologies for acute vomiting and diarrhea other than acute infectious or toxic gastroenteritis or gastritis. This includes signs of an acute abdomen, which may require surgical intervention\n* Chemically-induced gastroenteritis, e.g., from alcohol, other drugs of abuse or other irritant chemicals\n* Use within 24 hours of study entry of specific medication for treatment of nausea and/or vomiting, e.g., 5-HT3 antagonists or phenothiazines, or receipt of any IV fluid for any reason. Nonspecific gastrointestinal remedies, such as antacids, proton pump inhibitors and homeopathic remedies, are permitted.\n* Congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia (baseline pulse\\<55/min), known long QT syndrome\n* Patient who have known QTc prolongation \\> 450 msec, noted on prior or screening ECG, or who are taking medication known to cause QT prolongation. Note: for current list of medications known to cause QT prolongation see: https://www.crediblemeds.org/healthcare-providers/drug-list/ Use list showing drugs with known risk TdP.\n* Known underlying disease which could affect assessment of hydration or modify outcome of treatment, e.g., renal failure, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, alcoholism. Patients with type 2 diet-controlled diabetes mellitus whose baseline blood glucose is \\<200 may be entered into the study\n* Abdominal surgery within the past 3 months\n* History of bariatric surgery or bowel obstruction at any time\n* Hypersensitivity or other known intolerance to ondansetron or other 5-HT3 antagonists\n* Patient has taken apomorphine within 24 hours of screening\n* Patient has previously participated in this study\n* Patient has participated in another interventional clinical trial, for any indication, in the past 30 days\n* For women of childbearing potential: documented or possible pregnancy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Treatment Success From 30 Minutes Through 24 Hours After First Dose of Study Medication - ITT Population","description":"Number of patients without further vomiting, without rescue medication, and who were not given intravenous hydration from 30 minutes post first dose until 24 hours post dose","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"126","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"70","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"114","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"65","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Responders Through 4 Days After First Dose of Study Medication - ITT Population","description":"Treatment success, as defined in the primary outcome, through 4 days following first dose of study medication.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"114","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"67","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Vomited - ITT Population","description":"Analysis of vomiting from 30 minutes after first administration of study medication until 24 hours post first dose","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"33","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"131","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"71","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Patients Receiving Rescue Antiemetic Therapy - ITT Population","description":"Patients receiving rescue antiemetic therapy within 24 hours after the first dose of study medication.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"48","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"43","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Patients Receiving Intravenous Fluids - ITT Population","description":"Patients receiving parenteral hydration within 24 hours after the first dose of study medication.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"34","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"32","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Severity of Nausea at Baseline - ITT Population","description":"Severity of nausea was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale: 0=no nausea; 1=mild nausea; 2=moderate nausea; 3=severe nausea; 4=nausea as bad as can be.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.8","spread":"1.03"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.6","spread":"1.02"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.1","spread":"1.10"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.3","spread":"1.16"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.8","spread":"0.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.9","spread":"1.07"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.5","spread":"0.85"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.8","spread":"1.05"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.4","spread":"0.75"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":"1.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.2","spread":"0.49"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Incidence and Severity of Diarrhea - ITT Population","description":"Severity of diarrhea for patients having bowel movements was assessed using the Bristol Stool Scale (\"BSS\"), a Likert scale rating bowel movements from 1=separate hard lumps, like nuts, to 7=watery, no solid pieces; entirely liquid.
