The investigators hypothesize that 12 months of denosumab administration will result in an increase in bone mineral density, decrease in markers of bone resorption and improvement in bone microarchitecture in osteopenic women with anorexia nervosa compared with placebo.\n\nAn optional extension study will offer subjects 12-month administration of open-label alendronate (an oral bisphosphonate) after the initial 12 month administration of denosumab or placebo. We hypothesize that 12 months of denosumab followed by 12 months of open-label alendronate will result in a greater increase in BMD compared to 12 months of placebo followed by 12 months of open-label alendronate. Within the group of women who receive sequential therapy with 12 months of denosumab followed by 12 months of alendronate, we hypothesize that BMD will be maintained between 12 and 24 months while on alendronate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Postero-anterior (PA) Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)","timeFrame":"12 months (Period 1)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Denosumab (0-12 Months) Followed by Alendronate (12-24 Months)","deltaMin":0.9,"sd":0.03},{"arm":"Placebo (0-12 Months) Followed by Alendronate (12-24 Months)","deltaMin":0.87,"sd":0.04}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.009"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":["constipation","COVID-19","bone fracture","nausea/stomach pain/bloating","Keratitis"]}}
