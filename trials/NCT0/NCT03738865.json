The study involves two daytime clinical research center (CRC) visits with random assignment to receive G-Pen glucagon 1 mg during one period and Novo Glucagon 1 mg during the other. Each daytime visit is preceded by an overnight stay in the CRC. In the morning of the inpatient study visit, the subject is brought into a state of severe hypoglycemia through IV administration of regular insulin diluted in normal saline. After a hypoglycemic state with plasma glucose \\< 54 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) is verified, the subject is administered a dose of G-Pen or Novo Glucagon via subcutaneous injection. Plasma glucose levels are monitored for up to 180 minutes post-dosing, with a value of \\>70.0 mg/dL (3.89 mmol/L) or an increase of \\> 20 mg/dL (\\>1.11 mmol/L) within 30 minutes of glucagon administration indicating a positive response. After 3 hours, the subject is given a meal and discharged when medically stable. After a wash-out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects return to the CRC, and the procedures are repeated with each subject crossed over to the other treatment. A follow-up visit as a safety check is conducted 2-7 days following administration of the final dose of study drug.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Severe Hypoglycemia Rescue","timeFrame":"At 30 minutes following administration of study drug","effectByArm":[{"arm":"G-Pen","deltaMin":127,"sd":null},{"arm":"Novo Glucagon","deltaMin":123,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States","Austria","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35322535"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":127},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Headache"]}}
