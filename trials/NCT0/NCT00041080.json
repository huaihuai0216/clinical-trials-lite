Estrogen can stimulate the growth of some types of cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight cancer by blocking the uptake of estrogen. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether thalidomide is more effective than tamoxifen in treating ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Median Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"from enrollment onto the study until first disease progression or death due to any cause","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Grp - 1","deltaMin":3.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Grp - 2","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":36,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":67},"commonTop":["Gastrointestinal","Constitutional","Pain","Peripheral neurologic","Other neurologic"]}}
