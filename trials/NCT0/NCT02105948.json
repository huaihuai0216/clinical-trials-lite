It is hypothesized that the reduction of eosinophils with mepolizumab in COPD patients would translate into a reduction of COPD exacerbations. The study will determine the reduction in exacerbations in subjects who are above and below the baseline blood eosinophil count of at least 150 cells/microlitres. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab on the frequency of moderate and severe exacerbations in COPD subjects at high risk of exacerbations, despite the use of optimized standard of care background therapy.\n\nOverall in this study, a total of 800 subjects will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or mepolizumab (100 milligram (mg)) administered SC. The total duration of this study will be approximately 62 weeks, consisting of a 1 to 2 week screening period, 52-week treatment period and 8-week follow-up period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Moderate or Severe Exacerbations in Participants in the High Stratum","timeFrame":"From randomization to Week 52","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo - High Stratum","deltaMin":1.71,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mepolizumab 100 mg - High Stratum","deltaMin":1.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.036"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"=0.029"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":116,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","Estonia","France","Greece","Italy","Mexico","Norway","Peru","Poland","Russia","Spain","Sweden"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34163157","31295674","28893134"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":80,"n":229},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Back pain","Upper respiratory tract infection","Oropharyngeal pain"]}}
