CME = any symptom rated as severe (3) or very severe (4), with the exception of confusion. A total CME score was calculated by summing the number of CMEs across symptoms and ranged from 0 to 9. CME was counted for either nausea or vomiting/retching, or both and reported in this outcome measure.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":124},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Pyrexia","Pruritus","Constipation"]}}}
