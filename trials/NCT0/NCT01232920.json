They will be followed monthly for 6 months after enrollment or until treatment failure. The investigators hypothesize that the proportion achieving corticosteroid-sparing success at 6 months for patients taking mycophenolate mofetil will be improved in comparison with patients taking methotrexate.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Achieving Treatment Success","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methotrexate","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Mycophenolate Mofetil","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.09"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28414043"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":41},"commonTop":["Headache","Fever for 12 hours","Nausea","Diarrhea","Cataract"]}}
