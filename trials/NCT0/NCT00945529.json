This study will examine the use inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) given for 54 hours after Fontan operation to improve fluid balance. The study hypothesis is that inhaled nitric oxide after Fontan operation will improve fluid balance, thus decreasing the incidence of pleural effusions and shortening hospital stay.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Length of Hospital Stay Following Fontan","timeFrame":"until hospital discharge","effectByArm":[{"arm":"No Intervention/ Historical Control Group","deltaMin":11.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":11,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":23},"commonTop":["Pleural effusion requiring drainage"]}}
