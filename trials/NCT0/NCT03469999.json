Scores range from 0, which indicates no resistance throughout the course of the passive movement (better outcome), to 5, which indicates that the joint is immovable (worse outcome). The first measure determines the maximum range of motion of a target muscle group in degrees and the second measure determines the angle where muscle resistance is felt during a rapid velocity stretch, recorded in degrees. The total score is calculated by subtracting measure one from measure two. A greater difference between measures indicates less muscle spasticity. The Modified Tardieu Scale will be performed in the hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Score on the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life (CP QOL) Questionnaire","description":"The Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life (CP QOL) Questionnaire consists of 66 items ranging from 1 to 9 with a lower score indicating a higher quality of life. The total score will be calculated as well as an individual score for the seven subscale domains: Social well-being and acceptance, functioning, Participation and physical health, Emotional well-being, Access to services, pain and feeling about disability, and family health. Scoring involves 2 steps. First, items are transformed to a scale with a possible range of 0-100. The scores are recoded as follows 1 to 0, 2 to 12.5, 3 to 25, 4 to 37.5, 5 to 50, 6 to 6.2, 7 to 75, 8 to 87.5, 9 to 100. Then the algebraic mean of item values is computed from the composite score for each domain. Once rescored, the final score ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating a worse outcome.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":12},"commonTop":[]}}}
