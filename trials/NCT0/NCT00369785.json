Must be stable in the 3 months prior to enrollment.\n* Must not be receiving chemotherapy at the time of enrollment.\n* Patient must not have any planned therapy, including surgery, brain radiation of any type, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy during the next 30 weeks for brain or extracranial primary metastatic disease.\n* Hormonal therapy for patients with breast or prostate cancer is acceptable.\n* Breast patients receiving therapy with Herceptin are allowed.\n* Patients must be able to give informed consent to participate in the study, including signing the consent form.\n* Patients must have a telephone.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients cannot be currently taking dementia drugs, cognitive enhancers, neuroleptics, and/or anti-parkinsonian agents. For patients who have used these drugs in the past, they must not have used them in the 2 weeks prior to enrolling on the study.\n* Hypersensitivity to donepezil.\n* Patients may not currently be taking Ketoconazole or Quindine\n* Arrythmias including bradycardia or heartblock\n* Patients who have received, GliaSite or other type of brain brachytherapy, (Gliadel Wafers permitted) convection enhanced delivery of immunotoxins, and/or any other investigational modalities for treatment of their brain tumor. The effects of donepezil on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* It is unknown whether donepezil is excreted in breast milk, for this reason women who are currently breast-feeding are not eligible for this study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Memory as Quantified by HVLT-immediate Recall","description":"Memory is quantified using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) - immediate recall.
