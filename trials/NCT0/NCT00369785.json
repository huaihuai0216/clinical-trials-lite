It is not yet known whether donepezil is more effective than a placebo in lessening side effects of radiation therapy in patients with brain tumors.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying donepezil to see how well it works in lessening side effects of radiation therapy compared with a placebo in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for brain tumors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Memory as Quantified by HVLT-immediate Recall","timeFrame":"24 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I - Donepezil","deltaMin":22.5,"sd":0.45},{"arm":"Arm II - Control","deltaMin":22.2,"sd":0.45}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".62"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":16,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":96},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Headache","Insomnia","Memory Impairment","Muscle Cramps"]}}
