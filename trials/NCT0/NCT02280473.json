The conjunctiva is the clear membrane covering the white surface of the eye. The cornea is divided into 5 zones and the nasal and temporal conjunctiva is divided into 6 zones. The combined staining score is based on the sum of the five zones on the cornea and the six zones on the conjunctiva. Each zone is graded on a 0-5 scale (0=None; 1=trace; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=severe; 5=very severe), for a total score ranging from 0-55. The higher the score, the worse the dry eye condition.
