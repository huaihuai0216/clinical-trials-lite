The participant's parent or the participant's legal guardian is capable of signing and dating a written, informed consent form on behalf of the participant prior to the initiation of any study procedures. Written informed assent is also obtained from the participant as much as possible.\n3. The Japanese participant who has a diagnosis of hypertension. A participant is eligible if he/she is deemed hypertensive according to the Reference Blood Pressure Values of Children by Gender and Age; office sitting diastolic or systolic blood pressure ≥ 95 percentile for essential hypertension without concomitant hypertensive organ damage, and ≥ 90 percentile for secondary hypertension with concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus, heart failure or any hypertensive organ damage.\n\n   In addition, participants need to meet the following criteria:\n\n   \\- If currently treated with any antihypertensive drugs at the start of the Run-in Period: Participant has a documented historical diagnosis of hypertension and an office sitting diastolic or systolic blood pressure meeting the above criteria at the end of the Run-in Period (Week 0).\n\n   \\- If currently untreated with any antihypertensive drugs at the start of the Run-in Period: Participant who meets the above criteria on 3 separate time points including screening and the end of the Run-in Period (Week 0). In addition, participant with essential hypertension without concomitant hypertensive organ damage still maintains hypertension with non-pharmacotherapy including foods or exercises for at least 3 months within 1 year prior to the start of screening.\n4.

The participant has hemodynamically significant left ventricular outflow obstruction due to aortic stenosis or aortic valvular disease, or is scheduled to undergo a medical procedure affecting blood pressure during the study (eg, correction of arterial anomaly).\n9. The participant has a history of or concurrent clinically significant abnormality of 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator, disqualifies the participant for participation in the study.\n10. The participant has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus indicated by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) \\> 9.0% at screening.\n11. The participant has an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level ≥ 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or a total bilirubin level ≥ 1.5 × ULN at screening, severely impaired hepatic function, any active liver disease (regardless of the cause), or jaundice.\n12. The participant has hyperkalemia exceeding ULN at screening.\n13. The participant has a history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at screening.\n14.
