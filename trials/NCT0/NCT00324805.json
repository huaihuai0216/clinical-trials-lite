Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab also may stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating non-small cell lung cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From registration to death, up to 10 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Chemotherapy)","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Chemotherapy, Bevacizumab)","deltaMin":85.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.90"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":29,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1169,"countries":["United States","Canada","Ireland","Peru","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29129443"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":424,"n":738},"commonTop":["Neutrophil count decreased","Anemia","Creatinine increased","Fatigue","Peripheral sensory neuropathy"]}}
