This exception included monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and multivalent influenza vaccines.\n* Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months.\n* Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or another vaccine (i.e., mono- or polyvalent, polysaccharide, or Conjugate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroups A, C, W, or Y; or meningococcal B vaccine).\n* Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).\n* History of meningococcal infection, confirmed either clinically, serologically, or microbiologically\n* At high risk for meningococcal infection during the trial (specifically, but not limited to, participants with persistent complement deficiency, with anatomic or functional asplenia, or participants travelling to countries with high endemic or epidemic disease).\n* Known systemic hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the study or to a vaccine containing any of the same substances .\n* Personal history of an Arthus-like reaction after vaccination with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine.\n* Personal history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Thrombocytopenia, as reported by the parent/ legally acceptable representative or suspected thrombocytopenia contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants in the 3 weeks preceding inclusion, contraindicating intramuscular vaccination in the Investigator's opinion.\n* Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, was at a stage where it might interfere with trial conduct or completion.\n* Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to Investigator judgment) on the day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature \\>= 38.0 degree Celsius). A prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition had resolved or the febrile event had subsided.\n* Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first blood draw.\n* Identified as a natural or adopted child of the Investigator or employee with direct involvement in the proposed study.\n\nThe above information was not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a participant's potential participation in a clinical trial.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Months","maximumAge":"23 Months","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Antibody Titers >=1:8 Against Meningococcal Serogroup C Measured by Serum Bactericidal Assay Using Human Complement (hSBA) Following Vaccination With MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine or Nimenrix® (Non-inferiority Analysis)","description":"Antibody titers against Meningococcal Serogroup C were measured by hSBA.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"99.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"89.1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Antibodies Against Meningococcal Serogroup C Measured by hSBA Following Vaccination With MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine or Nimenrix® (Non-inferiority Analysis)","description":"GMT titers against Meningococcal Serogroup C were measured by hSBA.
