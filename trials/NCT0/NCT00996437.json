Blood pressure \\> 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110). Myocardial infarction, other cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4 months prior to randomization.\n\nSystemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.\n\nFor women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant within the next 4 months.\n\nSubject is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not covered by another clinical center during the 12 months of the study.\n\nStudy Eye Criteria\n\nThe subject must have at least one eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed below.\n\nA subject can have only one study eye. If both eyes are eligible at the time of randomization, the study eye will be selected by the investigator and subject before randomization.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:\n\nInclusion\n\nVitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and precluding completion of panretinal photocoagulation (or precluding assessment of completeness of prior PRP).\n\nImmediate vitrectomy not required (investigator and subject are willing to wait at least 8 weeks to see if hemorrhage clears sufficiently without having to proceed to vitrectomy).\n\nVisual acuity is light perception or better.\n\nExclusion\n\nPrompt vitrectomy indicated, such as because of signs of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or traction detachment involving the macula present on ultrasound.\n\nExam evidence of neovascular glaucoma, angle neovascularization, or active neovascularization of the iris (small iris tufts not an exclusion).\n\nHistory of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment for vitreous hemorrhage at any time in the past or for an indication other than vitreous hemorrhage in the past 2 months.\n\nHistory of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery other than vitrectomy anticipated within the next 6 months following randomization.\n\nHistory of vitrectomy. History of yttrium aluminum garnet capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.\n\nAphakia. Uncontrolled glaucoma (in investigator's judgment). Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or substantial blepharitis.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Treatment or \"Failure\" Defined as Vitrectomy","description":"The cumulative probabilities of vitrectomy by 16 weks (112 days) in each group were computed using the life-table method.
