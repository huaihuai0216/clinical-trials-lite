Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.87","spread":"7.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.99","spread":"7.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.57","spread":"6.79"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.84","spread":"7.32"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.07","spread":"6.82"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.56","spread":"8.36"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.61","spread":"6.78"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.52","spread":"7.93"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.32","spread":"9.77"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.04","spread":"9.53"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.33","spread":"10.07"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.20","spread":"9.54"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.26","spread":"6.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.36","spread":"6.56"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.47","spread":"7.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.86","spread":"7.66"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.66","spread":"7.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.49","spread":"7.60"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.83","spread":"7.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.15","spread":"7.48"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.50","spread":"7.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.54","spread":"8.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.18","spread":"8.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.54","spread":"8.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.67","spread":"9.47"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.53","spread":"9.49"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.30","spread":"9.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.42","spread":"9.93"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.94","spread":"8.06"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.03","spread":"8.70"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.29","spread":"8.71"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.03","spread":"9.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.53","spread":"6.36"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.21","spread":"6.39"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.44","spread":"6.26"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.36","spread":"6.50"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.83","spread":"7.54"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.23","spread":"8.40"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.35","spread":"8.36"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.09","spread":"8.64"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in CoEQ: Scores From the 4 Domains and the 19 Items","description":"Change from baseline (week 0) in Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) was evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. The CoEQ comprised 19 items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings, as well as subjective sensation of appetite and mood, with the 4 domains: 'craving control' (items 9-12, 19), 'positive mood' (items 5-8), 'craving for savoury' (items 4, 16-18) and 'craving for sweet' (items 3, 13-15). The 19 items were scored on an 11-point graded response scale ranging from 10 to 0, with items relating to each of the 4 domains being averaged to create a final score. A low score in the domains 'craving for sweet and 'craving for savoury' represents a low level of craving; whereas a high score in the domains 'craving control' and 'positive mood' represents good control and a good mood, respectively.
