The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1=\"none\", 2=\"mild\", 3=\"moderate\", 4=\"severe\" and 5=\"very severe\" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":147},"commonTop":["Headache","Breast pain","Rash acneiform","Hirsutism","Voice alteration"]}}}
