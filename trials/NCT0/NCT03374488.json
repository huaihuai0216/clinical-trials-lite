A participant who receives a neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum-containing regimen following cystectomy for localized muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma is acceptable (without further systemic treatment), if recurrence/progression occurs â‰¤ 12 months following completion of therapy.\n* Measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1.\n* Have provided an archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated for PD-L1 analysis.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.\n* Adequate organ function per protocol-defined criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Urothelial carcinoma that is suitable for local therapy with curative intent.\n* History or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's opinion, is clinically meaningful.\n* Known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment within the past 3 years.\n* Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically stable, ie, without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging.\n* Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV testing is not required unless mandated by local health authority.\n* Known history of or is positive for active hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or has active hepatitis C (HCV RNA). Note: Testing must be performed to determine eligibility.\n* Use of protocol-defined prior/concomitant therapy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Objective Response Rate (ORR) With Pembrolizumab + Epacadostat Versus Pembrolizumab + Placebo","description":"ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a complete response (CR), disappearance of all target lesions or partial response (PR), \\>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions per RECIST v1.1 by investigator determination.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21.4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Safety and Tolerability of Pembrolizumab + Epacadostat Versus Pembrolizumab + Placebo as Measured by Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs)","description":"AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"42","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"39","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Safety and Tolerability of Pembrolizumab + Epacadostat Versus Pembrolizumab + Placebo as Measured by Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due to AE","description":"AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":42},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Constipation","Decreased appetite","Fatigue","Nausea"]}}}
