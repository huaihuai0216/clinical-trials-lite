Thirty subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either DTG 50mg BID (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B) with the current failing regimen for 7 days (RAL or ELV should be discontinued prior to dosing with DTG). At Day 8, subjects from both arms will enter an open label phase and receive open label DTG 50mg BID with an optimized background regimen containing at least one fully active drug.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) at Day 8","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DTG 50 mg BID","deltaMin":-1.06,"sd":0.168},{"arm":"Placebo BID in DB Phase; DTG 50 mg BID in Open-label Phase","deltaMin":0.1,"sd":0.183}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25321146"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":14},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Depression"]}}
