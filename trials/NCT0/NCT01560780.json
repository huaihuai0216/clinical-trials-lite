The primary goal of the study is to determine whether prasugrel administration will prevent thrombus (clot) formation within a saphenous vein graft at 12 months, as examined by optical coherence tomography.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Prevalence of Intragraft Thrombus at 12-month Follow-up Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Prasugrel","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Placebo","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.78"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":9,"n":42},"commonTop":[]}}
