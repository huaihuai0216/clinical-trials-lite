Lower score indicates fewer schizophrenic symptoms. CGI-S is 7-point scale,measures severity of participant's illness in comparison with others with same diagnosis. Lower score indicates less severe illness. 25th percentile for time to relapse was reported.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"92","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"224","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":50,"n":765},"commonTop":["Akathisia","Insomnia","Headache","Restlessness","Extrapyramidal disorder"]}}}
