For children with delayed development, which is the case for children with Down Syndrome, Quotient tables could be not used because sub- and General quotient floors at 50. For each subscale, a raw score was derived from the contributing items. Total raw score was obtained by adding subscale raw scores. Sum of all subscale raw scores was converted into a development age using correspondence table. Subscale and global development quotients were computed by dividing the development age by the chronological age multiplied by 100. For preterm infants, chronological age was corrected taking into account the gestational term. Higher QD's scores show a better psychomotor development outcome","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"51.96","spread":"7.88"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"51.27","spread":"6.48"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"51.66","spread":"6.37"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"51.67","spread":"8.29"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"BL (Brunet Lezine Revised Scale)","description":"BL includes 4 subscales : Locomotor, Coordination, Language, Sociability.
