The primary hypothesis is that L50/H12.5/A5 is more effective in lowering mean trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (SiDBP) after 8 weeks of treatment compared to L50+A5 in Japanese participants with essential hypertension who are not adequately controlled following an 8-week treatment with filter period study drug (L50+A5).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Mean Trough Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (SiDBP)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"L50/H12.5/A5","deltaMin":-9.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"L50 + A5","deltaMin":-8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.205"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25271811","25716649"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":164},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis"]}}
