The investigators hypothesize that dutasteride 1 mg per day will be well tolerated in this patient population and that, compared to placebo treatment, dutasteride will result in a greater reduction in drinks per week and in the frequency of heavy drinking days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Heavy Drinking Days Per Week for Dutasteride vs. Placebo Groups","timeFrame":"12 weeks (from initiation to end of treatment phase 1)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Dutasteride","deltaMin":-2.24,"sd":0.33},{"arm":"Placebo Capsule","deltaMin":-1.41,"sd":0.28}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.012"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":75},"commonTop":["Nausea","Muscle or body ache","Dizzy or lightheaded","Difficulty sleeping","Headache"]}}
