Few treatments to prevent heart problems around the time of surgery have been tested. There is encouraging data suggesting that small doses of Acetyl-Salicylic Acid (ASA) and Clonidine, which are two medications, given individually for a short period before and after major surgeries may prevent major heart problems. The POISE-2 Trial is a large international study to test if ASA and Clonidine can prevent heart attacks and deaths from heart problems around the time of surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Composite of All-cause Mortality and Nonfatal MI","timeFrame":"30 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Clonidine and Active ASA","deltaMin":173,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Clonidine and Placebo ASA","deltaMin":194,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Clonidine and Active ASA","deltaMin":178,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Clonidine and Placebo ASA","deltaMin":161,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"45 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":23,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Colombia","Denmark","France","Germany","Hong Kong","India","Italy","Malaysia","New Zealand","Pakistan","Peru","South Africa","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24679062","24679061","24568963","39753401","36891761","35224730","30019751","29132159","25399007","24890528","23639498"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":46,"n":2499},"commonTop":[]}}
