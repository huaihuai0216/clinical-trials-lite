Participants using prandial insulin may be switched to everyday (qd) glargine if investigator judges that the participant will still meet fasting glucose requirements for randomization.\n* Are using insulin pump therapy.\n* Have excessive insulin resistance: Defined as \\>1.0 unit/kg/day as baseline treatment.\n* If being treated with sulfonylureas (SUs) before screening, then must have SUs washed out between screening and randomization.\n* Use any of these concomitant medications: morphine, codeine, antidiuretics, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (for example, exenatide, exenatide once weekly, lixisenatide or liraglutide), or pramlintide, used concurrently or within 90 days before screening.\n* Have hypoglycemia unawareness, defined as confirmed by laboratory test results or by historical episodes of hypoglycemia \\<54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) without symptoms.\n* Have fasting hypertriglyceridemia \\>400 mg/dL (\\>4.5 mmol/L) at screening, as determined by the local laboratory.\n* Have had any episode of severe hypoglycemia (defined by requiring assistance due to neurologically disabling hypoglycemia) within 6 months before entry into the study.\n* Have had 2 or more emergency room visits or hospitalizations due to poor glucose control in the past 6 months.\n* Have had a previous clinically significant episode of ketoacidosis as determined by the investigator (ketone bodies at fasting and without acidosis is acceptable) in the past 6 months.\n* Have history of renal transplantation, are currently receiving renal dialysis, or have estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) \\<60 milliliters/minute.\n* Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease (excluding nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), acute or chronic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or elevated liver enzyme measurements.\n* Have active or untreated malignancy, have been in remission from clinically significant malignancy (other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) for less than 5 years, or are at increased risk for developing cancer or a recurrence of cancer in the opinion of the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia","description":"The percentage was calculated by dividing the number of participants with clinically significant hypoglycemia events defined as blood glucose \\<54 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.0 millimole per liter \\[mmol/L\\]) or symptoms of severe hypoglycemia by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"35.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia 12 Hours Post Double Dose","description":"The percentage was calculated by dividing the number of participants with clinically significant hypoglycemia events defined as blood glucose \\<54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) or symptoms of severe hypoglycemia by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"22.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Hypoglycemia","description":"The percentage was calculated by dividing the number of participants with hypoglycemia events defined as blood glucose ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"64.5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"42.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"82.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Nadir Glucose","description":"Nadir glucose was defined as the lowest blood glucose for a participant with blood glucose ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).
