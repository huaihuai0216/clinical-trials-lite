Participants will be treated with study insulin daily, in two 4-week study periods. Each participant will receive insulin peglispro during one treatment period and insulin glargine during the other treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia","timeFrame":"Predose to 84 Hours Post Double Dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Peglispro","deltaMin":6.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Insulin Glargine","deltaMin":35.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":64},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Back pain","Ecchymosis","Abdominal pain"]}}
