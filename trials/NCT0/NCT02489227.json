Equivalence was based upon 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between the proportions of subjects in the CHS-1420 and Humira groups achieving PASI-75 at Week 12. If the 95% CI lay entirely within the interval (-15%, 15%), equivalence was established.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"203","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"211","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":274},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}}
