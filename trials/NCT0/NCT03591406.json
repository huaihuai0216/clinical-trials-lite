This includes drug allergies.\n* Planned surgery with anticipated blood loss (defined as Hb drop \\>2 g/dL) in the 3 months post randomisation\n* Subject has known malignancy (with or without current treatment), except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia\n* Haemodialysis (current or planned within the next 3 months)\n* History of IV iron therapy, erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) therapy and/or blood transfusion in previous 4 weeks prior to screening, and oral iron or oral iron-containing products including Chinese herbal medicines (\\>75mg iron/day) in the 7 days prior to screening\n* Body weight \\<35 kg\n* Chronic liver disease and/or screening alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) above 3 times the upper limit of the normal range\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus infection, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, tuberculosis\n* Known active hepatitis B or C or other active infection (acute or chronic)\n* Subject currently is enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 30 days since ending other investigational device or drug study(ies), or subject is receiving other investigational agent(s)\n* Subject is pregnant or is breast feeding\n* Female subject of childbearing potential not using adequate contraceptive methods during the study and for up to 1 month after the last dose of the study medication. Adequate contraceptive methods are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intra-uterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner. Non-childbearing potential includes being surgically sterilised at least 6 months prior to the study or post-menopausal, defined as amenorrhoea for at least 12 months\n* Male subjects planning to father a child within 7 days from the last study drug administration.\n* Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures and/or other reason(s) that render subject not appropriate for study participation in the opinion of the treating
