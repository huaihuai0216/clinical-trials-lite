The secondary objectives are to assess the safety of FCM compared to IS in the Chinese population and to evaluate the effect of FCM compared to IS on relevant laboratory parameters (haematology, chemistry, iron parameters) in the Chinese population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants Achieving an Increase in Hb of at Least 2 g/dL at Any Time up to Week 8","timeFrame":"From baseline at any time up to Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM)","deltaMin":176,"sd":null},{"arm":"Iron Sucrose (IS)","deltaMin":175,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":187},"commonTop":["Urine phosphorus decreased","Upper respiratory tract infection","Hypophosphataemia","Hepatic function abnormal","Alanine aminotransferase increased"]}}
