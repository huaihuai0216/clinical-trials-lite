Repeating of percentage predicted FEV1 should be done in an ad-hoc visit to be scheduled on a date that would provide sufficient time to receive confirmation from the spirometry data central reviewer of the validity of the assessment before Visit 99.\n* Patients must demonstrate reversibility defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and 200 mL within 15 to 30 minutes after administration of 400 µg of salbutamol at Visit 2. Spacer devices are permitted during reversibility testing only. The Investigator or delegate may decide whether or not to use a spacer for the reversibility testing.\n\n  * If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2, patients may be permitted to enter the study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed within 5 years prior to Visit 1.\n  * Alternatively, patients may be permitted to enter the study with a historical positive bronchoprovocation test (defined as a provoked fall in FEV1 of 20% by bronchoconstriction agent e.g., methacholine, histamine) or equivalent test (e.g., astography) that was performed within 5 years prior to Visit 1.\n  * If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2 and historical data is not available, reversibility should be repeated once in an ad-hoc visit scheduled as close as possible from the first attempt (but not on the same day).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6-weeks of Visit 1.\n* Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation.\n* Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study.\n* Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or bladder-neck obstruction or severe renal impairment or urinary retention. BPH patients who are stable on treatment can be considered.\n* Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99. Patients may be re-screened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening.\n* Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not limited to) COPD, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active tuberculosis.\n* Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia\n* Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women\n* Women of child-bearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 30 days after stopping of investigational medication","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","description":"An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence (example; any unfavorable and unintended sign including abnormal laboratory findings, symptom or disease) in a participant or clinical investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit.
