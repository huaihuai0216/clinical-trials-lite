The investigators will conduct a 12-week double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with L-methylfolate supplementing open-label OROS-Methylphenidate (OROS-MPH). The investigators propose to examine 40 adult (ages 18-55) subjects satisfying the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS)","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"L-Methylfolate","deltaMin":-22.9,"sd":10.4},{"arm":"Placebo (for L-Methylfolate)","deltaMin":-20.8,"sd":11.3}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["Headache","Insomnia","Cold/Infection/Allergy","Decreased Appetite","Mucosal Dryness"]}}
