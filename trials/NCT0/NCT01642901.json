Intravenous (IV) zoledronic acid (ZA) is an FDA-approved drug that has been shown to be more effective than other agents in reducing bone mass resorption and leg fractures in post-menopausal women, but has not been studied in patients with acute SCI. This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IV ZA to prevent bone loss early after SCI. Up to 48 subjects will be randomized to receive a one-time dose of 5 mg of IV ZA versus placebo within 21 days of an SCI.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Areal Bone Mineral Density at Hip","timeFrame":"4 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Zoledronic Acid 5 mg IV Infusion","deltaMin":0.92,"sd":7.14},{"arm":"Normal Saline 0.9%","deltaMin":-12,"sd":7.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32055041"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":10},"commonTop":["Fever","Flu-like symptoms","elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)"]}}
