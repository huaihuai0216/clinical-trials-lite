The purpose is to see if treatment with LCE may reverse baseline brain deficits and if this change is associated with clinical improvement. Hypothesis is that treatment with LCE, compared to placebo, increases abstinence from cocaine over a 12-week trial in combination with behavioral treatment with voucher incentives.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Cocaine Urine Toxicology","timeFrame":"collected 3x/week for 24 weeks of trial or for the duration of the participants involvement in the study.","effectByArm":[],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":9},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Insomnia","Dry Mouth","increased libido","diarrhea"]}}
