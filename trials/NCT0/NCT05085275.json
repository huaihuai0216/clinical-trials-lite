Most recent transferrin saturation (TSAT) less than or equal to 45% within 45 days of Day 1.\n4. Most recent serum phosphate is greater or equal to 3.0 mg per dL within 45 days of Day 1.\n5. Most recent ferritin is less than or equal to 500 ng per mL within 45 days of Day 1.\n6. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 28 days prior to Day 1.\n7.

Limited life expectancy (less than 6 months) in the opinion of the Investigator.\n9. Females who are known to be pregnant or are breast-feeding during Screening or are planning to become pregnant and breastfeeding during the study period.\n10. Evidence of a clinically active infection requiring antibiotics at Randomization.\n11.
