These include:\n\n  * hormonal contraceptives as prescribed by a physician (oral, hormonal vaginal ring, hormonal implant or depot injectable);\n  * medically prescribed intra-uterine device;\n  * medically prescribed topically-applied transdermal contraceptive patch;\n  * double-barrier method (eg, condom in combination with a spermicide); vasectomy and tubal ligation should each be considered as single barrier.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential should be counseled in the appropriate use of birth control while in the study. Female participants who are not currently sexually active must agree and consent to use one of the above-mentioned methods if they become sexually active while participating in the study.\n* Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Screening Visit in order to be considered eligible for enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants with a clinical history of symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or asthma, having received regular medications due to another allergen during or potentially overlapping the GPS.\n* Participants with a clinical history of significant symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma having received regular medication due to an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed.\n* Participants with sufficient pre-seasonal data in the observational phase will not be eligible to continue in the treatment phase if the subject: 1) does not experience an increase in rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score of equal to or greater than 4 above the pre-seasonal average symptom score for at least 2 days, 2) does not use allergy rescue medication for at least 2 days, during the observational phase Year 1 2008 GPS.\n* Participants that received an immunosuppressive treatment within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit (except steroids for allergic and asthma symptoms).\n* Participants with a clinical history of severe asthma.\n* Participants with history of anaphylaxis with cardiorespiratory symptoms.\n* Participants with a history of self-injectable epinephrine use.\n* Participants with a history of chronic urticaria and angioedema.\n* Participants with clinical history of chronic sinusitis during the 2 years prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Participants with current severe atopic dermatitis.\n* Female participants who are breast-feeding, pregnant, or intending to become pregnant.\n* Participatns who have had previous treatment by immunotherapy with grass pollen allergen or any other allergen within the 5 years prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Participants with a known history of allergy, hypersensitivity or intolerance to the ingredients of the investigational medicinal products (except for Phleum pratense), rescue medications, or self-injectable epinephrine.\n* Participants with any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study evaluations or optimal participation in the study. Specific examples include but are not limited to hypertension being treated with beta blockers, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, stroke, ocular conditions requiring topical beta blockers, any condition requiring the use of beta blockers.\n* Participants that have used any investigational drugs within 30 days of the Screening Visit.\n* Participants that are participating in any other clinical study.\n* Participants that are a family member of the investigational study staff conducting this study.\n* Participants that are unable to meet medication washout requirements as listed in the protocol.\n* Participants that are unlikely to be able to complete the trial, for any reason, or likely to travel for extended periods of time during the GPS, which in the opinion of the investigator will compromise the data.\n* Participants with a clinically significant abnormal vital sign or laboratory value that would preclude participation in the study.\n* Participants participating in this study may not participate in this same study at another investigational site.\n* Participants must not be randomized into this study more than once.\n* Participants who are unable to or will not comply with the use of self-injectable epinephrine.\n* Participants that may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Participant Total Combined Symptom (TCS) Score Over the Entire Grass Pollen Season (GPS)","description":"The TCS is the sum of the rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom score (DSS) and rhinoconjunctivitis daily medication score (DMS) averaged over the entire GPS.
