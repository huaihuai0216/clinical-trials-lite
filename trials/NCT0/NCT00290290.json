Therefore, it is conceivable that application of an optimal antiseptic agent can reduce the rate of surgical wound infections. This trial is to compare the impact of disinfecting the skin with Chloraprep (2%chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol) vs. Betadine on the rates of infection of clean-contaminated surgical wounds. The study will also assess the occurrence of adverse effects on the skin from either antiseptic agent and the cost-savings associated with the use of Chloraprep vs Betadine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Primary Objective of This Trial is to Compare the Impact of Disinfecting the Skin With Chloraprep vs. Betadine on the Rates of Infection of Clean-contaminated Surgical Wounds.","timeFrame":"during surgery and within the 30 days post surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Povidone-Iodine","deltaMin":16.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chlorhexidine-Alcohol","deltaMin":9.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.004"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":6,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20054046"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":440},"commonTop":["Pruritis/Erythema"]}}
