The CAPS-IV is a structured clinical interview designed to assess the 17 DSM-IV PTSD symptoms. CAPS-IV provides categorical ratings of diagnostic status as well as a quantitative index of symptom severity. The CAPS total severity score is based on response to the 17 items that assess the frequency and intensity of current PTSD symptoms. Symptom severity is assessed separately for past month and past week time frames.\n\nCAPS-IV range is 0-136, higher scores mean a worse outcome.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.42","spread":"26.55"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"50.61","spread":"25.22"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"54.20","spread":"26.72"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"48.59","spread":"24.71"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":97},"commonTop":[]}}}
