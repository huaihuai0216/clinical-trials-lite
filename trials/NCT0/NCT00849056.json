Based on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA): change = treatment + BL HbA1c + prior myocardial infarction history + age category + region + current antidiabetic therapy. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing post-BL HbA1c values; the last non-missing post-BL on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. HbA1c values obtained after hyperglycemic rescue were treated as missing and were replaced with pre-rescue values. One Intent-to-Treat (ITT) participant (par.) had all post-BL HbA1c measurements occur after hyperglycemic rescue. This par. is included in the ITT Population counts but did not contribute to this analysis.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.05","spread":"0.071"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.81","spread":"0.071"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Hyperglycemia Rescue","description":"Participants who experienced persistent hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) could have qualified for hyperglycemia rescue.

Time to hyperglycemia rescue is defined as the time between the date of the first dose of study medication and the date of hyperglycemia rescue plus 1 day, or the time between the date of the first dose of study medication and the date of the last visit during the active treatment period plus 1 day for participants not requiring rescue. This time was divided by 7 to express the result in weeks.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.86","spread":"0.674"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":"0.812"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 52","description":"The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours.
