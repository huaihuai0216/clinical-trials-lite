Since there was the possibility of a subject becoming totally disabled our FDA peer reviewed design called for its use as follows: If the subject completed both periods, the score was calculated as the difference in scores between the end of Period 2 (at 12 months) minus that at the end of Period 1 (6 months). If a subject became totally disabled, this difference was considered as plus infinity if it occurred in period 1 (Penalizes period 1), and minus infinity if it occurred in Period 2 (Penalizes period 2). The two treatments were compared via the Wilcoxon test, and the effect size was estimated using Kendall's Tau-B. This is interpreted in a similar manner to correlation with positive values favoring COQenzyme10 and negative values favoring placebo.

Second, if the subject became totally disabled during period 1, the difference was defined as + infinity, (highest possible evidence favoring period 2), and if the subject became totally disabled in period 2, the subject was scored as - infinity (highest possible evidence favoring period 1). Period 2 minus period 1 differences were ranked form low to high with missing values scores at the mid-rank. The Hotelling T-square was computed on these ranks and the P-value was obtained from 100,000 rerandomizations as the fraction of rerandomizations with T-sq at least as large as that observed.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":19},"commonTop":["GI Issues","Elevated Liver Enzymes","Ear Infection","Neuromusclar Changes","Decreased White Blood Count"]}}}
