The participant is asked to recall all twelve words after a 30 minute delay. Only the words that were missed on the preceding trial were given in the consecutive trial. The total score represented a sum score of total 6 trials, therefore the score range was from 0 to 72. The lower the score the worse the outcome, higher score indicated better recall.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.5","spread":"4.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.0","spread":"1.4"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.5","spread":"2.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"DB: Pharmacokinetics: Steady-state Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Teriflunomide","description":"Ctrough was defined as the concentration reached by the drug before the next dose administered.
