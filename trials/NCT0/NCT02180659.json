Subject must provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study-related procedures.\n2. Male or female, 18-65 years of age, inclusive.\n3.

Current diagnosis of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).\n2.

Significant symptoms or other factors which in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude compliance with the protocol, subject safety, adequate cooperation in the study, or obtaining informed consent.\n10. Current medical conditions such as severe respiratory insufficiency that may prevent the subject from safely participating in study.\n11. Any pending legal action that could prohibit participation or compliance in the study.\n12. Exposure to any investigational drug within the 8 weeks prior to Screening.\n13. Aspartate aminotransferase levels ≥3 X the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase levels ≥ 3 X the upper limit of normal, total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 X the upper limit of normal, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 X upper limit of normal on the Screening laboratory assessments.\n14.
