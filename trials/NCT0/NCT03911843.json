All received vitamin D 1000 IU /day since disease's onset. Moreover in the 2017 group omega-3 were supplemented, starting within 3 and 6 months from the disease's outbreak, and those were considered cases; the other 38 were enrolled as controls. Four cases and one control dropped out. Finally in 59/64 were compared data of glycosylated hemoglobin percentage (HbA1c%), average insulin daily requirement (IU/Kg/day), and IDAA1c \\[Insulin Daily dose Adjusted for HbA1c, a surrogate index of residual endogen insulin secretion, calculated as insulin daily dose (IU/Kg/24 h) x 4 + HbA1c%\\] at recruitment (T0), and 3 (T3), 6 (T6), 12 (T12) months after. T0 in cases was at the start of supplementation of omega-3, and consequently 3, 6 and 12 months after; in controls were found data in clinical records of outpatient beginning from the 3rd month and 3-6-12 months thereafter. Then 22 cases and 37 controls were compared.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Daily Insulin Need (IU/Kg/Day) and Daily Insulin Pre-meal Demand (Pre-meal IU/Kg/Day) at 12 Months","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CASES New T1D Onsets 2017","deltaMin":0.49,"sd":0.2},{"arm":"CONTROLS Previous T1D Onsets","deltaMin":0.63,"sd":0.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["29424911","27467009"],"seeAlso":["http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03406897"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":22},"commonTop":["persistent diarrhea","transient suppression of TRH","an extension of the aPTT clotting"]}}
