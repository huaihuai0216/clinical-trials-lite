Laboratory tests show that this drug works by helping improve the body's immune response to help fight cancer. Pembrolizumab may help the immune system to recognize cancer cells and slow down the growth and/or spreading of cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Phase II: Progression Free Survival Measured as Time From Randomization to First Observation of Objective Disease Relapse or Progression","timeFrame":"PFS was monitored continuously, with assessments every 6 weeks for 3 visits, then every 12 weeks, 4 weeks post-discontinuation, every 12 weeks until progression, and every 24 weeks until death, over an average of 16.2 months.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A - Cisplatin/Pemetrexed","deltaMin":6.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B - Cisplatin/Pemetrexed/Pembrolizumab","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm C - Pembrolizumab (Phase II Only)","deltaMin":5.26,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":18,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":57,"countries":["Canada","France","Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37931632","33358660"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":21},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Dyspnea","Nausea","Constipation","Cough"]}}
