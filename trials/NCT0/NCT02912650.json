Subjects will be healthy males and females aged 18-40 years, inclusive, who are experiencing post-operative pain following surgical extraction of 3 or more third molar teeth. Following extraction, subjects must experience, within 5 hours, post-surgical pain of at least moderate severity (on a 4-point categorical scale), confirmed by a Visual Analog Pain Severity Rating Scale (VAS PSR) of at least 50 mm on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of study medication under double-blind conditions and then evaluated on site for 12 hours following administration of study medication. Subjects will provide self-ratings of pain severity and pain relief at various time points using categorical and numerical scales. Additionally, subjects will also evaluate the time to first perceptible relief and time to meaningful relief using a double stopwatch method. Finally, at 12 hours, subjects will complete a categorical Global Evaluation of the study medication. A review of any reported adverse events will also be completed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Scores on 11-Point Numerical Scale From 0 to 8 Hours Post-dose (SPID11 [0-8])","timeFrame":"0 to 8 hours post-dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":4.1,"sd":19},{"arm":"Ibuprofen 250 mg + Acetaminophen 500 mg","deltaMin":34.3,"sd":19.6},{"arm":"Ibuprofen 250 mg","deltaMin":28.9,"sd":20.5},{"arm":"Acetaminophen 650 mg","deltaMin":19.4,"sd":20}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.008"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=B5061003&StudyName=A%20Phase%203%2C%20Double-blind%2C%20Randomized%2C%20Safety%20And%20Efficacy%20Study%20Comparing%20A%20Single%20Oral%20Dose%20Of%20Ibuprofen%20%28ibu%29%20250%20Mg%2Facetaminophen%20%28apap%29%20500%20Mg%20%28administered%20As%20Two%20Tablets%20Of%20Ibu%2Fapap%20125%20Mg%2F250%20Mg%29%20To%20Each%20Active%20Drug%20Monocomponent%20Alone%20And%20To%20Placebo%20In%20The%20Treatment%20Of%20Post-surgical%20Dental%20Pain"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":56},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Dizziness","Headache","Flushing"]}}
