Patients will be randomized - subgroup 1 will undergo a 60minute non-diagnostic transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring during CEA or CS, subgroup 2 will undergo interventions without TCD monitoring. The second aim is to compare number of brain infarctions detected using MRI between CEA and CS patients.\n\nConfirmation of the investigators hypothesis that sonothrombolysis is able to activate endogenous fibrinolytic system during CEA or CS with consecutive reduction of the number and volume of brain infarcts, can lead to the increase of the safety of CEA and CS in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. The investigators can presume that up to 50% of patients indicated for CEA or CS can be treated using these methods in the future.\n\nIn the Substudy \"Risk of brain infarction after carotid endarterectomy and stenting\" the the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic brain infarctions, changes in cognitive functions, as well as morbidity and mortality at 30 days between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses undergoing elective CEA and CAS will be compared.\n\nThe sample size of the Substudy was based on an expected 80% difference of new ischemic lesions on DWI-MRI between CEA (estimated prevalence, 30%) and CAS (54%). Pre-study calculations showed that a minimum of 73 patients in each group was needed to reach a significant difference with an alpha value of 0.05 (two-tailed) and a beta value of 0.8 assuming that 15% of subjects would be lost to follow-up or refuse to participate in the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With a New Brain Infarction Detected Using Magnetic Resonance","timeFrame":"24 hours after intervention","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Carotid Endarterectomy With Sonolysis","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Carotid Endarterectomy Without Sonolysis","deltaMin":15,"sd":null},{"arm":"Carotid Stenting With Sonolysis","deltaMin":33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Carotid Stenting Without Sonolysis","deltaMin":42,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Czechia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26417059","25511816"],"seeAlso":["http://fno.cz","http://mzcr.cz"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":53},"commonTop":[]}}
