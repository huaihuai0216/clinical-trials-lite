The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine when administered to preadolescent and adolescent boys and girls 9 to 15 years of age and young women 16 to 26 years of age is generally well-tolerated.\n2. 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induces non-inferior immune responses in preadolescent and adolescent girls 9 to 15 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type compared to young women 16 to 26 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative Day 1 through Month 7 to the relevant HPV type, as measured by anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 geometric mean titers (GMTs) at 4 weeks post-dose 3.\n3. The 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induces non-inferior immune responses in preadolescent and adolescent boys 9 to 15 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type compared to young women 16 to 26 years of age who are seronegative at Day 1 and PCR-negative Day 1 through Month 7 to the relevant HPV type, as measured by anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 GMTs at 4 weeks post-dose 3.\n4. Three separate final manufacturing process (FMP) lots of the 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine induce similar immune responses, as measured by anti-HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 GMTs at 4 weeks post-dose 3.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Base Study: Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) for Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine (9- to 15-Year-Old Females [Lot 1] and 16- to 26-Year-Old Females [Lot 1])","timeFrame":"4 weeks post-vaccination 3 (Month 7)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Base Study: 9- to 15-Year-Old Females (Lot 1)","deltaMin":1715.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Base Study: 9- to 15-Year-Old Males (Lot 1)","deltaMin":900.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"9 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["26086587","26101366","27422279","32659510","37667847","29767739","29269325"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":643},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema","Headache","Pyrexia"]}}
