A Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children (K-SADS)16 was administered on all subjects to assist in diagnostic process.\n* A clinician-administered Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score of 3 or greater. An Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) score at screening or baseline greater than or equal to the 90th percentile normative values for gender and age in at least one of the following categories: the hyperactive-impulsive subscale, inattentive subscale or the total score.\n* Subject must have been in need of pharmacological treatment for ADHD.\n* Subjects taking a medication to control ADHD at the time of screening must have been experiencing suboptimal efficacy, a safety or tolerability issue or in need of a long-acting liquid formulation.\n* For subjects taking any daily medication at screening aside from ADHD medication: parent or legal guardian agreed that there would be no elective changes in subject's medications during the study (10 weeks total).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Excluded comorbid psychiatric diagnoses: DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis (active) other than ADHD, with the exception of Specific Phobias, Learning Disorders, Motor Skills Disorders, Communication Disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Elimination Disorders, Sleep Disorders, and Adjustment Disorders.\n* Clinically significant cognitive impairment as assessed in the clinical judgment of the Investigator. In cases where this was not clear, study staff were permitted to administer a Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)17 to estimate the intelligence quotient (IQ). Significant cognitive impairment for this protocol was defined as an estimated IQ below 80.\n* Subjects with chronic medical illnesses including seizure disorder (excluding a history of febrile seizures), severe hypertension, thyroid disease, structural cardiac disorders, serious cardiac conditions, serious arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, glaucoma, Tourette's Disorder, family history of Tourette's Disorder or tics.\n* Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 30 days of the screening visit.\n* Use of any psychotropic medication (except sedative hypnotics prescribed as a sleep aid at a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to screening, at bedtime only). Use of stimulant medication for control of ADHD at screening was permitted if inclusion criterion number 6 was met.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Years","maximumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Swanson, Kotin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP)-Combined Scores at Hour 4 Post-Dose","description":"The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using an independent observer rating of the participant's impairment in classroom observed behaviors.
