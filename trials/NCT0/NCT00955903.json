The investigators will test the hypothesis that changes in diet composition alone or in conjunction with weight loss will have a significant effect on fat stores, and as a result, improve cardiometabolic risk factors and functional status in adults 65 and older.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Abdominal Fat Mass","timeFrame":"Baseline to 1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Weight Loss","deltaMin":-192.6,"sd":185.2},{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":-21.9,"sd":173.7},{"arm":"Weight Maintenance","deltaMin":-275,"sd":189.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35654771","35471192","34486528","31145045"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":55},"commonTop":["Muscle and bone issues","Cardiovascular","Gastrointestinal","Nervous system","General, Constitutional"]}}
