Subject is non-pregnant and non-lactating\n6. Subject is in good general health and free of any known disease state or physical condition which, in the investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of any Target Lesion or which exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation\n7. Subject is willing and able to follow all study instructions and to attend all study visits\n8. Subject is able to comprehend and willing to sign an Informed Consent Form.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject has clinically atypical and - or rapidly growing seborrheic keratosis lesions\n2. Subject has presence of multiple eruptive seborrheic keratosis lesions (Sign of Lesser -Trelat)\n3. Subject has a current systemic malignancy\n4. Subject has used any of the following systemic therapies within the specified period prior to enrollment:\n\n   * Retinoids; 180 days\n   * Glucocortico-steroids;\n   * Anti-metabolites (e.g., methotrexate);\n5. Subject has used any of the following topical therapies within the specified period or in a proximity to any Target Lesion, that in the investigator's opinion interferes with the study medication treatment or the study assessments:\n\n   * LASER, light or other energy based therapy (e.g., intense pulsed light, photo-dynamic therapy;\n   * Liquid nitrogen, electrodesiccation, curettage, imiquimod, 5-flurouracil, or ingenol mebutate;\n   * Retinoids;\n   * Microdermabrasion or superficial chemical peels;\n   * Glucocortico-steroids or antibiotics\n6. Subject currently has or has had any of the following within the specified period or in a proximity to any Target Lesion that, in the investigator's opinion, interferes with the study medication treatment or the study assessments:\n\n   * A cutaneous malignancy;\n   * A sunburn; currently\n   * A pre-malignancy (e.g., actinic keratosis); currently\n   * Body art (e.g., tattoos, piercing, etc.); currently\n   * Excessive tan; currently\n7.

Subject has any current skin disease (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, sun damage, etc.), or condition (e.g., sunburn, excessive hair, open wounds) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might put the subject at undue risk by study participation or interfere with the study conduct or evaluations\n9.
