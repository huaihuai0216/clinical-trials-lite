Previous studies have shown that oxybutynin is effective in managing hot flashes, however doses used in prior studies have resulted in side effects. This trial is evaluating lower doses of oxybutynin with the goal of determining if they are efficacious with less side effects.\n\nADAM-VTE","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Change in Hot Flash Activity Score From Baseline to Week 7 for Low Dose Oxybutynin vs Placebo and for High Dose Oxybutynin vs Placebo","timeFrame":"Baseline up to day 49","effectByArm":[{"arm":"High-dose Oxybutynin Chloride Group","deltaMin":-16.9,"sd":15.6},{"arm":"Low-dose Oxybutynin Chloride Group","deltaMin":-10.6,"sd":7.7},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":-5.7,"sd":10.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0041"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":46},"commonTop":["Dry mouth","Diarrhea","Blurred vision","Dizziness","Headache"]}}
