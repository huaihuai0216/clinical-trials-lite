There will be a series of 12 peptide vaccinations given as a subcutaneous (beneath the skin) injection (vaccines) at 2 week intervals resulting in an immune response to myeloma. The tumor peptides used in the vaccines are unique to myeloma, and it is not expected that there will be an immune response to normal organs. Myeloma cells must express MAGE-A3 or NY-ESO-1, be severe enough to require chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation and have appropriate HLA tissue type.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":4},"commonTop":[]}}}
