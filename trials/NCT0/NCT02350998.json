Eligible subjects will receive a single dose to each ear of 6 mg OTO-201, administered intraoperatively into the middle ear through the lumen of the tympanostomy tube (trans-tympanostomy tube TTT). The study is designed to characterize safety and any procedural issues associated with TTT drug administration of OTO-201.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Otoscopic Examination: Auricle and Meatus","timeFrame":"Up to 1 month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"6mg OTO-201","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":33},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Ear Pain","Pyrexia","Upper Respiratory Infection","Nasal Congestion"]}}
