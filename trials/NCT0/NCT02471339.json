People usually take medicines for the pain, but they may not work well and might cause side effects. A new strategy called Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) may help these people cope with chronic pain. ACT focuses on things like values and living in the moment.\n\nObjective:\n\n\\- To see if Acceptance and Commitment Training improves pain coping in people with NF1 pain.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- People age 16-34 who have NF1, 1 or more PN tumors, and pain that interferes with their daily functioning.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and questions about their pain.\n* Participants will fill out questionnaires about their pain and feelings. Their heart rate will be measured via electrocardiogram (ECG).\n* Participants will be divided into 2 groups randomly. One will wait 8 weeks.\n* The other will start training right away.\n* Participants will have 2 two-hour sessions with an ACT trainer. They will learn techniques for setting goals based on personal values and other ways to cope with pain. They will get a workbook and a compact disc (CD) to take home for practice.\n* Participants will do practice exercises at home between sessions. They will get weekly emails with a practice exercise. They will join video chat sessions via home computer with their trainer.\n* All participants will return to National Institutes of Health (NIH) after 8 weeks for questionnaires and an ECG. The wait group will then start training. They will return 8 weeks later for questionnaires and an ECG.\n* Six months later, they will complete questionnaires from home by computer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Pain Interference Mean Score Change From Baseline to 8 Weeks Between the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention Group and the Waitlist Group","timeFrame":"Baseline and 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"1/Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Group","deltaMin":61.93,"sd":5.9},{"arm":"2/Waitlist (WL) Group","deltaMin":62.87,"sd":5.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://clinicalstudies.info.nih.gov/cgi/detail.cgi?B_2015-C-0142.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":32},"commonTop":[]}}
