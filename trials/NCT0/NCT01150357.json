The low dose ranges from 6.25 mg to 25 mg of aliskiren, the mid dose ranges from 37.5 mg to 150 mg of aliskiren and the high dose ranges from 150 mg to 600 mg of aliskiren. This study is being conducted to support monotherapy registration of aliskiren for the treatment of hypertension in children 6-17 years of age.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) at Endpoint (Phase 1)","timeFrame":"Baseline to endpoint (Week 4 or Last observation carried forward (LOCF))","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Phase 1: Aliskiren Low (6.25/12.5/25 mg)","deltaMin":-5.54,"sd":0.78},{"arm":"Phase 1: Aliskiren Mid (37.5/75/150 mg)","deltaMin":-5.42,"sd":1.331},{"arm":"Phase 1: Aliskiren High (150/300/600 mg)","deltaMin":-9.03,"sd":1.008}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Germany","Guatemala","Hungary","Poland","Puerto Rico","Slovakia","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":108},"commonTop":["Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection","Oropharyngeal pain","Diarrhoea","Acute tonsillitis"]}}
