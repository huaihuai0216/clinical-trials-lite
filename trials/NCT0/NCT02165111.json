Each patient will undergo injection with a treatment dose of Botulinum toxin A in one randomly-selected hand, and the contralateral hand will be injected with sterile saline (placebo) to serve as a control.\n\nStudy participants at the first study visit will complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive laser Doppler imaging to assess blood flow. After this initial assessment, the patients will undergo peri-arterial injection of Botulinum toxin A in one hand, and of sterile saline solution (placebo) in the other, in a randomized, blinded manner.\n\nPatient will report the severity of their Raynaud's symptoms weekly over the four month study period. At one month post-injection, the patient will complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive laser Doppler imaging. At four months post-injection, the patient will again complete study questionnaires, their hands will be assessed clinically for digital ulceration, and their hands will undergo non-invasive laser Doppler imaging. In addition, patient will be given the option of one week post-injection visit, at which point the same assessment will be performed.\n\nAt the conclusion of the study, unblinding will occur.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Digital Blood Flow From Pre- to Post-injection.","timeFrame":"Measured pre-injection and at one month post-injection.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Onabotulinumtoxin A","deltaMin":-36.19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-6.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21868066","28426903"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Intrinsic muscle weakness"]}}
