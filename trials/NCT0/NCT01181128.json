The secondary objectives of this study are: to characterize the PK profile of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, Advate®; to characterize the range of dose and schedules required to adequately prevent bleeding in a prophylaxis regimen, maintain hemostasis in a surgical setting, or to treat bleeding episodes in an on-demand, weekly treatment, or prophylaxis setting.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Incidence Rate of FVIII Inhibitor Development","timeFrame":"up to 52 weeks ± 2 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Individualized (Tailored) Prophylaxis","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Weekly Prophylaxis","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 3: Episodic (On-Demand) Dosing","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"All Arms: Total","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":64,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Hong Kong","India","Israel","Italy","Japan","New Zealand","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24227821","25196897","39091324","33719084"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":117},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Arthralgia","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
