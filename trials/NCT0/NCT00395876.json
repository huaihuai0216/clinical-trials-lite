tenecteplase catheter clearance trial\n* Use of any investigational drug or therapy within 28 days prior to treatment\n* Use of a fibrinolytic agent (e.g., alteplase, tenecteplase, reteplase, or urokinase) within 24 hours prior to treatment\n* Known to be pregnant or breastfeeding at screening\n* CVC with known or suspected infection\n* History of any intracranial hemorrhage, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation\n* Use of heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) within 24 hours prior to treatment, except for use of intermittent or low-dose, continuous infusion of heparin to maintain catheter or vessel patency\n* Use of warfarin within 7 days prior to treatment, except for low-dose warfarin used for prophylaxis\n* Initiation of or increase in dose of Plavix® (clopidogrel
