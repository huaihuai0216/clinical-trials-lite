They are found at a high level in the cell wall of fungi, yeast, oat, barley, bacteria, as well as various mushroom. Studies have reported that extract of mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) can prevent the bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency. Furthermore, polycan (a purified Î²-glucan from Aureobasidium pullulans) has been reported to exhibit osteoporosis preventing effects. However, no investigation has been conducted on the effect of polycan on bone health in perimenopausal women.\n\nTherefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of polycan on biochemical markers of bone metabolism in Korean perimenopausal women.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes in DPD(Deoxypyridinoline)","timeFrame":"12weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Polycan","deltaMin":7.1,"sd":2.2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":6.4,"sd":1.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":30},"commonTop":[]}}
