Despite the fact that specific bacteria cause tooth decay, no FDA-approved anti-microbial treatment for decay is available to the American dental professional. The Prevention of Adult Caries Study (PACS) is a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of a topical, temporary, 10% w/v chlorhexidine dental coating in reducing new decay in adult dental patients at risk for decay.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Net D12FS Caries Increment (Total of Non-cavitated Lesions (D1), Cavitated Lesions (D2) and Sound Surfaces (S))","timeFrame":"(V1) to the 13 month follow-up visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2.43,"sd":0.32},{"arm":"Active","deltaMin":2.68,"sd":0.32}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.56"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22156917","23834229","22320292","20923557"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":31,"n":493},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Sensitivity of teeth","Pharmaceutical product complaint"]}}
