D2 and D3 were treated equivalently for analysis.\n\nThis measure is computed as the sum of weighted counts of transitions in tooth surface status (root and coronal surfaces combined) from randomization to the 13-month follow-up visit. Disease progression had a positive weight (e.g., S-to-D1 (sound to non-cavitated lesion) or D1-to-D2 (non-cavitated to cavitated lesion) = 1, S-to-D2 (sound to cavitated lesion)= 2). Reversal had a negative weight (e.g., D1-to-S = -1). No change, transitions to or from missing or unscorable, and impossible transitions had 0 weight. Incident fillings and crowns were treated the same as incident D2 lesions for purposes of scoring. More details of the transition weights may be found at Vollmer WM et al. (2010).
