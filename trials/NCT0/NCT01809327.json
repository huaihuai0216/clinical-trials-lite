secondary to pancreatitis or pancreatectomy\n* Fasting C-peptide less than 0.70 ng/mL (0.23 nmol/L) in participants for whom the investigator cannot reasonably exclude T1DM based upon clinical evaluation\n* Repeated (2 or more over a 1 week period) fasting self-monitored blood glucose measurements more than 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) prior to randomization, despite reinforcement of diet and exercise counseling\n* History of hereditary glucose-galactose malabsorption or primary renal glucosuria\n* Has history of, or currently active, illness considered to be clinically significant by the
