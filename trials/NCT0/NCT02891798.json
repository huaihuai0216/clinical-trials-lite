This project will use improved local anesthetic nerve block techniques to enhance technical capability and clinical practice by (i) reducing pain and other morbidities during recovery, (ii) improving weight-bearing achievement during in-hospital physical therapy to allow for earlier return home, and (iii) continued rehabilitation as an outpatient at home when feasible (versus in an extended care facility).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (Version 2) Total Score Difference From Baseline","timeFrame":"Baseline, Post-Operative day after surgery (7AM-9AM EST)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Bupivacaine + BCD (Buprenorphine, Clonidine, Dexamethasone)","deltaMin":-1.85,"sd":2.04},{"arm":"Bupivacaine Only (Control Arm)","deltaMin":-0.05,"sd":2.38}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37256753","34730810"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":62},"commonTop":["Foot drop"]}}
