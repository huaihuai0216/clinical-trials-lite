Have been diagnosed with clinically significant neuropathy with its origins in either diabetes or other causes; have neuromuscular disease that would influence data collection.\n6. Have a surgically-fused lumbar spine, or a spinal cord simulator, or other condition that would contraindicate or prohibit the conduct of spinal anesthesia.\n7. At significant risk for postoperative substance abuse, or immediate-postoperative substance abuse withdrawal symptoms (alcohol, cocaine, enrolled in methadone or buprenorphine opioid withdrawal programs, etc.) Previous or current use of marijuana will not be an exclusion for study enrollment.\n8.
