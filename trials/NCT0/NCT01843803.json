A score between 0-7 is assigned based audio-recording. A higher score is expected for a more complex decision (decisions are categorized as basic, intermediate or complex). For basic decisions (e.g. refilling a medication) a score of 2-3 would indicate a good IDM event, an intermediate decision (e.g., prescribing use of new equipment) should result in a score of 5-6; and a complex decision (e.g. lifestyle counseling) would receive a score of 7 if all the elements of the IDM were noted. We will look at the distribution of the decisions by group to determine whether the decision complexity differs by whether or not patients complete the inventory. Also, we will look at the average IDM score by decision complexity and study group.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"41","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"47","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":136},"commonTop":[]}}}
