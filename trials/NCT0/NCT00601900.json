if medical ovarian suppression is being administered it can be initiated any time prior to or at the start of protocol therapy, and continued throughout the duration of the trial; surgical castration with bilateral oophorectomy must be performed at least 28 days prior to study registration (due to concerns of poor wound healing on bevacizumab)\n* Patients may not have received any prior anti-VEGF or VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy\n* Prior radiotherapy must have been completed and all toxicities resolved at least two weeks prior to registration\n* Chemotherapy in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is permitted;
