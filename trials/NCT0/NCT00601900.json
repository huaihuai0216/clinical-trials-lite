Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen citrate or letrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving hormone therapy is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating advanced breast cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival","timeFrame":"From randomization until disease progression or death whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Endocrine Therapy With Monoclonal Antibody)","deltaMin":20.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Endocrine Therapy)","deltaMin":15.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":37,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":522,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34616010","31276981","29789969","27138575"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":56,"n":195},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Hypertension","Headache","Proteinuria","Fever"]}}
