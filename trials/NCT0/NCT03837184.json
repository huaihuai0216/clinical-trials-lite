The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi by assessing the proportion of symptomatic SMA Type 1 participants who achieve the ability to sit unaided for at least 10 seconds up to and including the 18 months of age trial visit. At least 6 participants aged \\< 6 months (\\< 180 days) at the time of gene replacement therapy (Day 1) will be enrolled.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Who Achieved Sitting Alone for at Least 10 Seconds","timeFrame":"From Baseline up to 18 Months of Age Visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AVXS-101","deltaMin":1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"0 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Japan","South Korea","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34383289"],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/trialresult/trialresults/pdf?trialResultId=17903"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":2},"commonTop":["Dysphagia","Failure to thrive","Respiratory distress","Pharyngitis","Rhonchi"]}}
