Participants are expected to require hospitalization through completion of intravenous (IV) study intervention, and have at least one of the following primary infection types: hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP); complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI); or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI). Participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IMI/REL or active control. This study will also evaluate the efficacy of IMI/REL by assessing all-cause mortality at Day 28 post-randomization, as well as clinical and microbiological response to treatment. It will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics of IMI/REL.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With One or More Adverse Event (AE)","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IMI/REL Age Cohort 1: Adolescents (12 to <18 Years)","deltaMin":60,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Control Cohort 1: Adolescents: (12 to <18 Years)","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"IMI/REL Age Cohort 2: Older Children (6 to <12 Years)","deltaMin":64.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Control Age Cohort 2: Older Children (6 to <12 Years)","deltaMin":36.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"IMI/REL Age Cohort 3: Younger Children (2 to <6 Years)","deltaMin":71.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Control Age Cohort 3: Younger Children (2 to <6 Years)","deltaMin":62.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"IMI/REL Age Cohort 4: Infants and Toddlers (3 Months to <2 Years)","deltaMin":93.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Control Age Cohort 4: Infants and Toddlers (3 Months to <2 Years)","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"IMI/REL Age Cohort 5: Neonates and Young Infants (Birth to <3 Months)","deltaMin":25,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Control Age Cohort 5: Neonates and Young Infants (Birth to <3 Months)","deltaMin":66.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":67,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Chile","Colombia","Estonia","France","Greece","Hungary","Israel","Mexico","Norway","Philippines","Poland","Russia","South Africa","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Diarrhoea","Nausea","Pyrexia","Abdominal pain"]}}
