The safety between the two treatment arms will also be compared. During study treatment, pre- and perimenopausal women must be receiving therapy with the LHRH agonist goserelin (Zoladex® or generic).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator","timeFrame":"From randomization date to date of first documentation of progression or death (assessed up to 12 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Palbociclib + Fulvestrant","deltaMin":9.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Fulvestrant","deltaMin":3.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.000001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":247,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","Germany","Ireland","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","Portugal","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38861871","36463643","35974168","34037282","33955129","33486783","32783178","32164785","31127500","30807234","30392115","30345905","30308388","30053671","30032196","29522361","29342248","28652278","27368881","27269946","27029704","26947331","26030518"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A5481023&StudyName=Palbociclib%20%28PD-0332991%29%20Combined%20With%20Fulvestrant%20In%20Hormone%20Receptor+%20HER2-Negative%20Metastatic%20Breast%20Cancer%20After%20Endocrine%20Failure%20%28PA"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":78,"n":345},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Fatigue","Nausea","Headache","Arthralgia"]}}
