However, participants on metformin at a dose \\<1500 mg/day at the time of enrollment (stable dose for at least 12 weeks before enrollment) may be eligible for screening if documentation of lack of tolerance of a metformin dose ≥1500 mg/day can be provided.\n* Signed written informed consent.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Age \\<18 years at Screening or \\< legal age of majority, whichever is greater.\n* Type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n* Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤20 or \\>45 kilograms per meter square (kg/m\\^2) at Screening\n* Hemoglobin A1c \\<7% or \\>10% via central laboratory test at screening.\n* Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) \\>15 millimole per liter (mmol/L) (270 milligrams per deciliter \\[mg/dL\\]) measured by the central laboratory at screening (Visit 1) and confirmed by a repeat test (\\>15 mmol/L \\[270 mg/dL\\]) before randomization.\n* Women of childbearing potential not willing to use highly effective method(s) of birth control or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy during the study.\n* Treated with an antidiabetic pharmacological regimen other than metformin ≥1500 mg per day (or maximum tolerated dose) within the 12 weeks preceding the Screening Visit.\n* Previous use of any types of insulin for \\>1 month (at any time, aside from pregnancy for treatment of gestational diabetes).\n* History of prior gastric surgical procedure, including gastric banding, within 3 years before the Screening Visit.\n* History of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma within 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Mean of 3 separate blood pressure measurements \\>180 mmHg (SBP) or \\>100 mmHg (diastolic blood pressure \\[DBP\\]).\n* History of hypertensive urgency or emergency within 12 weeks prior to Screening.\n* Participants with severe anemia, severe cardiovascular (including congestive heart failure New York Heart Association \\[NYHA\\] IV), respiratory, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric, or active malignant tumor or other major systemic disease or participants with short life expectancy making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study results difficult.\n* Aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase: \\>3 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range.\n* Total bilirubin: \\>1.5 times the upper limit of the normal laboratory range (except in case of Gilbert's syndrome).\n* Use of systemic glucocorticoids (excluding topical or ophthalmic application or inhaled forms) for more than 10 consecutive days within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit.\n* Participants who has taken other investigational drugs or prohibited therapy for this study within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives from screening or randomization, whichever is longer.\n* Pregnant (confirmed by serum pregnancy test at Screening) or breastfeeding women.\n* Participants is unwilling or unable to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), complete the participants diary, or comply with study visits and other study procedures as required per protocol.\n* Contraindication to metformin as per local labelling.\n\nThe above information is not intended to contain all
