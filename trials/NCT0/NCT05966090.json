Participants with medically controlled chronic neurological diseases can be enrolled in the study as per investigator assessment, provided that their condition will allow them to comply with the requirements of the protocol.\n* Significant underlying illness that in the opinion of the investigator would be expected to prevent completion of the study.\n* Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular injection unsafe.\n* Clinically suspected or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed ongoing episode of herpes zoster.\n* History of previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine (HZ/su vaccine; Shingrix) before the study start or planned receipt through study participation.\n* History of previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational live herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax) in the last 2 years from enrollment, or planned receipt through study participation.\n* Previous vaccination with licensed or investigational RSV vaccine.\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug, vaccine or medical device) other than the study interventions during the period beginning 30 days before the first dose of study interventions, or their planned use during the study period.\n* Planned or actual administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first study intervention administration and ending 30 days after the last study intervention administration.\n\n  o In the case of COVID-19 and inactivated/subunit/split influenza vaccines, this time window can be decreased to 14 days before and after each study intervention administration provided COVID-19 vaccine use is in line with local governmental recommendations.\n* Planned or actual administration of adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine influenza vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before the first study intervention administration and ending 30 days after the last study intervention administration.\n* Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 180 days before the administration of first dose of study interventions or planned administration at any time during the study period (e.g., infliximab).\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives during the period starting 90 days before the administration of first dose of study interventions or planned administration during the study period.\n* Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 consecutive days in total) of immunosuppressants or other immune modifying drugs during the period starting 90 days prior to the first study intervention dose or planned administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥20 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled, topical or intra-articular steroids are allowed.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the participant has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non investigational vaccine/product (IMP) (drug or invasive medical device).\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse as deemed by the investigator to render the potential participant unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports or comply with study procedures.Bedridden participants.\n* Planned move during the study conduct that prohibits participation until study end.\n* Participation of any study personnel or their immediate dependents, family, or household members.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Adjusted Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) of Anti-glycoprotein E (gE) Antibodies at 1 Month Post-second Dose of HZ/su Vaccination","description":"Anti-gE antibodies were measured with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the results were expressed as GMC, in milli international units per milliliter (mIU/mL).","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"49326.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"61192.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Adjusted Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) of Respiratory Syncytial Virus-A (RSV-A) Neutralizing Titers [Estimated Dilution 60 (ED60)] at 1 Month After the RSVPreF3 OA Vaccination","description":"Neutralizing titers were measured with neutralization assay and the results were expressed as GMT.
