Adults with kidney function ranging from estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \\<120 to \\>15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and spanning the entire range of human skin colors as defined by the Fitzpatrick Skin Scale (FSS) were included in the study.\n\nThe main questions that the study aimed to answer were:\n\n* To establish that the MB-102 transdermal fluorescence assessed GFR using the MediBeacon Transdermal GFR System with the TGFR reusable sensor with disposable adhesive ring was comparable to the measured MB-102 plasma GFR.\n* To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the MediBeacon Transdermal GFR System and the TGFR reusable sensor with disposable adhesive ring for the non-invasive transdermal fluorescence detection of MB-102 in participants\n\nOn dosing day, participants had the TGFR reusable sensor with disposable adhesive ring placed on their chest, and the MediBeacon Transdermal GFR System initiated to collect background fluorescence. When this was completed, participants then received a single dose of MB-102. Blood samples were collected and fluorescent measurements were taken over a 12- or 24-hour (or longer) period, depending upon enrollment group. For those with significant renal compromise, fluorescent measurements were continued until the sensor no longer detected MB-102 in the body. Following completion of the treatment period, participants returned to the study center approximately 1 week later for a safety follow-up visit. Researchers compared the results to see if the transdermal GFR measurements were comparable to the measured plasma GFR.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Correlation of Transdermal Derived Glomerular Filtration Rate (tGFR) to the Plasma-derived Indexed Glomerular Filtration Rate (nGFR)","timeFrame":"Up to 24 hours following the study dose","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Participants With eGFR ≥ 70 mL/Min/1.73 m^2","deltaMin":0.95,"sd":null},{"arm":"Participants With eGFR < 70 mL/Min/1.73 m^2","deltaMin":0.971,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":84},"commonTop":["HYPERTENSION","INJECTION SITE EXTRAVASATION","HEADACHE"]}}
