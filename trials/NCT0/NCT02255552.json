For each time point, 2 blocks of tissues were analyzed by Western blot, each with 2 replicates of gels to determine the dystrophin level as compared to a healthy individual (Percent Normal). The block average value from 2 replicate gels was computed. The overall average was calculated as the mean of the block average values. The overall average values were used for all analyses. In case only 1 gel was available for a block, then that value was used as the block average value.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.516","spread":"0.7236"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Having Ability to Rise Independently From the Floor Determined Based on North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) at Week 96","description":"NSAA is a clinician-administered scale that rates participant performance on 17-items and included assessments of abilities such as 10-meter walk/run, rising from a sit to stand, standing on 1 leg, climbing a box step, descending a box step, rising from lying to sitting, rising from the floor, lifting the head, standing on heels, and jumping. For all activities, participants were graded as follows: 0 = unable to achieve goal independently; 1 = modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another and 2 = normal, no obvious modification of activity.

This was not required if non ambulatory status occurred at the time of early withdrawal or at the end of Week 96 assessment.
