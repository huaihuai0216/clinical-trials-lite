Twenty patients will be enrolled and treated with 10-30 mg of Daytrana for a total of eight weeks. Changes in core hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention symptoms, autism spectrum symptoms and functional outcomes will be assessed. Acceptability of the transdermal route of administration in this population will also be assessed.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that Daytrana is a safe and effective medication for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders who have symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale - IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Total Score From Baseline to 8-week Follow-up Visit","timeFrame":"Baseline, 8 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Methylphenidate Transdermal System","deltaMin":39.9,"sd":7.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16080422"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":16},"commonTop":["fever","irritability","rhinorrhea","Headache","appetite, loss of"]}}
