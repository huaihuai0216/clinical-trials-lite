Modified Dakin's solution may reduce inflammation in the body, which may prevent or reduce dermatitis after radiation therapy.\n\nRadiation therapy in this study is regulatory medical care based on the patient's needs and the radiation oncologist's judgment. It is not possible nor necessary to explicitly define the dose or duration of treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Radiation Dermatitis","timeFrame":"From first radiation treatment up to 10 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.
