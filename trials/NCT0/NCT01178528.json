The 6 minute walking test was performed according to standardised procedure at baseline, before inclusion (at least 1 week after baseline evaluation), and at the end of the study. Patients who had not done at least two tests in the past underwent two practice 6 minute walking tests at least 3 days apart. Results are expressed in terms of distance walked (metres). The test was supervised by a physical therapist.\n\nPatients were asked to walk at their own maximal pace a 100 m long hospital corridor. At the beginning of the last (6th) minute of the test a standard phrase of encouragement was told. Patients were allowed to stop if signs or symptoms of significant distress occurred (dyspnea, angina), through they were instructed to resume walking as soon as possible.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"474.8","spread":"127.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"435.7","spread":"121.3"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"453.1","spread":"87.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Quality of Life","description":"Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which is a global measurement of QoL, allowing a subjective assessment of the impact of the disease and treatment.

It was designed for clinical assessment of patients by physicians as NYHA class I, II, III, or IV, on the basis of patient's limitations in physical activities caused by cardiac symptoms.\n\nClass I describes patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) but without resulting limitation of physical activity. There is no objective evidence of CVD.\n\nClass II describes patients with CVD resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. There is objective evidence of minimal CVD.\n\nClass III describes patients with CVD resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. There is objective evidence of moderately severe CVD.\n\nClass IV describes patients with CVD resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. There is objective evidence of severe CVD.\n\nHere we report data on number of patients showing an improvement by at least one NYHA class according to treatment allocation.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"20","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":41},"commonTop":[]}}}
