Patients will receive subcutaneous Mircera at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms every 4 weeks, calculated from the last weekly dose of epoetin or darbepoetin alfa previously administered. Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range. Treatment duration is 56 weeks, and the target sample size is 200 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Mean Hemoglobin Concentration Within +/- 1 g/dL of Their Reference Hb and Between 10.5 and 12.5 g/dL During Efficacy Evaluation Period","timeFrame":"EEP (Week 17 to Week 24)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"C.E.R.A.","deltaMin":52,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["Morocco"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":194},"commonTop":["Bronchitis","Gastrointestinal haemorrhage","Hypotension"]}}
