The change in neurocognitive performance from baseline to 6 months will be examined in relation to change in sleep onset latency. The unit of measure is a standardized z-score with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The unit of measurement is a correlation coefficient (Pearson's R2). The range is from -1.0 to 1.0. A zero indicates no correlation while values closer to -1.0 or 1.0 reflect a stronger association. A negative correlation suggests that as sleep latency decreased, neurocognitive functioning improved.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.09","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.16","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.04","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.001","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.07","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.02","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.15","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.03","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":58},"commonTop":["Headache","Somnolence","Fatigue","Incomnia","Diarrhea"]}}}
