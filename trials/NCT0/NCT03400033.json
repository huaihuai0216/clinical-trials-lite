This study includes a 4 week Screening Period, a 52 week Treatment Period and a 4 to 6 week follow-up period. Each subject will remain in the study for up to 62 weeks. Approximately 402 subjects will be randomized to receive either daprodustat three times weekly or epoetin alfa three-times weekly or once weekly, depending on dose level.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin Levels Over the Evaluation Period (Week 28 to Week 52)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) and evaluation period (Week 28 to Week 52)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Daprodustat","deltaMin":-0.04,"sd":0.045},{"arm":"Epoetin Alfa","deltaMin":0.02,"sd":0.066}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":91,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","France","Italy","Poland","Romania","Russia","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36005278","35918106"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":80,"n":270},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Hypertension","Vomiting","Headache","Hypotension"]}}
