Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 21 days before the initial injection of study drug in the first treatment cycle.\n\nAfter up to four treatment cycles, each subject will be followed for additional safety and efficacy assessments on Days 168 (± 7 days) and 252 (± 7 days) (nominal weeks 24 and 36).\n\nAfter the final injection of each treatment cycle, the investigator will model the plaque in an attempt to stretch or elongate the plaque. If the subject's penile curvature is reduced to \\<15° after the first, second, or third cycle of injections or if the investigator determines further treatment is not clinically indicated (eg, adverse events; allergic reaction), subsequent treatment cycles will not be administered.\n\nApproximately 300 subjects will be enrolled.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage Change From Baseline in Penile Curvature","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 36","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AA4500","deltaMin":-34.4,"sd":25.21}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Denmark","France","Germany","Italy","New Zealand","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25388099"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":347},"commonTop":["Penile haematoma","Penile pain","Injection site pain","Penile swelling","Injection site haematoma"]}}
