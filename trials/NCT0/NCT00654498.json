Written informed consent consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) / Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation given prior to any study procedures.\n2. Ability and willingness to comply with study treatment regimen and to attend study assessments.\n3. Male or female out-patients aged 18-80 years.\n4. Diagnosis of idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) according to the clinical Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG)\n\n   All four criteria must be present to fulfil the diagnosis of RLS:\n   * An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs.

(When symptoms are very severe, the worsening at night may not be noticeable but must have been previously present).\n5. Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)rating scale for severity total score \\>15.\n6.

Current (less than 14 days before treatment with trial medication or concomitant) treatment with medication or dietary supplements, which could significantly influence RLS symptoms, e.g. dopaminergic (other than levodopa or dopamine agonists) or anti-dopaminergic drugs, non-selective Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, sympathomimetics, neuroleptics, anti-depressants, hypnotics, any benzodiazepines, antiepileptics, opioids, clonidine, magnesium, ferrous salts, Folic acid, vitamin B12, antihistaminics, lithium, metoclopramide or Withdrawal symptoms caused by stopping any of the drugs above\n6. Confirmed diagnose of diabetic nephropathy or clinically significant renal disease\n7. Creatinine higher than upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening\n8. Clinical significant hepatic disease or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>2 times the upper limit of normal range at screening\n9. Clinical or laboratory signs of microcytic anaemia, or ferritin in serum below the lower bound of the reference range\n10. Any of the following lab results at screening:\n\n    * Basal Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), T3 or T4 clinically significantly (at the investigators discretion) out of normal range at screening (if not caused by substitution therapy according the investigators opinion)\n    * Patients with any clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory parameters at screening at the investigators discretion\n11.

Poorly controlled cardiovascular disease (including hypotension and severe coronary artery disease)\n12. History or clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy (PNP) of any origin in physical, neuro-logical examination, myelopathy or multiple sclerosis or any other neurological disease, with potential to secondarily cause RLS symptoms\n13.

History of alcohol abuse or drug addiction within the last 2 years before screening\n16. Participation in a drug study within two months prior to the start of this study\n17. History of or clinical signs for any form of epilepsy or seizures apart from fever related seizures in early childhood\n18. History of or clinical signs of malign neoplasm\n19. Patients on a shift-work-schedule, or who are otherwise unable to follow a regular sleep-wake cycle enabling use of study medication at times indicated\n20.
