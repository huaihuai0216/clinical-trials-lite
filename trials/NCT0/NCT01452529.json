The subject must not have had a nerve/plexus block within 4 weeks of the screening visit, neuroablation within 6 months of the screening visit, a botulinum toxin injection in the low back region within 3 months of the screening visit, steroid injections in the lower back within 6 weeks of the screening visit, or intravenous or intramuscular steroid injections within 4 weeks of the screening visit;\n* Subjects who have used any investigational medication within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication;\n* Subjects with any history of seizures (subjects with history of pediatric febrile seizures may participate in the study) or increase in intracranial pressure;\n* Subjects with current uncontrolled depression or other uncontrolled psychiatric disorder (subjects with controlled depression or other psychiatric disorder must be on a stable medication for ≥ 1 month prior to the screening visit to participate in the study);\n* Subjects with a history of alcohol, medication, or illicit drug abuse or addiction and/or history of opioid abuse or addiction at any time;\n* Subjects with clinically unstable cardiac disease, including: unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, active myocardial ischemia, or indwelling pacemaker;\n* Subjects with unstable respiratory disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, precludes entry into this study;\n* Subjects with evidence of impaired liver function upon entry into the study (laboratory test values ≥ 3 times the upper limit of the laboratory reference (normal) range (ULN) for aspartate transaminase \\[AST/SGOT\\] or alanine transaminase \\[ALT/SGPT\\], or values \\> 2 times the ULN for alkaline phosphatase), or total bilirubin level \\> 1.5 times the ULN or, in the opinion of the investigator/medically qualified designee (must be MD or DO), liver function impairment to the extent that the subject should not participate in this study;\n* Subjects with evidence of impaired kidney function upon entry into the study (ie, serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL);\n* Subjects with biliary tract disease, hypothyroidism, adrenal cortical insufficiency, or any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, is inadequately treated and precludes entry into the study;\n* Subjects who had surgical procedures directed towards the source of chronic low back pain within 6 months of the screening visit or scheduled for surgery of the lower back or any other major surgery during the study conduct period;\n* Subjects with history of malignancy within past 2 years, with exception of basal cell carcinoma that has been successfully treated;\n* Subjects with any condition in which opioids are contraindicated, eg, severe respiratory depression with hypoxia and/or hypercapnia, severe chronic obstructive lung disease, cor pulmonale, severe bronchial asthma, or paralytic ileus;\n* Subjects who are allergic to hydrocodone or who have a history of allergies to other opioids. This does not include subjects who have experienced common opioid side effects (eg, nausea, constipation);\n* Subjects receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or who have been taking MAOIs within 2 weeks of the screening visit.\n\nOther protocol-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Pain Intensity for \"Average Pain Over the Last 24 Hours\" Score","description":"Mean pain intensity for \"average pain over the last 24 hours\" score (on an 11-point numerical rating scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.7","spread":"0.13"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.2","spread":"0.13"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale - Revised (MOS Sleep-R) - Sleep Disturbance Subscale","description":"The MOS Sleep-R is a brief, self-administered 12-item assessment designed to measure key aspects of sleep.

The sleep disturbance subscale comprised the responses to questions 1, 3, 7, and 8 on the assessment.
