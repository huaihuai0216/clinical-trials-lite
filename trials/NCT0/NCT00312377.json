Vandetanib is a new type of agent that targets the blood supply to a cancer tumour (through it's anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) properties) and the tumour cells themselves (through it's anti-endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) actions). This study will look at the effects of vandetanib in lung cancer patients who have had their cancer re-appear after treatment with standard chemotherapy.\n\nThis clinical study will test if the vandetanib anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR characteristics can deliver longer improved progression free survival and improved overall survival than docetaxel (Taxotere) alone.\n\nAll patients participating this clinical study will receive treatment with docetaxel, a commonly used treatment for recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIn addition, some patients will also receive vandetanib (ZACTIMA), an anti-EGFR / anti-VEGF agent.\n\nRecent clinical research shows that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition, when used with standard chemotherapy, can lead to increased survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\n\nOther research shows that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, like erlotinib (Tarceva) can also increase overall non-small cell lung cancer survival by killing tumour cells and stopping them from dividing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in the Overall Population","timeFrame":"RECIST tumour assessments carried out every 6 weeks from randomisation until the date of first documented objective disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first assessed up to 24 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vandetanib 100 mg Plus Docetaxel","deltaMin":17.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Plus Docetaxel","deltaMin":14,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":156,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","China","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","India","Indonesia","Italy","Japan","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","Portugal","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","Vietnam"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33075149","25881079","25057173","20570559"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=340&filename=CSR-D4200C00032.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_7111&studyid=340&filename=vandetanib_Study_32_ZODIAC_CSP_Redacted.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":263,"n":694},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Alopecia","Rash","Fatigue","Anorexia"]}}
