Note: Please advise the participant that for this questionnaire they are to interpret the instructions as referring to glasses or contacts they need for seeing objects at a distance (if required), not their reading glasses or bifocals.\n* Photopic, high-contrast, best distance correction in the range of spherical -4.00 D to +1.00 D inclusively and cylinder \\< = + -2.00 D with photopic at the screening visit and photopic, high-contrast BCDVA of 20/25 or better OD and OS at the screening visit.\n* Photopic, high-contrast HDVA of 20/32 or better OU at screening as well as before and 1 hour after dosing at both driving tests. Only monofocal correction (either spectacles or contact lenses) is allowed for the driving tests. If the participant does not have monofocal correction of 20/32 or better OU, the study site will provide monofocal spectacles.\n* Mesopic, high-contrast DCNVA of 20/40 to 20/100 OD and OS at screening\n* Photopic, high-contrast near visual acuity correctable to 20/40 or better in each eye at the screening visit.\n* Mesopic pupil diameter \\< 8.0 mm in both eyes at the screening visit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of cataract surgery, phakic intraocular lens surgery, corneal inlay surgery, radial keratotomy, or any intraocular surgery.\n* Use of any topical ophthalmic medications, including artificial tears other than the study medications during the study.\n* Use of temporary or permanent punctal plugs or history of punctal cautery in one or both eyes.\n* Corneal abnormalities in either eye that are likely to interfere with visual acuity.\n* Narrow iridocomeal angles, history of angle-closure glaucoma, or previous iridotomy.\n* Diagnosis of any type of glaucoma or ocular hypertension.\n* Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy during the study.\n* Uncontrolled systemic disease.\n* Severe dry eye disease.\n* History of iris trauma.\n* Lens opacity in either eye that is determined to cause significant disturbance of the central visual axis on screening biomicroscopy.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"55 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Composite Driving Z Score Approximately 1 Hour After Study Intervention Instillation","description":"An overall composite driving Z-score approximately 1 hour after study intervention instillation was derived to capture the overall driving performance of each participant compared with the whole group for the following parameters: percent hazards hit, percent sign recognition and recognition distance, pedestrian recognition distances, and percent of time outside of the lane. For each participant, the Z-score for each task of the driving test was the difference between his/her value and mean value of the assessments of all participants from the pooled data of both periods combined, divided by the standard deviation of all corresponding assessment values. Because a lower percentage of hazards hit, lower percentage of time outside of the driving lane, and a shorter lap duration indicate better driving performance, the Z-scores of these components were reversed (multiplied by -1) before computing the overall composite driving Z-score. A higher Z-score indicates better driving performance.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.118","spread":"0.4011"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.121","spread":"0.4503"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events","description":"An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention.
