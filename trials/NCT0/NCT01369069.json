The study hypotheses are that treatment of hyperglycemic acute ischemic stroke patients with targeted glucose concentration (80mg/dL - 130 mg/dL) will be safe and result in improved 3 month outcome after stroke.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Favorable Modified Rankin Scale (Yes/No)","timeFrame":"90 days (-14/+30 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IV Insulin Drip With Target Glucose 80 mg/dL - 130 mg/dL","deltaMin":119,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sub Q Insulin to Keep Glucose Less Than 180 mg/dL","deltaMin":123,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.55"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31334795","38626363","36333676","25885963","24499406","23506245"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":209,"n":581},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Haemorrhagic transformation stroke","Atrial fibrillation","Headache","Neurological decompensation"]}}
