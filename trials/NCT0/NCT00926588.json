Pain is particularly prevalent among veterans. Four major barriers to optimal care include underdetection of pain, inadequate initial treatment, failure to monitor adherence and symptom response, and failure to adjust treatment in patients not responding or intolerant of initial therapy. Therefore, we propose to conduct the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness (SCOPE) study, a randomized clinical effectiveness trial in primary care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Brief Pain Inventory (Pain)","timeFrame":"1 year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Stepped Care","deltaMin":3.57,"sd":2.22},{"arm":"Usual Care","deltaMin":4.59,"sd":2.13}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23228858","23639186","24369044","25027139","27187854","25786741","25138978"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":124},"commonTop":[]}}
