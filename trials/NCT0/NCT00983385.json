This is a clinical effectiveness trial designed to establish a link between anticipated clinical outcomes and the clinical practice by means of selected measures of clinical and subject-reported outcome.\n\nThe trial will compare the effectiveness of previous analgesic treatment (either WHO Step I or Step II analgesics or no regular analgesics) with that of tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release (PR) treatment during defined periods of evaluation.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Primary Endpoint is Defined as the Change of the Average Pain Intensity Score on an 11-point NRS-3 at Week 6 From Week -1 (Baseline).","timeFrame":"Baseline; End of Week 6 (6 Weeks)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tapentadol","deltaMin":-2.8,"sd":2.12}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":46,"countries":["Austria","Croatia","France","Germany","Italy","Poland","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22443293"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":176},"commonTop":["Nausea","Dizziness","Headache","Dry mouth","Fatigue"]}}
