Visit 1 or planned vaccination within 3 weeks following the last study vaccination;\n* History of (or current) drug or alcohol abuse that in the investigator's opinion would interfere with safety of the subject or the evaluation of study objectives;\n* Members of research staff and their relatives;\n* Any condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of
