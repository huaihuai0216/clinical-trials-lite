A key secondary objective is to identify the duration of treatment required to demonstrate the superiority of the FDC over both of the monotherapies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Trough Seated Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) at Week 8","timeFrame":"baseline and week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"T80+A10","deltaMin":-47.5,"sd":0.69},{"arm":"Telmisartan 80 mg","deltaMin":-36.9,"sd":0.96},{"arm":"Amlodipine 10 mg","deltaMin":-43.2,"sd":0.95}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":137,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Czechia","France","Hungary","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","South Korea","Spain","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":421},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Headache"]}}
