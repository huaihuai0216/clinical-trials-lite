Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.\n2. Male or female patients aged 18 - 75 years.\n3. Patients must have confirmed Cushing's disease that is persistent or recurrent.\n4. Patients with a history of prior pituitary surgery must be at least 30 days post-surgery to be eligible for inclusion in this study.\n5. Patients that received glucocorticoid replacement therapy post-operatively must have discontinued such therapy for at least one week, or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to screening.\n6. Patients with de novo Cushing's disease can be included only if they are not considered candidates for surgery.\n7. Patients with a history of pituitary irradiation can be included, provided that at least 2 years (stereotactic radiosurgery) or 3 years (conventional radiation) have elapsed from the time of last radiation treatment to the time of enrollment into this study.\n8. Patients are permitted to washout current drug therapy to meet these entry criteria if they have a known diagnosis of Cushing's disease.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5 half lives at the time of enrollment, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations, and for any other limitation of participation in an investigational trial based on local regulations.\n2. History of hypersensitivity to LCI699 or to drugs of similar chemical classes.\n3. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.\n4. Patients with risk factors for QTc prolongation or Torsade de Pointes.\n5. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.\n6. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and for 1 week after completion of dosing.\n7. Patients with compression of the optic chiasm due to a macroadenoma or patients at high risk of compression of the optic chiasm (tumor within 2 mm of optic chiasm).\n8. Patients who have a known inherited syndrome as the cause for hormone over secretion.\n9. Patients with Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion or ACTH-independent (adrenal) Cushing's syndrome.\n10. Patients who have undergone major surgery within 1 month prior to screening.\n11. Hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure.\n12. Diabetic patients with poorly controlled diabetes.\n13. Patients who are not euthyroid as judged by the investigator.\n14. Patients who have a history of: congestive heart failure, unstable angina, sustained ventricular tachycardia, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block, acute MI less than one year prior to study entry, or clinically significant impairment in cardiovascular function.\n15. Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.\n16. Patients with liver disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis, or chronic persistent hepatitis, or patients with defined elevated ALT/ AST/ Bilirubin.\n17. Patients who have any current or prior medical condition that can interfere with the conduct of the study or the evaluation of its results in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor.\n18. Patients who have a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the 6 month period prior to study treatment.\n19.
