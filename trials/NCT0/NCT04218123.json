Given the lack of high level evidence for treatments, we seek to perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover, pilot trial of venlafaxine for treating Meniere's disease. Venlafaxine is a safe and well-tolerated medication. It has never been trialed in Meniere's disease, but there is evidence that it could be effective in helping with vertigo attacks and other aspects of the disorder.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Vertigo Episodes","timeFrame":"6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Venlafaxine Arm","deltaMin":5.41,"sd":4.44},{"arm":"Placebo Arm","deltaMin":5.03,"sd":4.57},{"arm":"Baseline Score","deltaMin":13.78,"sd":10.05}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.05"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.05"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":">0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":20,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39235772"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":40},"commonTop":["Nausea/vomiting","Dry mouth","Decreased Appetite","Sweating","Insomnia"]}}
