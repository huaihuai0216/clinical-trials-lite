Obesity, defined as a body mass index of 30.0 or higher, is accountable for 44% of the diabetes, 23% of the ischemic heart disease and between 7% and 41% of certain cancers. The Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser (which will be used in this study) has been approved by the FDA (K123237) as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment which can be used by individuals intending to reduce circumference of hips, waist, and thighs. Lorcaserin is a selective serotonin 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor agonist. The exact mechanism of action is not known, but lorcaserin is believed to promote satiety and decrease food intake by activating 5-HT(2C) receptors on anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin neurons in the hypothalamus. Lorcaserin was approved by the FDA on June 2012 for weight management in people with a BMI of \\> 27 kg/m2 (overweight) when accompanied by a weigh-related condition such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure or in people with a BMI \\> 30 kg/m2 (obese). The purpose of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on: 1) effectiveness of the combination of LLLT and lorcaserin for reducing abdominal subcutaneous fat in overweight/obese individuals; 2) impact of LLLT on inflammatory biomarkers, blood sugar, and cholesterol.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Waist Circumference","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LLLT","deltaMin":-2.3,"sd":4.1},{"arm":"Lorcaserin","deltaMin":-6,"sd":7.3},{"arm":"LLLT and Lorcaserin","deltaMin":-4,"sd":5.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.398"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.436"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27708788"],"seeAlso":["http://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-016-0122-4"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":["nausea","Headache","dizziness","Low Blood Pressure","Tingling"]}}
