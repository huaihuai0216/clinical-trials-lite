An adverse event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a preexisting medical condition after or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. A TEAE is an AE occurring on or after the date of the first dose of study drug or worsening relative to the pre-treatment state. An SAE is an AE that fulfils one or more of the following: results in death; is immediately life-threatening; requires hospitalization nor prolongation of hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect; or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to present one of the outcomes listed above.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Intraocular Pressure in the Study Eye","description":"Intraocular pressure is the fluid pressure inside the eye.

The primary purpose of the vitreous body is to keep the center of the eye clear so that light can get to the retina and vision can begin. Vitreous haze involves the obstruction of the back of the eye by vitreous cells and protein exudation. In this study, vitreous haze was graded following a standardized photographic scale ranging from 0 to 4. The following scale was used to grade the vitreous haze: 0 = no inflammation, +0.5 = trace inflammation, +1 = mild blurring of the retinal vessels and optic nerve, +1.5 = optic nerve head and posterior retina view obscuration greater than +1 but less than +2, +2 = moderate blurring of the optic nerve head, +3 = marked blurring of the optic nerve head, +4 = optic nerve head not visible.
