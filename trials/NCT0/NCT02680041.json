Consenting participants will be imaged with 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT. Site clinicians will manage study subjects per standard practices and will document any change in treatment based on review of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT findings. All participants will be followed for up to 6 months, with clinical data collected for this study. An interdisciplinary panel will provide expert guidance to local readers on request. The final reporting of the PET/CT scan will be a single report by the local reader following any such discussion.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Fraction of Patients for Whom 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT Alters Patient Planned Treatment Through Detection of Disease.","timeFrame":"2-22 days post PET CT","effectByArm":[{"arm":"18F-fluciclovine PET CT","deltaMin":126,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37121865","31216198"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":213},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Headache","Constipation","Haematuria","Nocturia"]}}
