We also want to find out if there is a difference between how much three commonly used trocars slide and if a device called LaproStop has an effect on the slippage.\n\nPatients will be randomly assigned into the different trocar groups. After this assignment has been made, we will then assign the Laprostop to one of the two trocars by chance.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Trocar Slippages With LaproStop","timeFrame":"During the hysterectomy procedure, up to 2 hours and 32 minutes","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Covidien Versaport Trocars","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ethicon Xcel Trocars","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Storz Reusable Trocars","deltaMin":3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":5},"commonTop":[]}}
