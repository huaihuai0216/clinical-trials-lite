Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the 23 hours 10 min and the 23 hours 45 min post dose values. Trough FEV1 was analyzed using a mixed model for the PPS-S. The model contained treatment as a fixed effect with the baseline FEV1, FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 15 min post-inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA reversibility at Visit 2), FEV1 prior to inhalation and FEV1 60 min post-inhalation of ipratropium (components of anti-cholinergic reversibility at Visit 3) as covariates. Smoking history (current or ex-smoker) was included as a factor in the model.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.134","spread":"0.0008"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.145","spread":"0.0008"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Rate of COPD Exacerbations","description":"COPD exacerbations were defined as :Worsening of 2 or more major symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days: dyspnea; sputum volume; suputum purulence AND requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics OR Worsening of any 1 major symptom together with any 1 of the following minor symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days: Sore throat; colds; fever without other cause; increased cough; increase wheeze AND requiring treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or antibiotics.
