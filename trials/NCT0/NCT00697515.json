Treatment with a stable dose of thyroid medication for at least 3 months is permitted.\n* Subject has a history of moderate to severe hypertension or has a resting sitting systolic blood pressure \\>139mmHg or diastolic blood pressure \\>89mmHg.\n* Subject has a documented allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to amphetamines.\n* Subject has failed to respond to one or more adequate courses (dose and duration) of amphetamine therapy.\n* Subject has glaucoma.\n* Subject is taking other medications that have central nervous system (CNS) effects or affect performance, such as sedating antihistamines and decongestant sympathomimetics, or are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (during or within 14 days of test or reference product administration).
