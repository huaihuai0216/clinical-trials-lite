Tramadol is a currently approved medication used to treat moderate-severe pain, and initial studies demonstrate that it may be useful for treatment of the uncomfortable syndrome of opioid withdrawal without producing euphoric effects. This study will determine whether two different doses of extended release tramadol can treat opioid withdrawal and whether tramadol itself produces withdrawal after it is no longer taken.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Total Adjective Score","timeFrame":"Days 1-7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tramadol 200 mg Daily","deltaMin":5.8,"sd":0.1},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.7,"sd":0.1},{"arm":"Tramadol 600 mg Daily","deltaMin":6.9,"sd":0.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23755929"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["abdominal pain","unsteady urine flow without dysuria","sore throat/strep B","fleeting chest pain","left shoulder pain"]}}
