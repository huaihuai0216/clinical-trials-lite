People who are in hospital on breathing support can participate in the study. The purpose of the study is to find out whether a medicine called alteplase helps people get better faster.\n\nThe study has 2 parts. In the first part, participants are put into 3 groups by chance. Participants in 2 of the groups get 2 different doses of alteplase, in addition to standard treatment.\n\nParticipants in the third group get standard treatment. In the second part of the study, participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group gets alteplase and standard treatment. The other group gets only standard treatment. Alteplase is given as an infusion into a vein. In both study parts, treatments are given for 5 days. Doctors monitor patients and check whether their breathing problems improve. They compare results between the groups after 1 month.\n\nParticipants are in the study for 3 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Clinical Improvement or Hospital Discharge up to Day 28","timeFrame":"Up to 28 days.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part 1: Alteplase Low Dose","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 1: Alteplase High Dose","deltaMin":19,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 1: Standard of Care","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2: Alteplase High Dose - Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation (NIV) Patients","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2: Standard of Care - Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilation (NIV) Patients","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2: Alteplase High Dose - Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) Patients","deltaMin":25.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part 2: Standard of Care - Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) Patients","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":null},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":37,"countries":["Austria","Belgium","Brazil","France","Germany","India","Italy","Malaysia","Mexico","Netherlands","Russia","Spain","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39522090"],"seeAlso":["https://www.mystudywindow.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":20},"commonTop":["Constipation","Pneumonia","Hypokalaemia","Epistaxis","Hyperkalaemia"]}}
