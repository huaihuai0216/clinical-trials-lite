The secondary objective is to characterize the immunologic response to CP administration.\n\nThis study will enroll adults presenting to the emergency department (ED) with mild, symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness, who are at high risk for progression to severe/critical illness, but who are clinically stable for outpatient management at randomization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Disease Progression (Intention-to-treat Population)","timeFrame":"15 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Convalescent Plasma","deltaMin":77,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":81,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":53,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34407339"],"seeAlso":["http://hbiostat.org/proj/covid19/bayesplan.html"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":59,"n":257},"commonTop":["Dyspnea","Infusion related reaction","Chest pain","Pneumonia","Vomiting"]}}
