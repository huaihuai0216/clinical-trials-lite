Should have received the sulfonylurea monotherapy for at least the 3 months prior to Screening; has been on a stable sulfonylurea dose equivalent to at least 10 mg of glyburide (Exception: documented maximum tolerated dose equivalent to less than 10 mg but at least 5 mg glyburide) for at least 8 weeks.\n* No treatment with antidiabetic agents other than a sulfonylurea within the 3 months prior to Screening. (Exception: if a subject has received other antidiabetic therapy for less than 7 days within the 3 months prior to Screening.)\n* Body mass index greater than or equal to 23 kg/m2 and less than or equal to 45 kg/m2.\n* Fasting C-peptide concentration greater than or equal to 0.8 ng/mL. (If this screening criterion is not met, the subject still qualifies if C-peptide is greater than or equal to 1.5 ng/mL after a challenge test.).\n* Glycosylated hemoglobin concentration between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive.\n* If regular use of other, non-excluded medications, must be on a stable dose for at least the 4 weeks prior to Screening.

If elevated, the subject may be rescreened within 1 week.\n* History of cancer, other than squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, that has not been in full remission for at least 5 years prior to Screening. (A history of treated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II is allowed.)\n* History of laser treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy within the 6 months prior to Screening.\n* History of treated diabetic gastric paresis.\n* New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure regardless of therapy. Currently treated subjects who are stable at Class I or II are candidates for the study.\n* History of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or myocardial infarction within the 6 months prior to Screening.\n* History of any hemoglobinopathy that may affect determination of glycosylated hemoglobin.\n* History of infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus.\n* History of a psychiatric disorder that will affect the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n* History of angioedema in association with use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor inhibitors.\n* History of alcohol or substance abuse within the 2 years prior to Screening.\n* Receipt of any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to Screening or a history of receipt of an investigational antidiabetic drug within the 3 months prior to Screening.\n* Prior treatment in an investigational study of alogliptin.\n* Excluded Medications and Treatments:\n\n  * Treatment with antidiabetic agents other than study drug or glyburide is not allowed within the 3 months prior to Screening and through the completion of the end-of-treatment/early termination procedures.\n  * Treatment with weight-loss drugs, any investigational antidiabetics, Bosentan (used for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension), or oral or systemically injected glucocorticoids is not allowed from 3 months prior to randomization through the completion of the end-of- treatment/early termination procedures. Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.\n  * Subjects must not take any medications, including over-the-counter products, without first consulting with the investigator.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80
