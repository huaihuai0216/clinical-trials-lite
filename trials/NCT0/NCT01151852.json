Female patients must have had a negative pregnancy test within one week before starting imatinib.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Progression-free Survival","description":"To compare the progression free survival (PFS) assessed by the blinded independent central review following resumption of dosing (re-challenge) with Imatinib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST following failure of at least prior imatinib and sunitinib therapies","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Disease Control Rate","description":"Inclusion of complete response, partial response or stable disease\n\nPer Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \\>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR; Progressive disease (PD), \\>20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), Insufficient change to qualify for PR or PD.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"32","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Progression Free Survival","description":"To compare PFS assessed by investigators","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Response Rate","description":"Tumour responses were initially determined by the local investigators in accordance with RECIST 1.0.Treatment decisions were based on local onsite radiological review.
