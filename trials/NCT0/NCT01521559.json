Uncontrolled glaucoma defined as ≥ 25 mmHg on optimal medical regimen, or previous filtration surgery in either the study eye or the fellow eye\n3. Insufficient clearing of macular hemorrhage that would prevent the patient from receiving laser treatment safely on day 1 (patients that meet this criterion may be rescreened once the macular hemorrhage resolves)\n4.
