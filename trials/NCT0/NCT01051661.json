NOTE: The subject may be vaccinated at a later date, provided symptoms have resolved, vaccination occurs within the window specified by the protocol, and all other eligibility criteria continue to be satisfied.\n* Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).\n* Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment (first dose of study vaccine), or any other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrollment. Topical, intra-articular or inhaled glucocorticoids are allowed.\n* Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 6 months of study enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.\n* Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin are eligible if no such doses are given in the 24 hours before a study vaccination. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g., low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency, are eligible.\n* An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine.\n* Administration of any licensed live attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks before the first vaccination or of any licensed inactivated vaccine within 2 weeks before the first vaccination.\n* Planned administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol between Day 0 and Day 42. Routine childhood vaccinations are exempted if they cannot be delayed, but they must not be administered on the same day as the H1N1 vaccine candidate.\n* Planned use of a pandemic monovalent A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)v-like virus vaccine other than the study vaccines during the study period.\n* Planned administration of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine during the 4 month period following Day 0.\n* Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study vaccine(s) within 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines (including egg proteins or mercurial preservatives); a history of anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.\n* Child in care.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"6 Months","maximumAge":"9
