In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing chemical peels at the NLF area for the duration of the study.\n* Had any treatment with Botox® injections in the upper 1/3 of the face within 2 weeks prior to entry into the study, or in the lower 2/3 of the face within 24 weeks prior to entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from receiving Botox injections in the face for the duration of the study.\n* Received prior therapy to the face and/or neck (e.g., dermabrasion, face-lift, Thermage®,laser resurfacing, contour threads, non-ablative laser treatments) within 24 weeks prior to study entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing such therapy for the duration of the study.\n* Had previous tissue augmentation at the NLF area within 24 weeks prior to study entry. In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing tissue augmentation at the NLF area for the duration of the study.\n* Had previous treatment at the NLF area with permanent implants (e.g., silicone,Softform®) or long-lasting fillers (e.g., RadiesseTM, Sculptra®, ArteFill® \\[Artecoll\\], or Bio-AlcamidTM). In addition, subjects were restricted from undergoing treatment with permanent implants or long-lasting fillers at the NLF area for the duration of the study.\n* Had evidence of scar-related disease or delayed healing activity within one year prior to study enrollment. (Note: subjects with scars were eligible for study enrollment, although scars at the intended treatment sites were not treated.)\n* Had a history of keloid formation.\n* Had a history of hypo- or hyperpigmentation of the skin.\n* Had any infection, unhealed wound, or active inflammatory process (e.g., skin eruptions such as cysts, pimples, rashes, or hives) at the injection site(s).\n* Immunocompromised/immunosuppressed (e.g., HIV-positive, transplant recipient, or presently receiving chemotherapy).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the Blinded Evaluator's Assessment of Nasolabial Fold (NLF) Wrinkle Severity at Week 24","description":"This was a comparison of the mean change between Baseline and the Week 24 score (baseline minus week 24 scores) in the blinded evaluators' assessments of NLF wrinkle severity.
