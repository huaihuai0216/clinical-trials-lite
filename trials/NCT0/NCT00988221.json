In Part I of the study, all patients received intravenous (iv) infusions of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg for patients ≥ 30kg, 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for patients \\< 30kg) every 4 weeks for 16 weeks. In Part II of the study, patients with an adequate response in Part I were randomized to receive either tocilizumab at the same dose as in Part I or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks. In Part III of the study, patients received tocilizumab at the same dose as in Part I every 4 weeks for up to another 64 weeks. Standard of care therapy with or without non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroids, or methotrexate was continued throughout the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent of Patients With a Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) American College of Rheumatology 30 (ACR30) Flare in Part II of the Study (Weeks 16-40)","timeFrame":"Week 16 through Week 40","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":48.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Tocilizumab 8 or 10 mg/kg","deltaMin":25.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":69,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Peru","Poland","Russia","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36651601","32912276","30824645","24834925"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":22},"commonTop":["Juvenile arthritis","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Pharyngitis","Cough"]}}
