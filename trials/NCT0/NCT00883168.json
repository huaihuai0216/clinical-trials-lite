Male/female subjects 12 years of age and older\n2. Provide written informed consent/pediatric assent.\n3. Subjects must have moderate-to-severe rhinitis, with one or more of the following present:\n\n   1. Sleep disturbance\n   2. Impairment of daily activities, leisure and/or sport\n   3. Impairment of school or work\n   4. Troublesome symptoms\n4. Screening Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS of at least 8 out of a possible 12 and a congestion score of 2 or 3 on Visit 1\n5. Randomization Visit: For the 3 days prior to Randomization and on the morning of Randomization, the sum of the 7 consecutive reflective AM and PM TNSS assessments shall be equal to or greater than 56, with a nasal congestion score equal to or greater than 14\n6. Randomization Visit: instantaneous TNSS score of at least 8 and a congestion score of at least 2 just prior to beginning the onset of action assessment\n7. Have taken at least 10 doses of the lead-in medication\n8. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements\n9. At least a 2-year history of SAR during the current allergy season\n10. The presence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a prevailing, individual, seasonal pollen, confirmed by a positive response to skin prick within the last year.\n11. General good health and free of any disease or concomitant treatment that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results.\n12. Subjects receiving immunotherapy injections (antigen desensitization) must be on a stable maintenance regimen for at least 30 days before the first study visit\n13. Subjects currently receiving sublingual immunotherapy are excluded. A 6-month washout period is required following the last dose of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. On Focused Nasal Examination, the presence of any superficial and moderate nasal mucosal erosion, nasal mucosal ulceration, or nasal septum perforation (Grade 1b - 4) at either the screening visit or randomization visit will disqualify the subject from the study.\n2. Other nasal disease(s) likely to affect deposition of intranasal medication.\n3. Nasal surgery or sinus surgery within the previous year.\n4. Chronic sinusitis - more than 3 episodes per year\n5. Planned travel outside of the pollen area during the study period\n6. The use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Visit 1. No investigational products are permitted for use during the conduct of this study\n7. Presence of any hypersensitivity to drugs similar to azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate\n8. Women who are pregnant or nursing\n9. Women of childbearing potential who are not abstinent or not practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception\\* see section 6.1.1\n10. Respiratory Tract Infections within 14 days prior to Visit 1\n11. Respiratory Tract Infections requiring antibiotic treatment 14 days prior to Visit 1\n12. Asthma (with the exception of intermittent asthma).\n13. Significant pulmonary disease including COPD\n14. Clinically significant arrhythmia or symptomatic cardiac conditions\n15. A known history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years\n16. Existence of any surgical or medical condition or physical or laboratory findings, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug; that might significantly affect the subject's ability to complete this trial; or their safety in this trial.\n17. Patients with a history of glaucoma\n18. Clinically relevant abnormal physical findings within 1 week of randomization may preclude compliance with the study procedures\n19. Employees of the research center or private practice and their family members\n20. no more than 50% of their subjects have participated in protocol MP4001, MP4002 or MP4004","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in 12 Hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)","description":"change from baseline in 12-hour reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS)consisting of nasal congestion,runny nose, itchy nose and sneezing scored twice daily (AM and PM) in diary cards for the entire 14 day study period.The measurement scale is 0 to 24.A reduction in symptom severity score is indicated by a negative value.An greater negative value is suggestive of improvement.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.5","spread":"5.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.8","spread":"4.8"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.9","spread":"4.7"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-3.4","spread":"4.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in 12 Hour Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS)","description":"change from baseline in 12-hour instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS)consisting of nasal congestion,runny nose, itchy nose and sneezing scored twice daily (AM and PM) in diary cards for the entire 14 day study period.The measurement scale is 0 to 24.A reduction in symptom severity score is indicated by a negative value.A greater negative score is suggestive of improved condition.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.0","spread":"5.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.3","spread":"4.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-4.7","spread":"4.9"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-3.1","spread":"4.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Adult Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)","description":"adult Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) scored at day 1(baseline) and at day 14.The scale is measured from a value of 0 to 24.
