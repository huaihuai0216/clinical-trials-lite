Thrombocytopenia secondary to other diseases (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \\[AIDS\\] or systemic lupus erythematosus \\[SLE\\]), or drug-related thrombocytopenia.\n2. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV), anti-D immunoglobulin or thrombopoietin receptor agonists, or other platelet enhancing drugs (including immunosuppressive or other immunomodulatory drugs) within 3 weeks before enrollment, except for:\n\n   * Long-term corticosteroid therapy when the dose has been stable during the preceding 3 weeks and no dosage change is planned until study Day 22.\n   * Long-term azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or attenuated androgen therapy when the dose has been stable during the preceding 3 months and no dosage change is planned until study Day 22.\n3.
