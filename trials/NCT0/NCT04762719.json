Currently, there are no non-invasive ways to study macrophage activation in humans. The researchers are trying to determine the utility of 11C-ER176 based PET-CT scanning to determine pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in gastric wall of patients with diabetic gastroparesis.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Uptake of 11C-ER 176 in the Stomach Muscle","timeFrame":"baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Diabetic Gastroparesis Subjects","deltaMin":5.5,"sd":1},{"arm":"Diabetic Without Gastroparesis Subjects","deltaMin":8.4,"sd":4.1},{"arm":"Healthy Subjects","deltaMin":4.6,"sd":0.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":4},"commonTop":["Sore throat","Uvular abrasion","Urinary Tract Infection"]}}
