Participants have at least 1-year history of migraines (with or without aura), consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorder, 3rd Edition, including the following:\n\n1. Migraine attacks present for more than 1 year with the age of onset prior to 50 years of age.\n2. Migraine attacks, on average, lasting about 4-72 hours if untreated.\n3. Not more than 8 attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the last 3 months.\n4. At least 2 consistent migraine headache attacks of moderate or severe intensity in each of the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and throughout the Screening Period.\n5. Less than 15 days with headache (migraine or non-migraine) per month in each of the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit and throughout the Screening Period.\n6. Participants on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy provided they have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Screening Visit and the dose is not expected to change during the course of the study.\n7. Participants with contraindications for use of triptans may be included provided they meet all other study entry criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Participant with a history of basilar migraine or hemiplegic migraine.\n2. Participant with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease.\n3. Participant history with current evidence of uncontrolled, unstable or recently diagnosed cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, and cerebral ischemia. Participants with myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac surgery, stroke or transient ischemic attack during the 6 months prior to screening.\n4. Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure), or uncontrolled diabetes (however subjects can be included who have stable hypertension and/or diabetes for at least 3 months prior to being enrolled).\n5. Participant has a current diagnosis of major depression, other pain syndromes, psychiatric conditions (for example, schizophrenia), dementia, or significant neurological disorders (other than migraine) that, in the Investigator's opinion might interfere with study assessments.\n6. Participant has a history of gastric, or small intestinal surgery (including gastric bypass, gastric banding, gastric sleeve, gastric balloon, etc.), or has disease that causes malabsorption.\n7. The participant has a history of current or evidence of any significant and/ or unstable medical conditions (for example, history of congenital heart disease or arrhythmia, known suspected infection, hepatitis B or C, or cancer) that, in the Investigator's opinion, would expose them to undue risk of a significant adverse event or interfere with assessments of safety or efficacy during the course of the trial.\n8. History of, treatment for, or evidence of, alcohol or drug abuse within the past 12 months or subjects who have met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth edition (DSM-V) criteria for any significant substance use disorder within the past 12 months from the date of the Screening Visit.\n9. History of nasal surgery in the 6 months preceding the Screening Visit.\n10. Participation in any other investigational clinical trial while participating in this clinical trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Freedom From Pain at 2 Hours Post-dose","description":"Pain levels were assessed on a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, severe) using the electronic clinical outcome assessment (eCOA) handheld device.
