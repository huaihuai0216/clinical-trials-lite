The investigators hypothesize that treatment of rosacea with azelaic acid will lead to a decreased Demodex folliculorum count as well as an improvement in lesion count and redness.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Demodex Count","timeFrame":"Week 4","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Azelaic Acid Left/no Treatment Right","deltaMin":40,"sd":null},{"arm":"Azelaic Acid Right /no Treatment Left","deltaMin":18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
