either:\n\n* Completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP (CSL654) study, including study CSL654\\_3001 \\[NCT01496274\\] or study CSL654\\_3002 \\[NCT01662531\\].\n\nOr:\n\n* Scheduled to have a major non-emergency surgery within approximately 8 weeks from the anticipated date of receiving the first rIX-FP injection.\n* Not previously completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study.\n* Male, 12 to 70 years of age.\n* Documented severe hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤ 2%), or confirmed at screening by the central laboratory.\n* Subjects who have received FIX products (plasma-derived and / or recombinant FIX) for \\> 150 exposure days (EDs), confirmed by their treating physician.\n* No confirmed history of FIX inhibitor formation at screening by the central laboratory\n\nFor previously untreated subjects:\n\n* Male, up to 18 years of age.\n* Documented severe hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤ 2%), or confirmed at screening by the central laboratory.\n* Never previously been treated with FIX clotting factor products (except previous exposure to blood components).\n* No confirmed history of FIX inhibitor formation\n\nSurgery substudy inclusion criterion:\n\n* Must require non-emergency surgery\n\nSubcutaneous substudy inclusion criteria:\n\n* Male, at least 18 years of age.\n* Subjects currently enrolled in Study CSL654\\_3003\n* Subjects who have received rIX-FP for ≥ 100 EDs (single-dose cohorts) or for ≥ 50 EDs (repeated-dose cohort)\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nMain study exclusion criteria:\n\n* Currently receiving a therapy not permitted during the study.\n* Any issue that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.\n\nFor subjects who have previously completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP study:\n\n* Unwilling to participate in the study for a total of 100 exposure days.\n\nFor subjects requiring major non-emergency surgery who have not previously completed a CSL-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study:\n\n* Known hypersensitivity (ie, allergic reaction or anaphylaxis) to any FIX product or hamster protein.\n* Known congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital FIX deficiency.\n* Currently receiving IV immunomodulating agents such as immunoglobulin or chronic systemic corticosteroid treatment.\n* Low platelet count, kidney or liver disease.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus positive with a CD4 count \\< 200/mm3.\n\nFor previously untreated subjects:\n\n* Known congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital FIX deficiency (except for vitamin K deficiency of the newborn).\n* Known kidney or liver dysfunction or any condition which, in the investigator's opinion, place the patient at unjustifiable risk.\n\nThe surgical substudy does not have any additional exclusion criteria, although subject(s) in France will not be eligible for the surgery sub-study.\n\nSubcutaneous substudy exclusion criteria:\n\n* Intravenous use of rIX-FP within 14 days of subcutaneous administration of rIX-FP.\n* Life-threatening bleeding episode or major surgery during the 3 months prior to substudy
