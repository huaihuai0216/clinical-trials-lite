Participants will get semaglutide (active medicine) or placebo ('dummy medicine'). This is known as participants' study medicine - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Semaglutide is a medicine, doctors can prescribe in some countries for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Participants will get the study medicine in a pen.
