The investigators plan to compare the treatment outcome (quality of life and survival) in tumor patients, receiving standard or \"add-on\" homeopathic treatment.\n\nThe null hypothesis is that \"add-on\" homeopathic treatment does not create a benefit for cancer patients. In addition the investigators evaluate survival time.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"EORTC-QLQ-C30 Score","timeFrame":"baseline and at 18 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Homeopathic Placebo Globules","deltaMin":51.2,"sd":28},{"arm":"Additive Classical Homeopathy in Cancer Patients","deltaMin":46.6,"sd":25.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.397"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Austria"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33010094"],"seeAlso":["http://www.homeopathicresearch.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":47},"commonTop":[]}}
