Subject is a male or female adult â‰¥ 18 years of age on the day the study informed consent form (ICF) is signed.\n  2. Subject has a documented candidiasis, including candidemia, caused by Candida auris. The subject is also eligible if he/she is receiving IV antifungal therapy for their C. auris infection and, in the judgment of the investigator, long-term IV antifungal therapy is not feasible or desirable due to clinical or logistical circumstances. A documented candidiasis, including candidemia, caused by Candida auris is defined as the recovery of Candida auris by culture of a sample obtained within the last 7 days.\n  3. Subject is able to tolerate medication orally or through a nasogastric (NG) tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* KEY exclusion criteria:\n\n  1. Subject has a fungal disease with central nervous system involvement.\n  2. Subject has a fungal disease of the bone and/or joint that is expected to require \\>90 days of study drug treatment.\n  3. Subject has an inappropriately controlled fungal infection source (e.g., persistent catheters, devices, identified abscess) that is likely the source of the fungal infection.\n  4. Subject is hemodynamically unstable and/or requiring vasopressor medication for blood pressure support.\n  5. Subject has abnormal liver test parameters: AST or ALT \\>10 x ULN, and/or total bilirubin \\>5 x ULN. Note: Subjects with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with diagnosis of Gilbert's disease are not excluded.\n  6. Subject has an Apache score \\>16.\n  7. Subject has serum creatinine \\>3 times from Baseline (Screening/Treatment Day 1) value.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Global Success at End of Treatment as Determined by the Data Monitoring Committee","description":"The percentage of participants with global success at End of Treatment (EoT) as determined by the Data Monitoring Committee.
