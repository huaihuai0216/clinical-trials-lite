SF-36v2™ (acute version) questionnaire measured eight domains of functional health and well-being as well as two component summary scores (physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS)). The 0-100 scale scores (where higher scores indicated a better HRQoL) from the SF-36 were converted to norm-based scores to enable a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 2009 U.S. general population. In the metric of norm-based scores, 50 and 10 corresponds to the mean and standard deviation respectively of the 2009 U.S. general population. Change from baseline (week 0) in the domain scores and component summary (PCS and MCS) scores were evaluated at weeks 26 and 52. A positive change score indicates an improvement since baseline. Results are based on the data from the in-trial observation period.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.18","spread":"3.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.08","spread":"4.04"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.06","spread":"4.16"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.24","spread":"3.71"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.37","spread":"3.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.70","spread":"4.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.02","spread":"4.27"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.61","spread":"5.01"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.58","spread":"5.12"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.59","spread":"5.49"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.01","spread":"6.00"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.48","spread":"5.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.92","spread":"5.66"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.05","spread":"6.13"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.92","spread":"7.26"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.28","spread":"5.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.88","spread":"8.39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.05","spread":"8.26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.99","spread":"9.32"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.44","spread":"7.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.72","spread":"9.74"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.27","spread":"8.88"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.01","spread":"9.48"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.24","spread":"5.77"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.42","spread":"4.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.09","spread":"5.26"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.71","spread":"5.94"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-1.03","spread":"5.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.34","spread":"5.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.01","spread":"5.27"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.59","spread":"6.13"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.97","spread":"6.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.62","spread":"7.49"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.79","spread":"7.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.83","spread":"6.84"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-1.40","spread":"7.94"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.90","spread":"7.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.11","spread":"7.03"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.09","spread":"6.83"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.86","spread":"7.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.77","spread":"5.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.15","spread":"5.95"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.15","spread":"6.08"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.15","spread":"4.98"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.98","spread":"8.10"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.42","spread":"6.80"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.12","spread":"5.92"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.08","spread":"6.73"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.54","spread":"7.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.42","spread":"6.96"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.16","spread":"6.60"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-1.01","spread":"6.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.02","spread":"7.70"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.59","spread":"6.89"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.05","spread":"8.16"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-1.21","spread":"7.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.03","spread":"6.54"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.16","spread":"6.66"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.41","spread":"7.32"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.27","spread":"7.34"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.64","spread":"7.63"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.35","spread":"6.68"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.27","spread":"7.58"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.31","spread":"10.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.17","spread":"4.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.14","spread":"4.27"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.23","spread":"5.24"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.57","spread":"4.80"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.88","spread":"4.73"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.19","spread":"4.91"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.03","spread":"5.34"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.24","spread":"4.52"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.13","spread":"6.54"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.07","spread":"5.85"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.71","spread":"5.91"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.42","spread":"6.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.52","spread":"7.26"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.19","spread":"6.31"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.23","spread":"6.15"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.74","spread":"8.57"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Diabetes

influence of diabetes treatment on health related-QoL on 4 domains on individual scale ranges: \"Burden on social activities and daily activities\", \"Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment\", \"Hypoglycemia\" and \"Satisfaction with treatment\" on a 7-point graded response scale. The domain score is calculated from the mean score of the attribute items, and the scoring range is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worst case response = 0). The total score, after simple addition of the item scores, is converted to 0 - 100 (best-case response = 100; worst case response = 0). Change from baseline (week 0) in the scores were evaluated at week 26, week 52. Data based on in-trial observation period is presented.
