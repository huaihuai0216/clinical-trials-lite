Age greater than or equal to 18 years.\n2. Patients with the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies or hematological disorders, who are immediately post- allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n3. Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. no hysterectomy, no loss of menses for 12 consecutive months), must be willing to use contraception.\n4. Negative pregnancy test in premenopausal patients.\n5. Patients with GVHD or infections can be entered only if they respond to treatment and become controlled.\n6. Dental considerations: patients with negative dental screening for jaw osteonecrosis 0-3 months prior to their transplant and patients that do not have a plan for tooth extraction in the near future.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with documented relapsed malignancy or recurrence of the original hematological disorder after the transplant, uncontrolled acute GVHD, or uncontrolled infection.\n2. Patients with hypocalcemia of less than 8.4 (corrected to account for the albumin level).\n3. Patients with hypercalcemia \\>12.2, due to a cause not related to their hematological malignancy or hematological disorder (i.e. hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma).\n4. Hypersensitivity to Ibandronate or other bisphosphonates.\n5. Pre-existing osteoporosis, defined as a bone density T-score of -2.5 S.D. or less.\n6. Renal insufficiency (calculated creatinine clearance \\< 30 ml/min).\n7. Patients already on bisphosphonates (over the past two years), calcitonin, anabolic steroids, or daily oral fluoride supplement.\n8. Myeloma patients who have previously been on bisphosphonates over the past two years and/or have active bone lesions.\n9. If corrected calcium is above 10.3 and the immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) is elevated or normal, the patient will be excluded from the study.\n10. Patients with a 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration \\<20 ng/ml and evidence of osteomalacia (low ionized calcium and elevated intact PTH).\n11. Dental considerations: Patients with recent tooth extraction with signs of incomplete healing or significant infection will be excluded.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage Change in Bone Mineral Density From Baseline to 6 and 12 Months","description":"The primary outcome measure was the percentage change in BMD in the lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip at 6 and 12 months (Â±4 weeks) after allo-SCT relative to baseline.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.06","spread":"4.03"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.61","spread":"4.2"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.63","spread":"4.18"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.85","spread":"5.37"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.73","spread":"3.88"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-4.72","spread":"4.32"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.27","spread":"5.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.81","spread":"4.49"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.29","spread":"5.71"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.2","spread":"5.25"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.85","spread":"5.47"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-5.68","spread":"5.15"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":39},"commonTop":["Other","Infection","Skin rash","GI GVHD","Cystitis"]}}}
