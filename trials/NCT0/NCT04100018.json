The participant's assessment of pain with BPI-SF Item number 3 (pain symptoms at their worst over the last 24 hours) form basis for analysis. Time to pain progression is time between date of randomization and date of first increase in worst pain intensity. Pain progression occurred if an increase in worst pain intensity of \\>= 2 points is observed from baseline and maintained over 2 consecutive time periods. Baseline was evaluations or events that occur before date and time of first dose of study treatment or evaluations on same date and time of first dose of study treatment were also considered as baseline.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.53","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12.42","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":256,"n":510},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Diarrhoea","Anaemia","Fatigue","Nausea"]}}}
