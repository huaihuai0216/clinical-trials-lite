Two fecal samples will be collected at each time-point assessment. The geometric mean based egg reduction rate (ERR) of T. trichiura egg counts will be assessed by Kato-Katz microscopy pre-treatment and 14-21 days post-treatment.\n\nThis trial will be conducted as a school-based study on Pemba Island (Zanzibar, Tanzania).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Egg Reduction Rate Against T.
