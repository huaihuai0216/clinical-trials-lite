OS will be measured as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, assessed for up to 52 months in this outcome measure.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"42.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"46.5","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Pharmacokinetic Parameter: Plasma Concentration of Ixazomib","description":"Plasma concentrations of the complete hydrolysis product of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib) were measured using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"Geometric Coefficient of Variation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.353","spread":"89.2568"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12.698","spread":"67.8350"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.683","spread":"162.3947"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.828","spread":"86.7699"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.958","spread":"170.8938"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.217","spread":"188.6379"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.252","spread":"56.2869"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.363","spread":"52.9781"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.328","spread":"53.0909"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.547","spread":"224.4312"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.503","spread":"52.9349"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.585","spread":"57.9514"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.606","spread":"58.5109"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.566","spread":"58.1094"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.686","spread":"50.2494"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to Resolution of Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) Events","description":"PN is defined as the event in the high-level term of peripheral neuropathies not elsewhere classified (NEC) according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA).
