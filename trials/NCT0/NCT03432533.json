Vitamin D repletion will be permitted a nd subjects may be rescreened\n* Current hyperthyroidism (unless well controlled on stable antithyroid therapy) by subject report or by chart review, per principal investigator evaluation\n* Current clinical hypothyroidism (unless well controlled on stable thyroid replacement therapy) by subject report or by chart review, per principal investigator evaluation normal range, per subject medical history. Uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism is defined as: parathyroid hormone (PTH) outside the normal range in subjects with concurrent hypercalcemia; or PTH values \\> 20% above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in normocalcemic subjects.\n* Current hyper- or hypocalcemia, defined as albumin-adjusted serum calcium outside the normal range, as assessed by the central laboratory.
