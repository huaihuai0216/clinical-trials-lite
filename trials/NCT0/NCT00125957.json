Although many people feel 'better', they do not feel completely 'well'. Often, individuals continue to complain of cognitive problems such as lack of attention, diminished motivation, and impaired problem-solving. This study looks at whether residual and cognitive symptoms of depression in individuals are affected by the addition of Wellbutrin (bupropion).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)","timeFrame":"Baseline and follow-up","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Wellbutrin First, Then Placebo","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo First, Then Wellbutrin","deltaMin":18,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":".04"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.mclean.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":15},"commonTop":[]}}
