Subjects who test positive and can produce a prescription for the medication from their physician may be considered for study enrolment at the discretion of the Investigator.\n* Has a history of a clinically significant (Investigator opinion) gastrointestinal (GI) event within 6 months before screening or has any history of peptic or gastric ulcers or GI bleeding.\n* Has a surgical or medical condition of the GI or renal system that might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, or excretion of any drug substance.\n* Is considered by the Investigator, for any reason to be an unsuitable candidate to receive the study drug.\n* Is receiving systemic chemotherapy, has an active malignancy of any type, or has been diagnosed with cancer within 5 years before Screening (excluding treated squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin).\n* Is currently receiving anticoagulants (e.g. heparin or warfarin).\n* Has received a course of systemic corticosteroids (either oral or parenteral) within 3 months before screening (inhaled nasal steroids and regional/limited area application of topical corticosteroids (Investigator discretion) are allowed).\n* Has a history of chronic use (defined as daily use for \\> 2 weeks) of NSAIDs, opiates, or glucocorticoids (except inhaled nasal steroids and regional/limited topical corticosteroids), for any condition within 6 months before study drug administration. Aspirin at a daily dose of ≤ 325 mg is allowed for cardiovascular prophylaxis if the subject has been on a stable dose regimen for ≥ 30 days before screening and has not experienced any relevant medical problem.\n* Has a significant renal or hepatic disease, as indicated by clinical laboratory assessment (results ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\] for any liver function test, including aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\], alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\], or creatinine ≥ 1.5 times the ULN).\n* Has any clinically significant laboratory finding at screening that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates study participation.\n* Previously participated in another clinical study of Maxigesic® IV or received any investigational drug or device or investigational therapy within 30 days before Screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
