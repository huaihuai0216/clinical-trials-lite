Prior moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy: Patients may have previously received a mildly emetogenic agent (such as a taxane) if no nausea/vomiting was experienced with that chemotherapy\n5. Scheduled to receive cranial, abdominal, or pelvic radiation therapy during the study period\n6. Treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days of randomization\n7. Scheduled to receive treatment during the study period with other potential or known antiemetic agents. Chronically used benzodiazepines may be continued as a single nightly dose for sleep.\n8.
