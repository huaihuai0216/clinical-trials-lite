The study is open to people who take insulin but still have too high blood sugar levels. Participants may additionally be taking up to 2 other medicines for their diabetes. The purpose of this study is to find out whether empagliflozin taken together with insulin helps people with type 2 diabetes to better control their blood sugar.\n\nThe participants are in the study for about 7 months. During this time, they visit the study site about 8 times, 1 additional visit may be either a visit to the study site or a phone call. At the start of the study, participants are put into 3 groups by chance. Participants get either 10 mg empagliflozin tablets, or 25 mg empagliflozin tablets, or placebo tablets once a day. Placebo tablets look like empagliflozin tablets but do not contain any medicine.\n\nThe doctors regularly take blood samples from the participants. The changes in blood sugar levels are compared between the groups. The doctors also check the general health of the participants.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 24","timeFrame":"At baseline (Week 0) and at Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.13,"sd":0.1},{"arm":"Empagliflozin 10 mg","deltaMin":-1.12,"sd":0.1},{"arm":"Empagliflozin 25 mg","deltaMin":-1.12,"sd":0.1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":24,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.mystudywindow.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":73},"commonTop":["Hypoglycaemia","Urinary tract infection","Protein urine present","Diabetic nephropathy","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
