Traditional treatment involves surgery followed by six weeks of daily radiation therapy. This study investigates a less intense radiation treatment following surgery that uses half the dose of radiation given over two weeks rather than six weeks. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive the less intense treatment versus the traditional treatment by coin flip. Patients are twice as likely to receive the less intense treatment during randomization.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Grade 3+ Adverse Events Rate","timeFrame":"2 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"De-escalated Adjuvant Radiation Therapy (DART)","deltaMin":0.032,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard of Care Treatment (SOC)","deltaMin":0.115,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40907518","40402484"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":136},"commonTop":["Dry mouth","Fatigue","Dysgeusia","Dysphagia","Dermatitis radiation"]}}
