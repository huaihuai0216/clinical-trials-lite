Each AE-QoL question had 5 answer options (scored 1-5), with lower and higher scores indicting less and more adverse impact, respectively. Per-subject scores for each domain were computed using the appropriate scoring algorithm applied to the question response scores for each domain. Per-subject total scores (including all 4 domains) were similarly computed using the question response scores for all 17 questions. The outputs from the scoring algorithm were normalized on a scale ranging from 0 (less adverse impact) to 100 (most adverse impact).
