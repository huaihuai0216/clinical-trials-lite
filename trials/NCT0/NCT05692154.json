Mild asthmatics treated only with pro re nata short-acting β2agonists, less than 2 doses per week can be enrolled.\n* History of chronic sinusitis, defined as a sinus symptoms lasting greater than 12 weeks that includes 2 or more major factors or 1 major factor and 2 minor factors. Major factors are defined as facial pain or pressure, nasal obstruction or blockage, nasal discharge or purulence or discolored postnasal discharge, purulence in nasal cavity, or impaired or loss of smell. Minor factors are defined as headache, fever, halitosis, fatigue, dental pain, cough, and ear pain, pressure, or fullness.\n* History of systemic disease affecting the immune system such as autoimmune diseases, immune complex disease, or immunodeficiency, where, in the opinion of the study physician, participation in the trial would pose a risk or significant effect on the immune system.\n* Presence or history of drug hypersensitivity to fexofenadine and/or its excipients.\n* Participants unable to stop the following forbidden treatments/nutriments prior to pollen challenge:\n\n  * Antihistamines: within 3 days for first-generation antihistamines, within 2 days for second-generation antihistamines.\n  * Intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids: 7 days.\n  * Ocular, intranasal, or inhaled sodium cromoglycate: 14 days.\n  * High doses of systemic corticosteroids: 30 days.\n  * Leukotriene antagonists: 30 days.\n  * Intranasal or systemic decongestants: 3 days.\n  * Tricyclic antidepressants: 7 days.\n  * Any citrus fruits (grapefruit, orange, etc.) or their juices, as well as all fruit juices: 5 days.\n  * Aluminum-and-magnesium containing antacids: 7 days.\n  * Omalizumab/dupilumab: within 6 months\n* Any contraindications to fexofenadine, according to the labeling.\n* The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a potential participation in a clinical trial.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"80 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Total Nasal Symptoms Score (TNSS-3)","description":"TNSS-3=composite score calculated as sum of rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching scores (TNSS-3: scale of each symptom is scored from 0 to 3), where 0 indicates no symptoms, a score of 1 for mild symptoms that are easily tolerated, 2 for awareness of symptoms which are bothersome but tolerable and 3 is reserved for severe symptoms that are hard to tolerate and interfere with daily activity.
