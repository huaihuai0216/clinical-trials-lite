Male and female patients 12 years of age and older\n2. Provide written informed consent/pediatric assent. If the patient is a minor, a parent or legal guardian must give written informed consent\n3. Screening Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS of at least 8 out of a possible 12 and a congestion score of 2 or 3 on Day -7\n4. Randomization Visit: Have a 12-hour reflective TNSS (AM or PM) of at least 8 on 3 separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of Day 1, and can include the morning of Day 1) during the Lead-in Period. In addition, an AM or PM 12-hour reflective nasal congestion score of 2 or 3 must have been recorded on 3 separate symptom assessments (one of which was within 2 days of Day 1, and can include the morning of Day 1)\n5. Randomization Visit: An instantaneous TNSS of ≥ 8 before beginning the onset of action assessment on Day 1\n6. Must have taken at least 10 doses of study medication during the lead-in period\n7. Willing and able to comply with the study requirements\n8. At least a 2-year history of SAR\n9. The presence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to ragweed antigen or other local fall allergens, confirmed by a positive response to either skin prick within the last year. A positive response is defined as a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the negative control for the skin prick test.\n10. General good health and free of any disease or concomitant treatment that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results as determined by the investigator or the sponsor's medical officer. When in doubt, the investigator should confer with the sponsor's medical monitor or designee to determine eligibility for the study.\n11. Patients receiving immunotherapy injections (antigen desensitization) must be on a stable maintenance regimen for at least 30 days before the first study visit (adjustments to regimen following a brief period of missed injections does not preclude participation). Patients currently receiving sublingual immunotherapy are excluded. A 6-month washout period is required following the last dose of sublingual immunotherapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. On Focused Nasal Examination, the presence of any nasal mucosal erosion, nasal ulceration, or nasal septal perforation at either the screening visit or randomization visit will disqualify the patient from the study.\n2. Other nasal disease(s) likely such as sinusitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, clinically significant polyposis, or nasal structural abnormalities.\n3. Nasal surgery or sinus surgery within the previous year.\n4. Chronic sinusitis - more than 3 episodes per year\n5. Planned travel outside of the study area during the study period\n6. The use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to Day -7. No investigational products are permitted for use during the conduct of this study\n7. Presence of any hypersensitivity to drugs similar to azelastine and to either sorbitol or sucralose (Splenda® brand sweetener)\n8. Women who are pregnant or nursing\n9. Women of childbearing potential who are not abstinent or not practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception\n10. Respiratory Tract Infections within 14 days prior to Day -7\n11. Respiratory Tract Infections requiring oral antibiotic within 14 days of Day -7\n12. Asthma (with the exception of mild, intermittent asthma). Patients with mild, intermittent asthma who only require short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are eligible for enrollment.\n13. Significant pulmonary disease including COPD\n14. Clinically significant arrhythmia or with symptomatic cardiac conditions\n15. A known history of alcohol or drug abuse\n16. Existence of any surgical or medical condition or physical or laboratory findings, which in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor's medical monitor, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug or that might significantly affect the patient's ability to complete this trial.\n17. Clinically relevant abnormal physical findings within 1 week of randomization which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the objectives of the study or that may preclude compliance with the study procedures\n18. Participation in MedPointe Protocols MP433, MP434, MP435, or MP436.\n19. Employees of the research center or private practice and their family members are excluded\n20. Patients who received prohibited medications within specified timepoints in the protocol.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in 12-hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score(rTNSS)for the Entire 14-day Study Period Compared to Placebo","description":"rTNSS consisting of runny nose, itchy nose, nasal congestion, and sneezing was assessed twice daily.
