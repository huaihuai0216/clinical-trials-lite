Subjects will be randomized to receive 150 mg of GSK2118436 twice daily or 1000 mg/m2 DTIC every 3 weeks and continue on treatment until disease progression, death, or unacceptable adverse event. Subjects who progress on DTIC will be allowed to crossover to an optional extension arm of the study to receive GSK2118436.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator","timeFrame":"Time interval between the date of randomization and the earlier of the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause (up to 9.9 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GSK2118436 150 mg BID","deltaMin":6.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"DTIC 1000 mg/m^2 in RP","deltaMin":2.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":94,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","France","Germany","Hungary","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22735384","31864178","26446943","26040620","24769640","24408395"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":64,"n":187},"commonTop":["Nausea","Arthralgia","Hyperkeratosis","Headache","Pyrexia"]}}
