This will be a placebo-controlled trial. 3 out of 4 patients will receive an injection of VEGF Trap-Eye into the affected eye (and repeated injections if required), and 1 out of 4 patients will receive a sham injection requiring no needle stick, but making the patient unaware of whether or not he received active treatment.\n\nOutcome of the two treatment groups will be compared after 24 weeks. From week 24, sham patients may receive active treatment.\n\nTotal duration of the study will be 48 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) as Measured by Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) From Baseline to Week 24 - Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Aflibercept Injection First, Then Aflibercept or Sham","deltaMin":12.1,"sd":8.3},{"arm":"Sham Treatment First, Then Aflibercept Injection or Sham","deltaMin":-2,"sd":9.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":28},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["Hong Kong","Japan","Singapore","South Korea","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":91},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Conjunctival haemorrhage","Punctate keratitis","Eye pain","Dry eye"]}}
