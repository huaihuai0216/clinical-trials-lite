Repeat of Visit 101 spirometry should be done in an ad-hoc visit to be scheduled on a date that would provide sufficient time to receive confirmation from the spirometry data central reviewer of the validity of the assessment before randomization. Run-in medication should be dispensed once spirometry assessment met inclusion criteria (ATS/ERS quality criteria, FEV1 % predicted normal value, and reversibility) as per equipment\n* A one-time rescreen is allowed in case the patient fails to meet the criteria at the repeat, provided the patient returned to the required treatment as per inclusion criteria 4\n* Patients who demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of 12% and 200 mL within 30 minutes after administration of 400 µg salbutamol/360 µg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at Visit 101.All patients must perform a reversibility test at Visit 101. If reversibility is not demonstrated at Visit 101 then one of the following criteria need to be met.\n* Reversibility should be repeated once.\n* Patients may be permitted to enter the study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines within 2 years prior to Visit 1.\n* Alternatively, patients may be permitted to enter the study with a historical positive bronchoprovocation test that was performed within 2 years prior to Visit 1.

Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation as defined by continuous atrial fibrillation for at least 6 months and controlled with a rate control strategy (i.e., selective beta blockers, calcium channel blocker, pacemaker placement, digoxin or ablation therapy) for at least 6 months may be considered for inclusion.
