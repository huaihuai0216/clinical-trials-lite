Clinically significant illness (other than HCV) or any other major medical disorder that may interfere with the participant treatment, assessment or compliance with the protocol; participants currently under evaluation for a potentially clinically significant illness (other than HCV) are also excluded.\n   2. Clinical hepatic decompensation (i.e. ascites, encephalopathy or variceal haemorrhage).\n   3. Solid organ transplant.\n   4. History of severe, life-threatening or other significant sensitivity to any excipients of the study drugs.\n2. Any of the following lab parameters at screening:\n\n   1. ALT \\> 10 x ULN\n   2. AST \\> 10 x ULN\n   3. Direct bilirubin \\> ULN\n   4. Platelets \\< 90,000/μL (cells/mm3) if Fibroscan® \\<12.5 kPa OR \\< 150,000/μL (cells/mm3) if Fibroscan® is unavailable and patient is included with APRI \\<1\n   5. Creatinine clearance (CLcr) \\< 50 mL/min\n   6. Haemoglobin \\< 12g/dL for males; \\<11g/dL for females\n   7. Albumin \\< LLN\n   8. INR \\> 1.5 ULN unless subject has known haemophilia or is stable on an anticoagulant regimen affecting INR\n3. Pregnant or breastfeeding female.\n4. HBV infection (HBsAg positive).\n5. Use of prohibited concomitant medications as described in protocol section 5.2.\n6. Chronic use of systemically administered immunosuppressive agents (e.g. prednisone equivalent \\> 10 mg/day for \\>2 weeks).\n7. Therapy with any anti-neoplastic or immunomodulatory treatment (including supraphysiologic doses of steroids and radiation) ≤6 months prior to the first dose of study drug.\n8. Any investigational drug ≤6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.\n9. Ongoing severe psychiatric disease as judged by the treating physician.\n10. Positive result of a urine drug screen at the Screening Visit for opiates, barbiturates, amphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepines, phencyclidine, propoxyphene, or alcohol, with the exception of a positive result (including methadone) associated with documented short-term use or chronic stable use of a prescribed medication in that class.\n11. Injecting drug use within the previous six months.\n12. Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or abide by the requirements of the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Undetectable HCV RNA (ITT Population)","description":"Number of participants with undetectable HCV RNA based on ITT population.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"121","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"233","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Undetectable HCV RNA (mITT Population)","description":"Number of participants with undetectable HCV RNA based on mITT population.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"121","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"233","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Treatment and Study Visits Adherence","description":"Number adherent to treatment and study visits (on-treatment adherence and early treatment discontinuation).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"125","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"241","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Health-related Quality of Life","description":"Change in health-related quality of life score pre and post-treatment (measured by EQ-5D-3L).
