Serum creatinine results obtained within 5 days prior to Baseline are acceptable.\n\nInclusion criteria at Randomization:\n\n* Effective tacrolimus minimization, confirmed by stable blood trough levels in the two months prior to randomization, i.e. verification of last two tacrolimus blood trough level ≤ 5 ng/mL in the two months prior to randomization. Investigators should make adjustments in tacrolimus dosing to continue to target trough levels ≤ 5 ng/mL prior to randomization.\n* Abbreviated MDRD-4 eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Serum creatinine results obtained within 5 days prior to Visit 5 are acceptable.\n\nExclusion criteria at Baseline:\n\n* Patients who are recipients of multiple solid organ transplants, (e.g., multivisceral or combined liver-kidney transplants), or have previously received an organ or tissue transplanted, or who received an AB0 incompatible transplant.\n* Patients who experienced more than one episode of treated biopsy proven acute rejection (BANFF ≥ 3 or RAI ≥ 7) or one steroid-resistant acute rejection.\n* Patients who require renal replacement therapy.\n* Patients with a confirmed spot urine protein/creatinine ratio that indicates ≥1.0 g/24 hrs of proteinuria.\n* History of malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, other than non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or HCC.\n\nExclusion criteria at Randomization:\n\n* Patients who experienced more than two episodes of treated biopsy proven acute rejection (BANFF ≥ 3 or RAI ≥ 7) since transplantation or one steroid-resistant acute rejection during the run-in period.\n* Patients with a confirmed spot urine protein/creatinine ratio that indicates ≥ 3.0 g/24 hrs of proteinuria.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Renal Function Assessed by Estimated Glomerular Filtartion Rate (eGFR)","description":"Renal function was assessed by eGFR using the MDRD-4 formula at 12 months after transplant:\n\neGFR = 186.3 \\* (serum creatinine)-1.154 \\* age-0.203 \\* (0.742 for women) \\* (1.21 if African American) where serum creatinine was in mg/dL and age in years.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"85.50","spread":"3.97"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"80.26","spread":"3.87"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Treated Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (tBPAR) Acute Rejection (AR), Graft Loss (GL) or Death (D)","description":"Participants were assessed for tBPAR, AR, GL or death.
