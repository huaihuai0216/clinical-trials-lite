Approximately 794 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: albiglutide + insulin glargine (with insulin lispro discontinuation at Week 4) (with or without metformin) or to intensification of insulin glargine + insulin lispro (with or without metformin). The study will comprise 4 study periods : Screening (2 weeks), Standardization (4 weeks), Treatment (26 weeks), and Post treatment Follow up (4 weeks). The total duration of a subject's participation will be approximately 36 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline (Day -1) and Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Albiglutide + Insulin Glargine","deltaMin":-1.04,"sd":0.041},{"arm":"Insulin Lispro + Insulin Glargine","deltaMin":-1.1,"sd":0.04}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":13,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":157,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Canada","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Philippines","Poland","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32694215"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":400},"commonTop":["Influenza","Viral upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Urinary tract infection","Nausea"]}}
