The study will consist of one screening/baseline visit, one visit during treatment with active drug, and one visit on placebo. After the baseline visit, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study medication or placebo for the first three weeks, followed by a two week wash-out, and then treatment reallocation for the latter three weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Efficacy of Dalfampridine on Visual Function by Early Diabetic Treatment Retinopathy Study (EDTRS) 5% Contrast Sensitivity Scores","timeFrame":"Visit 1 (Week 0), Visit 2 (Week 3) and Visit 3 (Week 8)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group B: Dalfampridine","deltaMin":-0.04,"sd":0.02},{"arm":"Group B: Placebo","deltaMin":-0.06,"sd":0.02},{"arm":"Group A: Placebo","deltaMin":-0.08,"sd":0.02},{"arm":"Group A: Dalfampridine","deltaMin":-0.06,"sd":0.02}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.84"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":".29"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15664543","15953446","16554529","11992867","16935592","19240050","1734247","9400788","9093956","19249634","9700711","9109861","7755367","8208399","8129642","8336169","1510353","1891078","2082971","2317014","16283615","6631441","19922891","19922892","6477856","8610798","19307541","19564583","20498438","20498437","19073948","19667226","9373488"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":46},"commonTop":["Dizziness"]}}
