Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not known if giving gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin with or without nab-paclitaxel may work better at treating biliary tract cancers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to 3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Gem+Cisplatin+Nab-paclitaxel","deltaMin":14,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gemcitabine + Cisplatin","deltaMin":13.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.41"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":23,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":692,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["39671534"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":27,"n":287},"commonTop":["Anemia","Fatigue","Nausea","Neutrophil count decreased","Constipation"]}}
