Histologic confirmation of cancer will be required by biopsy or cytology within 6 months of study entry.\n* Patients must have the potential for benefit from local therapy (at the discretion of the investigator).\n* The patient's Zubrod performance status must be 2 or greater OR patients with Zubrod performance status 0-1 and weight loss \\>10% are considered eligible. In addition, patients determined to be medically unfit or refusing combined modality therapy are eligible.\n* Age â‰¥ 18.\n* Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.\n* Women of childbearing potential and male participants must agree to use an effective method of contraception.\n* Patients must sign study specific informed consent prior to study entry.\n* Patients must not have plans for concurrent chemoradiation therapy.\n* Patients must complete all required pretreatment evaluations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Total (aggregate) gross tumor volume \\> 500 cm3 (500 cc's or 0.5 Liters)\n* Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in direct overlap of radiation therapy fields.\n* Chemotherapy given within one week of study registration.\n* Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment involves unforeseeable risks to the embryo or fetus.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"99 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Survival of Standard Radiation (CFRT) Versus Accelerated, Hypofractionated, Image-guided Conformal Radiotherapy (IGRT) in Treatment of Stage II-III NSCLC in Patients With Poor Performance Status at 1 Year.","description":"Percentage of participants with overall survival at 1 year. To compare the efficacy by overall survival of standard radiation versus accelerated, hypofractionated, image-guided conformal radiotherapy in treatment of stage II-III or recurrent NSCLC in patients with poor performance status.

The Cox proportional hazard regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment difference in overall survival. Unadjusted ratios and ratios adjusted for stratification variables and other covariates of interest will be computed.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Toxicities of Two Radiotherapy Treatment Regimens in Patients With Stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Poor Performance Status","description":"To compare toxicity of two radiotherapy treatment regimens in patient with stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and poor performance status.
