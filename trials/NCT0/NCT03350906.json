Subjects then performed a series of single repetition attempts at increasing workloads, each separated by 3 min of rest, until the maximum load that could be moved through the entire range of motion was reached. This maximum workload was defined as the individual 1-RM.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.5","spread":"14.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.1","spread":"14.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Body Mass Index (BMI)","description":"Subject's BMI calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
