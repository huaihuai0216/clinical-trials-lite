History of major gastric, hepatic, pancreatic or intestinal surgery (appendectomy, hemorrhoidectomy, or polypectomy allowed as long as occurred \\> 3 months prior to trial screening; uncomplicated laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy is allowed if no history of post-operative biliary tract pain and surgery occurred \\> 3 months prior to screening);\n6. Significant and progressive enlargement of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes; ascites; palpable tumor formation in the abdominal cavity / pelvis according to physical examination, hepatic cirrhosis;\n7. Significant concomitant acute or chronic disease (cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunological, metabolic, bronchopulmonary, urinary system) or any condition that, according to Investigator, is a contraindication for the patient to participate in the study if interference with the study performance;\n8. Any inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, any infection including bacterial, viral, protozoa, helminthosis);\n9. Elevated fecal calprotectin level 1 month before or at screening which indicates the presence of inflammatory GIT disease;\n10. Unexplained GI bleeding within 3 months prior to screening;\n11. Confirmed diagnosis of bile acids malabsorption;\n12. History of any malignant disease except basal cell carcinoma of skin and vesical cervix carcinoma in situ which were cured â‰¥ 5 years ago;\n13. Confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease;\n14. Confirmed hereditary galactose or fructose intolerance , total lactase deficiency, sucrase-isomaltose insufficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption syndrome;\n15.

Inability to read or right; unwillingness to understand and comply with Protocol procedures; non-compliance with medication dosing regimen or procedures which, in the Investigator's opinion, may affect study results or the patient's safety and prevent the patient's participation in the study; any other concomitant diseases or severe mental disorders, which make the patient ineligible for study participation, limit the legal basis for Informed Consent procedure, or may affect the patient's ability to participate in the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline of Sum of NRS-11 Abdominal Pain and Bloating/Flatulence Intensity Scores After 4 Weeks of Treatment.","description":"The baseline abdominal pain and bloating/flatulence intensity was determined as the average of the Numeric rating scale (NRS-11) daily assessment during 7 days before randomization.\n\nThe Week 4 assessment was the average from last 7 days of the corresponding week.\n\nThe scale is a horizontal 10 cm line with the numbers from 0 to 10 located on it, where 0 is \"no pain/bloating\", 10 is \"most severe pain/bloating you can imagine\".","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-7.23","spread":"3.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-6.48","spread":"3.48"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-5.86","spread":"3.72"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline of NRS-11 Pain Intensity After 4 Weeks of Treatment","description":"The baseline pain intensity was determined as the average of the Numeric rating scale (NRS-11) daily assessment during 7 days before randomization.
