Each number on the scale is accompanied by a visual facial expression that indicates the level of pain, discomfort, and distress appropriate to the number on the scale. The more severe the level of pain, the higher the corresponding number and more distressing the accompanying facial expression. A VAS score of 0 indicates no active pain level and is accompanied by a pleasantly smiling face whereas a VAS score of 10 indicates the most severe active pain level and is accompanied by a visibly-distraught face that is frowning, grimacing, and sweating. The combination of facial expressions and numbers is supposed to provide a language-independent, validated means of assessing pain levels.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.05","spread":"2.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.03","spread":"3.50"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.49","spread":"1.92"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.60","spread":"1.85"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.64","spread":"2.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.22","spread":"1.81"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.72","spread":"1.91"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.08","spread":"1.85"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":39},"commonTop":[]}}}
