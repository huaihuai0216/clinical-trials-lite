Participants with FL will be given 1400 mg rituximab SC during induction therapy (once monthly for 4-7 cycles) and maintenance therapy (once every 2 months for 6-12 cycles). 1400 mg SC of rituximab will be given to participants with DLBCL once monthly for 4-7 cycles. Treatment duration is expected to last up to 7 months for participants with DLBCL and up to 32 months for participants with FL.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Administration-Associated Reactions (AARs)","timeFrame":"From start of treatment to end of treatment (up to 32 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)","deltaMin":34.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Follicular Lymphoma (FL)","deltaMin":52.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Subcutaneous Rituximab","deltaMin":48.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35126524","31573078"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":42,"n":140},"commonTop":["Erythema","Asthenia","Neutropenia","Respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea"]}}
