Definitive deterioration by at least 5% is defined as a decrease in score by at least 5% compared to baseline, with no later observed increase above this threshold. The EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) is an integrated system for assessing the healthrelated quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients participating in international clinical trials. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.45","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Pharmacokinetics Assessments - Cmin","description":"Cmin is the pre-dose blood concentration at steady-state (ng/mL).
