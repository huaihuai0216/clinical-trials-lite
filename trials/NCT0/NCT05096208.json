Unstable chronic medical condition or disease requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease within 3 months before receipt of study intervention.\n4. Immunocompromised individuals with known or suspected immunodeficiency, as determined by history and/or laboratory/physical examination.\n5. Known infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV.\n6. Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of study participation or, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for the study.\n7. Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational RSV vaccine at any time prior to enrollment or planned receipt throughout the study.\n8. Receipt of any blood/plasma products or immunoglobulin, from 60 days before study intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study.\n9. Receipt of monoclonal antibodies from 60 days before study intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study.\n10. Receipt of systemic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications within 60 days before study intervention administration or the use of systemic corticosteroids (≥20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for ≥14 days within 28 days prior to study enrollment. Prednisone use of \\<20 mg/day for \\<14 days is permitted. Inhaled/nebulized, intra-articular, intrabursal, or topical (skin, eyes, ears) corticosteroids are permitted.\n11. Current alcohol abuse or illicit drug use. Note: Marijuana use is not considered an exclusion criterion for the study when elicited in participant screening, though it may be considered illicit in some locales.\n12. Current use of any prohibited concomitant medication(s) or those unwilling/unable to use a permitted concomitant medication(s).\n13. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) or investigational vaccines within 28 days prior to consent and/or during study participation.\n14. Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; and women of child bearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in the protocol for the duration of the study.\n15.
