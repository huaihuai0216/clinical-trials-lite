The aim is to look at how N8-GP works during regular use. Participants will get N8-GP. N8-GP has been tested in more than 200 people with haemophilia A for several years. Participants will get an injection of N8-GP into a blood vessel, one, two or three times weekly. Participants will get more doses if they bleed or if they will need a surgery. The study will last for about 2 years. Participants will have at least 9 visits with the study doctor. If participants agree to be in this study, they will get their first injection (in this study) at the first visit. Participants will also get an injection at visit 3, 5 and 7. Participants will be trained to give all other injections themselves. Participants must not use any clotting factors other than N8-GP or any anticoagulants (blood thinners) during the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Adverse Events Reported","timeFrame":"Week 0 to week 108","effectByArm":[{"arm":"N8-GP, Once Weekly","deltaMin":58,"sd":null},{"arm":"N8-GP, Twice Weekly","deltaMin":444,"sd":null},{"arm":"N8-GP, Three Times Weekly","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":67,"countries":["United States","Australia","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Denmark","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Lithuania","Malaysia","Netherlands","Norway","Portugal","Puerto Rico","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":25},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Arthralgia","Headache","Influenza"]}}
