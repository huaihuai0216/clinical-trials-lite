biochemistry parameters were performed at local laboratories. Laboratory toxicities were defined based on NCI-CTC v4.0 from Grades 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe). Some laboratory parameters are bi-dimensional (i.e. can be graded in both the low and high direction). These parameters were split and presented in both directions. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing measurement taken prior to the first dose of study treatment (including unscheduled assessments). Values from all visits, including unscheduled visits, were included in the derivation of the worst post-baseline grade.

tests for biochemistry parameters were performed at local laboratories. Laboratory toxicities were defined based on local laboratory normal ranges (for parameters with NCI-CTC grade not defined). Some laboratory parameters are bi-dimensional (i.e. can be graded in both the low and high direction). These parameters were split and presented in both directions. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing measurement taken prior to the first dose of study treatment (including unscheduled assessments). Values from all visits, including unscheduled visits, were included in the derivation of the worst post-baseline grade. Not every abnormal laboratory value qualified as an adverse event, only if it met any of the following criteria: was clinically significant (per investigator); was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment; or resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant
