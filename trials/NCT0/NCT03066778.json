In this study, RECIST 1.1 has been modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.\n\nWith protocol Amendment 07 (03-Oct-2018), the outcome measure of \"Change from Baseline at Weeks 12 and 24 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale\" was replaced with a single time point analysis at Week 18.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 30.5 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab+EP","deltaMin":4.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo+EP","deltaMin":4.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.00069"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":26},"locations":{"siteCount":148,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Chile","France","Germany","Hungary","Ireland","Israel","Japan","New Zealand","Poland","Russia","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32468956"],"seeAlso":["http://merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":111,"n":223},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Anaemia","Nausea","Alopecia","Constipation"]}}
