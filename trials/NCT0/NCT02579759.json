Patient who can/agrees to stop these medications 4 weeks before randomization and during the whole study duration can be included;\n* Female of childbearing potential (apart of patient using adequate contraceptive measures), pregnant or breast feeding;\n* Known hypersensitivity to any of the individual components of PXT3003;\n* Porphyria as it is a contra indication to baclofen, and it may also induce neuropathy;\n* Suspected inability to complete the study follow-up (foreign workers, transient visitors, tourists or any others for whom follow-up evaluation is not assured);\n* Limited mental capacity or psychiatric disease rendering the subject unable to provide written informed consent or comply with evaluation procedures;\n* Patient who has participated in another trial of investigational drug(s) within the past 30 days;\n* If a patient from the same family, living in the same household, has already been included in this study, it will not be possible to include another patient from the same family to avoid mixing of therapeutic units; therefore there would be a risk of inversion of the blind treatments which could jeopardize the interpretation of study results.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS) Total Score","description":"The primary efficacy variable used in the main analysis is the mean of the available ONLS values at month 12 and month 15.\n\nThe ONLS is a disability scale that was derived and improved from the Overall Disability Sum Score (ODSS) to measure limitations in the everyday activities of the upper limbs (rated on 5 points) and the lower limbs (rated on 7 points).
