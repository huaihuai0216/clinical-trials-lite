Researchers also want to learn about the remission rates (rates of recovery) in patients with cancer who have received treatment with epoetin alfa. The safety and effectiveness of this therapy will also be studied.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Median Number of Participant Transfusions Required During 12 Weeks of Treatment","timeFrame":"12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Procrit Arm","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"No Procrit: Standard Arm","deltaMin":7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://mdanderson.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":25},"commonTop":[]}}
