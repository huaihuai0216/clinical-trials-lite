The CGAOtm software is designed to assist physicians and nurses in achieving tight glucose control (defined by a target for blood glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/dl) in critically ill patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"All-cause 90-day Mortality","timeFrame":"Day 90","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CGAO-based Glucose Control","deltaMin":431,"sd":null},{"arm":"Standard-Care Glucose Gontrol","deltaMin":447,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":35,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19500942","18183643","25888011","24420499"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":20,"n":1336},"commonTop":[]}}
