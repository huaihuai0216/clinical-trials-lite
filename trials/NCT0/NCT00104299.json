ANCA-associated vasculitis includes Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Rituximab is a man-made antibody used to treat certain types of cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients with WG and MPA.\n\nStudy hypothesis: Rituximab is not inferior to conventional therapy in its ability to induce disease remission by Month 6.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Disease Remission","timeFrame":"6 months post-randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab","deltaMin":63,"sd":null},{"arm":"Control Group","deltaMin":52,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23902488","20647199","23902481","23754238","22975753","26387933","25776953","25047592","34618687","31216123","27696762","26621483"],"seeAlso":["https://www.niaid.nih.gov/","https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/dait","http://www.immunetolerance.org","https://www.gene.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":60,"n":99},"commonTop":["Arthralgia","Nausea","Fatigue","Cough","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
