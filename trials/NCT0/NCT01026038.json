In this study, participants will receive an additional dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate persistence, if any, of the antibody response by measuring any remaining pneumococcal antibodies since the previous study. This study will also evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered at least 24 months after the last dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Serotype-specific Pneumococcal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) 1 Month After Single Dose of 13 Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate (13vPnC) Vaccine","timeFrame":"One month after vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"13vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC","deltaMin":10.34,"sd":null},{"arm":"7vPnC/7vPnC/13vPnC","deltaMin":12.79,"sd":null},{"arm":"7vPnC/13vPnC/13vPnC","deltaMin":8.98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"3 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":25,"countries":["France"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=6096A1-3021&StudyName=Study%20Evaluating%20Antibody%20Response%20Of%2013-Valent%20Pneumococcal%20Conjugate%20Vaccine%20%2813vPnC%29%2024%20months%20after%20toddler%20dose."]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":130},"commonTop":["Pain (Any)","Pain (Mild)","Redness (Any)","Fatigue (Any)","Redness (Mild)"]}}
