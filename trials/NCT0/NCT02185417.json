The investigators incorporated the pragmatic methods used by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System to provide a real-world assessment of the effectiveness of chlorthalidone as compared with hydrochlorothiazide in routine clinical care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time From Randomization to Composite Primary Outcome","timeFrame":"Outcome data collection was performed from study randomization until the participants deceased, withdrawn, or reached end of study (Up to 5.4 years for the first patient enrolled and an average of 2.4 years for all participants).","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hydrochlorothiazide","deltaMin":1.5,"sd":1},{"arm":"Chlorthalidone","deltaMin":1.5,"sd":1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.45"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":70,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35390512","36992530","36516076","37656456","40269774","39656458","38743423","37244366","37137378","37031794"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1977,"n":6767},"commonTop":["Hospitalization for acute kidney injury","Hyponatremia","Hypokalemia","New onset of diabetes","Acute gout episode"]}}
