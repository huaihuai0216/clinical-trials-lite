Eosinophilia is central to the pathophysiology of EGPA and interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine regulating the life-cycle of the eosinophil. Neutralization of IL-5 with mepolizumab, an anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody, therefore offers a potential therapeutic option for EGPA. The objective of study MEA115921 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab compared with placebo wherein the subjects were randomized to receive either: 300 milligram (mg) mepolizumab or Placebo subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks in addition to their background standard-of-care therapy. Subjects were treated for a period of 52 weeks and then followed up for a further 8 weeks to study completion at Week 60. This is a LAP to support provision of open-label mepolizumab on an individual basis to eligible subjects who participated in clinical study MEA115921 and who require a dose of prednisolone (or equivalent) of \\>=5 milligrams per day (mg/day) for adequate control of their EGPA. Eligible subjects can initiate mepolizumab under this LAP within a 6-month period starting from completion of study MEA115921 (that is, at Week 60) or, in case of premature discontinuation from study MEA115921, the subjects will initiate mepolizumab at the time point that would have been Week 60 if the subject had completed the study. Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneously administered mepolizumab at a dose of 300 mg SC every 4 weeks. Eligible subjects will continue to receive mepolizumab under this LAP until mepolizumab is commercially licensed for the treatment of EGPA in the relevant country or until GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) discontinues the program or until the subject meets any of the withdrawal/stopping criteria.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 89 Months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mepolizumab 300 mg","deltaMin":98,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":32,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Japan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":38,"n":100},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Sinusitis","Bronchitis","Asthma"]}}
