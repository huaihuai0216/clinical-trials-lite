Note: Any woman becoming pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study.\n* The participant is known to be allergic to albuterol or any of the excipients in the IMP or rescue medication formulation (that is, lactose \\[milk protein\\]). Dietary lactose intolerance does not exclude the participant from inclusion in the study or as per the investigator's medical discretion.\n* The participant has a history or presence of \"silent\" infections, including positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis.\n\n  * Additional criteria apply, please contact the investigator for more information.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Clinical Exacerbation of COPD (CE-COPD) Rate: Percentage of Participants Who Experienced at Least 1 Moderate or Severe CE-COPD","description":"CE-COPD was an occurrence of either severe CE-COPD or moderate CE-COPD.
