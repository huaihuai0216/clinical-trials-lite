This is a structured interview, which is an interview in which the clinician is provided exact questions to use to inquire about symptoms of depression and explicit standards for rating the intensity of each symptom item. The interview assesses the symptoms which make up the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, which is the standard in the majority of clinical trials in depression. The items are augmented with additional items to reflect better the atypical depressive symptoms usually seen in SAD, eg, increased sleep, weight, appetite and fatigue. On this scale, higher scores reflect increased depression intensity. The maximum score attainable is 63, and the minimum is 0. A score of less than 9 is regarded as consistent with normal mood, the absence of major depression.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"28.6","spread":"6.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27.7","spread":"4.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23.6","spread":"8.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.9","spread":"7.0"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.9","spread":"9.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.4","spread":"7.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18.6","spread":"9.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.8","spread":"8.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.9","spread":"10.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.3","spread":"9.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Clinical Global Impression of Severity","description":"The Clinical Global Impression of Severity is a 7-point scale in which the clinician gives an overall impression of depression severity, with the following anchor points: (1)Normal, not at all ill, (2)Borderline ill, (3) Mildly ill, (4)Moderately ill, (5) Markedly ill, (6)Severely ill, and (7)Among the most severely ill patients.
