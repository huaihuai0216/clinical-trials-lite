day) that provides a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descriptive system of the participant's health and a rating of his or her current health state on a 0-100 VAS. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"202","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"189","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"122","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"78","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"121","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"136","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"82","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"58","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"67","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"58","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"64","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"48","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"26","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"28","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"11","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"197","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"187","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"130","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"82","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"77","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"117","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"115","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"79","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"47","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"61","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"57","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"58","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"38","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"34","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"27","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"8","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"254","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"249","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"164","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"114","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"108","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"104","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"113","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"67","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"45","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"46","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"25","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"5","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"251","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"245","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"159","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"105","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"101","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"102","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"72","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"44","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"48","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"18","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"6","spread":null}]},{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1"
