It is widely distributed across the globe: the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 2,4 billion people live in endemic areas for canine rabies. Vaccination of domestic animals is limited to industrialized and middle-income countries.\n\nThe development of clinical rabies can be prevented through timely immunization after exposure: however, preventive vaccination simplifies the post-exposure procedure considerably, as immunoglobulins are no longer needed and less vaccine administrations are scheduled. Pre-exposure prophylaxis consists of an intramuscular (IM)of intradermal (ID) dose given on days 0, 7 and 21 or 28. The development of immunological memory after this vaccination is critical for the establishment of long lasting immunity. Subjects receiving a booster dose 1 year after pre-exposure prophylaxis segregate themselves into 'good' and 'poor' responders; the former may not need further boosters for 10 years, whereas the latter may need more frequent boosters.\n\nUntil recently, guidelines in travel medicine recommended pre-exposure vaccination only for some risk groups. Since recent studies have shown the effectiveness of the ID vaccination, the policies are changing towards pre-exposure vaccination for a larger population, including travelers to endemic regions, where immunoglobulins and vaccine are often not readily available.\n\nBased on the above, the investigators must stress the concept of \"boostability\" after a risk exposure. However, the current pre-exposure vaccination scheme could be improved: a schedule of 1 week would be less time consuming, would improve compliance and give less interference with other prophylaxis measures, e.g. mefloquine. Two small studies suggest that a schedule of 1 week interval is as effective and immunogenic as the standard one.\n\nThe investigators will investigate whether the accelerated schedule is as effective as the classical schedule, by carrying out a randomized, non-inferiority study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With a Boostability of the Rabies Antibodies After Booster Vaccination","timeFrame":"Day 7 after booster vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Standard Vaccination Schedule","deltaMin":185,"sd":null},{"arm":"Accelerated Vaccination Schedule","deltaMin":183,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Belgium"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29939243"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2011-001612-62/BE"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":249},"commonTop":[]}}
