Note: Infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease \\[GERD\\] may participate in the study if the GERD is well controlled with or without medication.\n* Known or suspected impairment of immunological function, including severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID).\n* Has a fever, with an axillary temperature ≥37.5°C (or equivalent) at the time of vaccination or within 24 hours prior to vaccination. Note: The Visit 1 may be rescheduled after complete resolution of febrile illness.\n* Has acute disease.\n* Has underlying diseases such as cardiovascular, renal, liver, or blood disease.\n* History of known hypersensitivity to any components of rotavirus vaccine and/or IPV.\n* Uncontrolled epilepsy, encephalopathy, seizure, or other progressive neurological diseases.\n* Known thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder that would contraindicate intramuscular injections.\n* Resides in a household with an immunocompromised person, including individuals with congenital immunodeficiency (including SCID), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, generalized malignance, chronic renal failure, organ or bone marrow transplantation, or with those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy including long-term systemic corticosteroids.\n* Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.\n* Prior administration of any rotavirus vaccines or poliovirus vaccines.\n* Has received inactivated or recombinant vaccines within 14 days prior to Visit 1 or live vaccines within 28 days prior to Visit 1.\n* Has received an investigational or non-registered product other than study vaccines or is planning to use such product during the study.\n* Has received immunosuppressive therapies including systemic (intramuscular, oral, or intravenous) corticosteroids. Note: Participants using non-systemic corticosteroids (e.g., topical, ophthalmic, and inhaled) are considered eligible for the study.\n* Has received a blood transfusion or blood products, including immunoglobulins or is planning to receive such product during the study.\n* Has participated in another interventional study prior to Visit 1 or expected to anytime during the study.\n* The infant's legally acceptable representative is unlikely to adhere to the study procedures, keep appointments or is planning to permanently relocate from the area prior to the completion of the study or to leave for an extended period when study visits would need to be scheduled.\n* Is or has an immediate family member (e.g., spouse, parent/legal guardian, sibling, or child) who is an investigational site or Sponsor staff member directly involved with this study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"48 Days","maximumAge":"63 Days","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Neutralizing Antibody Seroconversion to Poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3 at 1 Month Post Dose 3 of IPV","description":"The immunogenicity of IPV was measured using poliovirus serum neutralizing antibody assay of the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC), Beijing, China.
