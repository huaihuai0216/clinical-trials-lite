Its primary objective is to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of IPV in the concomitant-use group is non-inferior to the immunogenicity of IPV in the staggered-use group. The hypothesis to be tested is: The seroconversion percentage at 1 month post dose 3 for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 in the concomitant-use group is non-inferior to those of the staggered-use group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving Neutralizing Antibody Seroconversion to Poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3 at 1 Month Post Dose 3 of IPV","timeFrame":"Baseline and 1 month postdose 3 of IPV (Month ~3.5)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Concomitant RotaTeq and IPV","deltaMin":98.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Staggered RotaTeq and IPV","deltaMin":100,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"48 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38509699"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":189},"commonTop":["Injection site erythema","Diarrhoea","Pyrexia","Upper respiratory tract infection","Vomiting"]}}
