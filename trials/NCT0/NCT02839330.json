Subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either aH5N1c vaccine or saline placebo. Enrollment was stratified by age: 18 to \\<65 years of age and ≥65 years of age, to allow adequate safety assessment of the entire age spectrum.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary Immunogenicity Endpoint: Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) at Day 43 by Lot","timeFrame":"Day 1, Day 43","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A: aH5N1c Lot #1","deltaMin":16.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group B: aH5N1c Lot #2","deltaMin":17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group C: aH5N1c Lot #3","deltaMin":17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":26,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35455245"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":161,"n":2395},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
