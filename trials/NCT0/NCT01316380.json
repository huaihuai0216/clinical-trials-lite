Tiotropium inhalation solution will be delivered via Respimat inhaler and will be examined on top of maintenance inhaled corticosteroid treatment in patients with mild persistent asthma. Efficacy and safety will be assessed by measuring the effects on lung functions, effects on lung exacerbations, effects on asthma control and numbers of adverse events.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Response Within 3 Hours Post Dosing (0-3h) After a Treatment Period of 12 Weeks.","timeFrame":"Baseline and 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.134,"sd":0.026},{"arm":"Tio R2.5","deltaMin":0.293,"sd":0.026},{"arm":"Tio R5","deltaMin":0.262,"sd":0.026}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0005"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":62,"countries":["Argentina","Austria","Croatia","Estonia","Guatemala","Hungary","India","Italy","Latvia","Poland","Slovakia","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36472162","32180164","31319851","26563670"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":155},"commonTop":["Asthma","Peak expiratory flow rate decreased"]}}
