The main aims of the study are to learn if TAK-019 can protect people from Covid-19 and to check for side effects from TAK-019 for participants who will receive TAK-019 as heterologous booster vaccination.\n\nThis study consists of two parts, main part and extension part. Firstly, participants who completed 2 doses primary vaccinations 6 to 12 months prior to the trial vaccination can take part in main study. At the first visit of main part of this study, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. Participants who can take part will receive an injection of TAK-019 as booster vaccination.\n\nParticipants will be asked to record their temperature and any medical problems in an electronic diary for up to 7 days after the injection. During the main part, participants will visit the clinic for regular check-ups, blood tests, and sometimes for nose swab samples. When all participants have attended a clinic visit 28 days after the injection, the study sponsor (Takeda) will check how many participants have made enough antibodies to protect them against Covid-19.\n\nParticipants who received the first single booster vaccination of TAK-019 in the main part and remained in study follow-up at least 5 months will be able to decide to take part in the extension part of this study. At the first visit of extension part of this study, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. Participants who can take part will receive an injection of TAK-019 as a second booster vaccination at the first visit of extension part.\n\nThe participants will stay in the main part of this study for up to 12 months after they have had their injection or up to the start of extension part. For participants who will take part in the extension part, they will stay in the extension part for up to 12 months from the start of extension part. During this time, the doctors will continue to collect blood samples to check immune response. Also, they will check if participants have any more side effects from TAK-019.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Main Part: Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) Ratio of Neutralizing Antibody Titers to the Ancestral Strain (Wild-type Virus) on Day 15 Compared With That Observed on Day 36 in Participants From the TAK-019-1501 Study","timeFrame":"Day 15 for this study (14 days after the vaccination); Day 36 for TAK-019-1501 study (14 days after the second vaccination)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Main Part: Day 15 of This Study: TAK-019","deltaMin":1143.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Day 36 for TAK-019-1501 Study","deltaMin":884.4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38129286","37198021"],"seeAlso":["https://clinicaltrials.takeda.com/study-detail/234514379776426d?id="]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":150},"commonTop":["Tenderness","Injection site pain","Malaise","Headache","Myalgia"]}}
