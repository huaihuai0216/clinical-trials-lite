Subjects must also agree not to discontinue or to change their regimen for the duration of the study except as judged medically necessary.\n* Must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.\n* Must have voluntarily provided written informed consent and a subject authorization under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), prior to any study-related procedure that is not part of normal medical care, and with the understanding that the subject may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n* If female, subjects must either:\n\n  * Be post menopausal (=/\\>1 year) or surgically sterilized (i.e., have undergone tubal ligation or hysterectomy), or\n  * Use a contraceptive method for the duration of the study such as: hormonal contraceptive,intra uterine device,diaphragm with spermicide, or condom with spermicide, and\n  * Must be neither pregnant nor breast feeding.\n  * Confirmation that female subjects of childbearing potential are not pregnant must be established by a negative pregnancy test prior to initiating first treatment.\n\nA pregnancy test is not required if the subject is post menopausal or surgically sterilized.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Have any condition, which interferes with informed consent or protocol compliance including, but not limited to, active substance abuse and/or dementia.\n* Have any active malignancy, except localized cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (fewer than 10 lesions, none of which are larger than 2 cm, and not on active therapy).\n* Have active central nervous system (CNS) process associated with neurological findings.\n* Have acute illness treated in an intensive care unit, e.g., due to complications following open heart or abdominal surgery, multiple accidental trauma, or acute respiratory failure.\n* Have any medical condition in view of which the study doctor and/or Serono Medical/Therapeutic Director feels that it would be in the best interest of the subject not to participate in the follow-up study.\n* Are unable to comply with the Concomitant Therapy restrictions as outlined in Section 5.5 and listed as follows:\n\n  * Therapy for obesity including therapy with anorexigenic or fat reducing drugs.\n  * Anti-diabetic or insulin sensitizing medications.\n  * Systemic glucocorticoids.\n  * Systemic chemotherapy, interferon or radiation therapy treatment.\n  * Androgenic agents including, but not limited to, testosterone, nandrolone (Deca-durabolin), oxandrolone (Oxandrin), oxymetholone (Anadrol), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), etc. (Testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadism is the exception to this exclusion and will be allowed if started \\>30 days prior to Study Day 1 of Serono Study 24380).\n  * Progestational agents, unless used for oral contraception or post-menopausal hormone replacement therapy.\n  * Appetite stimulants such as dronabinol (Marinol), megestrol acetate (Megace), or cyproheptadine (Periactin).\n  * Investigational agents, unless approved in advance by Serono's Medical Director. Specifically, experimental antiretroviral agents are disallowed, unless available under a treatment IND or expanded access program (30 days).\n  * Liposuction or other elective plastic surgery.\n  * Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) wasting therapy with growth hormone and/or prior treatment with growth hormone or a growth hormone releasing factor (for 12 months prior to the screening visit).\n* Are participating in any other clinical studies (except Serono Study 24380). Observation studies are allowed, but prior written permission by Serono Medical/Therapeutic Director must be granted.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Trunk Fat as Assessed by Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) Scan","description":null,"paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.7","spread":"1.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Waist Circumference","description":"Measured by anthropometry","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.5","spread":"3.0"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Insulin-like Growth Factor I","description":"Circulating levels of IGF-I","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"135.7","spread":"210.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing - Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Fasting Insulin","description":"Oral glucose tolerance testing","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10.8","spread":"22.3"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing - Change From Baseline to Week 12 in 120 Minute Glucose","description":"Oral glucose testing","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.7","spread":"43.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing - Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Fasting Glucose","description":"Oral glucose testing","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.5","spread":"20.4"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":126},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheral","Arthralgia","Hypoaesthesia","Blood glucose increased","Joint swelling"]}}}
