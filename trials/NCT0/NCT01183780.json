Note that a participant must have received a minimum of 2 doses of bevacizumab as part of a first-line regimen containing chemotherapy; in addition, a participant must have received at least 1 cycle of first-line therapy that included bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine in the same cycle.

For participants with rectal cancer, sequential neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy will count as a single systemic regimen.
