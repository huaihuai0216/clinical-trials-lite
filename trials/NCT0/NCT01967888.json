It involves 100 adult recipients of an intra-hepatic pancreatic Islet Auto-Transplantation (IAT).\n\nThe objective of this clinical trial is to assess whether reparixin leads to improved transplant outcome as measured by the proportion of insulin-independent patients following IAT. The safety of reparixin in the specific clinical setting will be also evaluated.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients Who Were Insulin Independent After Islet Autotransplantation (IAT) at Day 365±14 Days After Transplant.","timeFrame":"day 365±14 after the transplant","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Reparixin","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":21.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.542"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["United States","Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":29,"n":50},"commonTop":["Procedural pain","Anaemia","Hypokalaemia","Nausea","Constipation"]}}
