Males or females ≥18 years old\n2. Diagnosis of ABSSSI suspected or confirmed to be caused by a gram-positive pathogen requiring at least 7 days of IV therapy\n3. An ABSSSI included 1 of the following infections: wound infections, cellulitis/erysipelas, major cutaneous abscess\n4. ABSSSI must have presented with at least 2 local signs and symptoms and at least 1 sign of systemic inflammation (unless \\>70 years of age).\n5. Able to give informed consent and willing to comply with all required study procedures\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants were excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria applied prior to randomization:\n\n1. Prior systemic or topical antibacterial therapy with activity against suspected or proven gram-positive pathogens within the preceding 14 days unless:\n\n   * The causative gram-positive pathogen(s) isolated from the ABSSSI site was/were resistant in vitro to the antibacterial(s) that was/were administered with documented clinical progression.\n   * Documented failure to previous ABSSSI antibiotic therapy was available. Documentation of treatment failure must have been recorded.\n   * Participant received a single dose of a short-acting antibacterial therapy 3 or more days before randomization.\n2. Infections associated with, or in close proximity to, a prosthetic device\n3. Severe sepsis or refractory shock\n4. Known or suspected bacteremia at time of Screening\n5. ABSSSI due to or associated with any of the following:\n\n   * Infections suspected or documented to be caused by gram-negative pathogens\n   * Wound infections (surgical or traumatic) and abscesses with only gram-negative pathogens\n   * Diabetic foot infections\n   * Concomitant infection at another site not including a secondary ABSSSI lesion\n   * Infected burns\n   * A primary infection secondary to a pre-existing skin disease with associated inflammatory changes\n   * Decubitus or chronic skin ulcer, or ischemic ulcer due to peripheral vascular disease\n   * Any evolving necrotizing process gangrene or infection suspected or proven to be caused by Clostridium species\n   * Infections known to be caused by a gram-positive organism with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration \\>2 micrograms/milliliter or clinically failing prior therapy with glycopeptides\n   * Catheter site infections\n6.

Contraindication to vancomycin\n15. Participants unwilling to forego blood and/or blood product donation\n16. Treatment with investigational medicinal product within 30 days before enrollment and for the duration of the study\n17. Investigational device present, or removed \\<30 days before enrollment, or presence of device-related infection\n18.
