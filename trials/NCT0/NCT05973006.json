The booster targets a particular variant of COVID-19, Omicron XBB.1.5. The main focus is on safety: researchers want to see if this new booster is safe for teenagers who have already received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. To ensure a fair comparison, the study will use a double-blind approach. This means two groups of teenagers will receive booster shots, but neither the teenagers nor the researchers giving the shots will know beforehand which version of the booster each person gets. The study will also assess how well the body fights the virus after the booster shot.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Participants With Solicited Local and Systemic AEs for 7 Days Following Vaccination","timeFrame":"Day 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group-A NVX-CoV2601","deltaMin":153,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group-B Bivalent NVX CoV2373 + NVX CoV2601","deltaMin":166,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"11 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":20,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":190},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
