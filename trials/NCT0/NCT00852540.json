Subjects aged 2 months and older will be treated with either topical retapamulin for 5 days or oral linezolid for 10 days. The primary endpoint is the clinical response at follow-up (7-9 days after the end of therapy) in subjects who have a MRSA infection at baseline. The primary population is the per-protocol MRSA population. It is anticipated that approximately 500 subjects may be enrolled in order to obtain approximately 105 subjects who have a baseline MRSA infection.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Response at Follow-up Who Had Methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus Aureus (MRSA) as a Baseline Pathogen","timeFrame":"7-9 days post-therapy; Day 12-14 for retapamulin and Day 17-19 for linezolid","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Retapamulin Ointment, 1% (Weight/Weight) Plus Oral Placebo","deltaMin":41,"sd":null},{"arm":"Linezolid Plus Placebo Ointment","deltaMin":32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":53,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25396674"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":267},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Nausea"]}}
