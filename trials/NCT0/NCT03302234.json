The primary hypothesis of this study is that overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free survival (PFS) is prolonged in participants who receive pembrolizumab and ipilimumab compared to those who receive pembrolizumab and placebo.\n\nWith Amendment 6 (effective date: 11-Dec-2020), active participants, investigator, and sponsor personnel or delegate(s) involved in the treatment administration or clinical evaluation of the participants will be unblinded. Participants will discontinue ipilimumab and placebo and participants who remain on treatment will receive open-label pembrolizumab only.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Up to approximately 32 months (through data cut-off date: 01 Sep 2020)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab + Ipilimumab","deltaMin":21.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pembrolizumab + Placebo","deltaMin":21.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.74156"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":23},"locations":{"siteCount":187,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Colombia","France","Germany","Hungary","Ireland","Italy","Latvia","Mexico","Peru","Poland","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33513313"],"seeAlso":["https://www.merckclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":146,"n":282},"commonTop":["Pruritus","Diarrhoea","Cough","Rash","Decreased appetite"]}}
