This \"practical clinical trial\" will (1) enroll a representative sample of asthma patients encountered in the practices of primary care physicians, (2) employ standard clinical trial methodology to ensure internally valid results and (3) measure outcomes important to patients, so that the results will be valid and applicable to the kinds of asthma patients encountered by family physicians and other primary care providers.\n\nActive study sites -\n\n* Wisconsin: Augusta, Cross Plains, La Crosse, Marshfield, Milwaukee, Madison,\n* Mauston, Rice Lake, Tomah, Wausau\n* Colorado: Monument\n* Illinois: Peoria\n* Nevada: Reno\n* North Carolina: Granite Falls\n* North Dakota: Minot\n* Ohio: Cleveland, Berea\n* Oklahoma: Ardmore, Claremore, Edmond, Lawton, Oklahoma City, Stroud, Tulsa, Weatherford\n* Rhode Island: East Providence","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Overall Asthma Symptoms From Baseline","timeFrame":"Within the past 24 hours; measured every 1.5 months for one year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.6,"sd":1.07},{"arm":"Azithromycin","deltaMin":-0.15,"sd":0.83},{"arm":"Observational Cohort","deltaMin":-0.88,"sd":0.81}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["15226283","7561707","10541419","16871333","22773713"],"seeAlso":["https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/store/books/a-cure-for-asthma-what-your-doctor-isnt-telling-you-and-why/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":37},"commonTop":["Diarrhea","Stomach Pain","Nausea","Rash","Vaginal Candidasis"]}}
