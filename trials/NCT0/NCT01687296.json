According to Chinese Guideline for the diagnosis and optimal management of asthma in children \\[Respiratory branch of pediatric society,Chinese Medical. Association. 2008, revised version\\], the subjects can be diagnosed when meeting the criteria. The diagnosis criteria is listed in the protocol.\n* The severity of an acute exacerbation of asthma is defined as PEF of 50% to 75% predicted via a peak flow meter, with a clinical scoring index of ≥2. The clinical scoring index represents the sum of the score for each of four signs: respiratory rate (0=low to 3=high, dependent on age), wheezing (0=none to 3=severe), inspiration/expiration ratio (0=2:1 to 3=1:3), and accessory muscle (0=none to 3=marked use).\n* Subjects can properly use a mini-wright peak flow meter, nebulizer and MDI with/without a spacer, and accurately complete a diary card with parental assistance, if required.\n* Subjects' parents/guardians are willing to give written informed consent.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* Severe respiratory dysfunction.\n* History of mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.\n* Admission to hospital due to respiratory disease within the previous 2 weeks, including asthmatic exacerbations.\n* Clinical or lab evidence of a serious, uncontrolled systemic disease or presence of any disease likely to interfere with the objectives of this study, such as pulmonary cystic fibrosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.\n* Known or suspected hypersensitivity to glucocorticosteroids or β2 agonists.\n* Clinical visual evidence of oral candidiasis at Visit1.\n* Use of the medications below in Table 1 according to the following defined time intervals prior to presentation.
