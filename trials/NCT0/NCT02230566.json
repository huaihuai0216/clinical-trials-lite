The Blind Start is a novel design whereby participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups, each representing a different treatment sequence, and will cross over to UX003 at different pre-defined time points in a blinded manner. All groups will receive a minimum of 24 weeks treatment with 4 mg/kg UX003 every other week (QOW).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"European Union (EU) and Rest of World: Percentage Change From Baseline in Urinary Glycosaminoglycan (uGAG) Dermatan Sulfate (DS) at UX003 Treatment Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline (defined as the average of all assessments prior to or on the date of cross-over to active treatment with UX003) to 24 weeks of UX003 study drug treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UX003 4 mg/kg","deltaMin":-64.82,"sd":2.468}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"5 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32063397","29478819","37415957","33874971","30467742"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":9},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Pain in extremity","Infusion site extravasation","Cough","Vomiting"]}}
