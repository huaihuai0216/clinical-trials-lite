After the end of the induction period, participants achieving response (Complete response \\[CR\\] or partial response \\[PR\\]) will undergo a maintenance period continuing on the randomized antibody treatment alone every 2 months until disease progression for a total of 2 years. Anticipated time on study treatment is up to approximately 2.5 years. After maintenance or observation, participants will be followed for 5 years until progression. After progression, participants will be followed for new anti-lymphoma therapy and overall survival until the end of the study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival in the Follicular Lymphoma Population, Investigator-Assessed","timeFrame":"Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 4 years and 7 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Rituximab+Chemotherapy","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"Obinutuzumab+Chemotherapy","deltaMin":16.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0012"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":183,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","China","Czechia","Finland","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Japan","Russia","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38096461","36379880","35194005","34323957","32314038","31053601","30341058","30309758","29856692","28976863"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":309,"n":692},"commonTop":["INFUSION RELATED REACTION","NAUSEA","NEUTROPENIA","FATIGUE","CONSTIPATION"]}}
