These attacks are often painful and disabling, and, in some cases, life-threatening. \"HAE\" is caused by mutations in the \"C1INH\" gene that leads to a decrease in the blood level of functional \"C1INH\". This multi-center study was designed to assess the safety and tolerability, efficacy and pharmacodynamics/ pharmacokinetics of recombinant human C1 inhibitor (\"rhC1INH\") in the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema attacks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to Beginning of Relief of Symptoms","timeFrame":"up to 48 hours after study drug administration","effectByArm":[{"arm":"100 IU/kg \"rhC1INH\"","deltaMin":62,"sd":null},{"arm":"Saline","deltaMin":508,"sd":null},{"arm":"1 Vial (2100 IU) \"rhC1INH\"","deltaMin":61,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Netherlands","Romania"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20920772","22909164","28284978"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":16},"commonTop":["headache","nausea","pain","menstrual disorder","scrotal swelling"]}}
