Different types of intravenous (into the vein, IV) contrast are available to fill the vessels and make them easier to see. The purpose of the study is to determine the best type of contrast for this scan.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Contrast to Noise Ratio","timeFrame":"during scan, approximately 3 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Visipaque 320","deltaMin":18.6,"sd":5.2},{"arm":"Isovue 370","deltaMin":20.5,"sd":4.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":16},"commonTop":[]}}
