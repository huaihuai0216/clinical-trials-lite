Use of any investigational or non-registered product with immunosuppressive properties is exclusionary at any time during the trial.\n* Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study enrolment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of influenza vaccines (including egg proteins or mercurial preservatives); a history of anaphylactic-type reaction to consumption of eggs; or a history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccine.\n* Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test result prior to either vaccination.\n* Lactating women.\n* Women of child bearing potential who lack a history of reliable contraceptive practices. The provision of this history does NOT replace the requirement to perform, and obtain negative results in pregnancy urine tests prior to treatments.\n* Known use of an analgesic or antipyretic medication within 12 hours prior to first treatment.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"59 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Titers for Serum H5N1 Haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) Antibodies","description":"Titers are presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs).
