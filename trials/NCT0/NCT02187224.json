Participants will be randomized to receive either progesterone (200 mg. bid) or placebo in identical looking capsules for three days.\n\nOne goal of this research study is to test if progesterone is more effective than placebo in reducing craving after exposure to trauma cues and alcohol cues in a laboratory paradigm among men and women with AD and PTSD. We hypothesize that progesterone in comparison to placebo will significantly reduce craving for alcohol in response to trauma cues alone and in combination with alcohol cues in individuals with AD and PTSD.\n\nA second goal is to examine if there are gender differences in progesterone effects on stress and alcohol cue-induced craving. We hypothesize that the effects of progesterone on stress and craving will be stronger in women than in men. Participants will be recruited primarily through advertisement, but also through the clinical facilities at the VA and from other collaborators.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Visual Analogue Scale of Craving (VASC) Baseline no Script","timeFrame":"Baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Progesterone","deltaMin":1.29,"sd":0.78},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.6,"sd":0.89}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38147491"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":7},"commonTop":[]}}
