The total score ranges from 0-24, with a higher number representing an increased propensity for sleepiness. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used for the analysis of ESS scores.

The FOSQ-10 consists of 10 questions, each scored on a scale from 1-4. The questionnaire has a 4-point response format for each question (1 = extreme difficulty, 2 = moderate difficulty, 3 = a little difficulty, and 4 = no difficulty). The total score is derived by the mean of the 5 subscale scores, multiplied by 5, resulting in a possible range of scores between 5 to 20; lower FOSQ-10 scores are worse, indicating more difficulty carrying out activities; higher FOSQ-10 scores are better, indicating less difficulty carrying out activities.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.15","spread":"0.393"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.31","spread":"0.381"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":174},"commonTop":["Headache","Dizziness","Dry mouth","Nausea","Insomnia"]}}}
