ZD6474 is a new anti-cancer drug in development that works in a different way to standard chemotherapy drugs. It targets the growth of new blood vessels to a tumour and thereby might slow the rate at which the tumour may grow. Early studies indicate that ZD6474 has a positive effect on the time that a tumour may take to progress to a further stage. Approximately 930 patients will take part in this study. It will be conducted in hospitals and clinics in North and South America, Europe and Asia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS)","timeFrame":"Time to death in months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Vandetanib 300 mg","deltaMin":8.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":7.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":102,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Peru","Philippines","Singapore","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25881079"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=342&filename=CSR-D4200C00044.pdf","http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=342&filename=CSR-D4200C00044.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":160,"n":619},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Rash","Decreased Appetite","Nausea","Hypertension"]}}
