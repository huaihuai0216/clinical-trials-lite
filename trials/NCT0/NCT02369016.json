A previous regimen is defined as one of the following: at least two months of single-agent therapy, at least two consecutive cycles of polychemotherapy, autologous transplant, radioimmunotherapy.\n* Prior therapy must include rituximab and alkylating agents.Prior exposure to idelalisib or other PI3K inhibitors is acceptable (except to copanlisib) provided that there is no resistance.\n* Patients must be refractory to the last rituximab-based treatment, defined as no response or response lasting \\< 6 months after completion of treatment. Time interval to assess refractoriness will be calculated between the end date (last day) of the last rituximab-containing regimen and the day of diagnosis confirmation of the subsequent relapse.\n* Patients must have at least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (which has not been previously irradiated) according to the Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification.\n* Patients affected by WM, who do not have at least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion in the baseline radiologic assessment, must have measurable disease, defined as presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) paraprotein with a minimum IgM level ≥ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)and positive immunofixation test.\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 1\n* Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Histologically confirmed diagnosis of FL grade 3b.\n* Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n* Transformed disease (assessed by investigator):\n\n  * histological confirmation of transformation, or\n  * clinical and laboratory signs: rapid disease progression, high standardized uptake value (SUV) (\\> 12) by positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline if PET scans are performed (optional).\n* Bulky disease - Lymph nodes or tumor mass (except spleen) \\>= 7cm LD (longest diameter)\n* Known lymphomatous involvement of the central nervous system.\n* Uncontrolled arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management (per investigator's assessment).\n* Type I or II diabetes mellitus with HbA1c \\> 8.5% at Screening.\n* Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n* Active clinically serious infections \\> CTCAE Grade 2\n* Active Hepatitis B or hepatitis C\n* History or concurrent condition of interstitial lung disease of any severity and/or severely impaired lung function (as judged by the investigator)\n* History of having received an allogeneic bone marrow or organ transplant\n* Positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR test at baseline\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding patients","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)s","description":"Adverse event data were collected after signing the informed consent until 30 days after the last study drug administration (end of safety follow-up)","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"24","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAE)s","description":"Serious adverse event data were collected after signing the informed consent until 30 days after the last study drug administration (end of safety follow-up)","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"11","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Abnormal Laboratory Parameters","description":"\\- Above threshold of 10% and reported as TEAEs -
