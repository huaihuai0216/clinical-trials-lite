The traditional regimen for pain control post-operatively is opioid-based however in light of the opioid epidemic, a transition to non-opioid pain medication regimens is desired by both physicians and patients alike. The goal of this study is to develop a multimodal non-opioid pain medication regimen that minimizes postoperative opioid use after robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Historical controls from January, 2017 to January, 2020 will be compared to our treatment arm from November, 2020 to November, 2022. Included in our treatment protocol is paracervical block and local ropivacaine at abdominal incision sites at surgical start, gabapentin and acetaminophen preoperatively and postoperatively, and celecoxib postoperatively. Opioid use will be measured 0-3 h postop and 3-24h postop (as surrogate marker of time spent recovering in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), and during the full length of hospital stay); pain scores will additionally be measured.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Opioid Pain Medications Required 0-3h Post op in Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME)","timeFrame":"0-3 hours after surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Prospective Cohort","deltaMin":2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Historical Control","deltaMin":5.32,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"25 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28043841","30646274"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":[]}}
