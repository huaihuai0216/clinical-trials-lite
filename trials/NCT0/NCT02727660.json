The scores range from 0 (minimum, best possible health status) to 100 (maximum, worst possible health status). The SGRQ contains 76 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, activity and impacts). Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the SGRQ total score at that visit minus Baseline. A decrease from baseline in SGRQ total score of 4 units or more is considered a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"54","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":60,"n":619},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Upper respiratory tract infection","Dyspnoea","Headache"]}}}
