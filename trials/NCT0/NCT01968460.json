Both rasagiline and pramipexole are well known marketed drugs for Parkinson's disease with a good safety profile. combining the drugs in low doses and controlled release may provide better symptom management than the existing drugs alone or together.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total UPDRS I, II, III Scores","timeFrame":"Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"P2B001 Treatment A","deltaMin":-5.97,"sd":0.94},{"arm":"P2B001 Treatment B","deltaMin":-5.15,"sd":0.9},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-1.31,"sd":0.88}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0004"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0027"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":29,"countries":["United States","Israel"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":49},"commonTop":["NAUSEA","SOMNOLENCE","DIZZINESS","tremor","nasopharyngitis"]}}
