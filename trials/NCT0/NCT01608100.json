All subject diagnoses were adjudicated by three board certified cardiologists according to current standard of care. ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin I results were generated from subject specimens and evaluated for use as an aid in the assessment of prognosis. Analyses used the first available troponin result from multiple serial draw time points. Subjects were assessed for risk of all cause mortality (ACM) and major adverse cardiac event (MACE) at 30 day and 90 day time points after ED discharge. MACE consisted of myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, and cardiac death. Subjects were followed-up for subsequent events by medical record review and/or subject/caregiver contact. Any ACM and MACE that occurred during the ED visit and on the same day as ED discharge were not included in the analyses.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"30","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"29","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"802","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"791","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"803","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"790","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"796","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"784","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"19","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"34","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"13","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"26","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"226","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"212","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"246","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"231","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"201","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"188","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Clinical Performance- Sensitivity","description":"The ARCHITECT STAT High Sensitive Troponin-I assay clinical performance was evaluated by calculating Sensitivity.
