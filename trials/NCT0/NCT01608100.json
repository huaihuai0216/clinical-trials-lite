Blood specimens will be tested using the new investigational test that detects the level of Troponin I. Results will be compared to the diagnosis of whether or not an acute myocardial infarction (MI) occurred.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Clinical Performance - Area Under the Curve","timeFrame":"Troponin value from three collection time points (0-2 hours, >2 and up to 4 hours, >4 hours and up to 9 hours) from subject presentation to the emergency department","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Area Under the Curve in K2 EDTA","deltaMin":0.9326,"sd":null},{"arm":"Area Under the Curve in Lithium Heparin Separator","deltaMin":0.9197,"sd":null},{"arm":"Area Under the Curve in Serum Separator","deltaMin":0.9412,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG002","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":1101},"commonTop":[]}}
