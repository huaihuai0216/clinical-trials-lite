Approximately 500 000 new cases are reported each year worldwide, from which 83% occur in developing countries. The incidence of cervical cancer varies depending on the region of the world. Africa has some of the highest age-standardized incidence and mortality rates in the world (Eastern Africa 42.7 and 34.6 per 100 000; Southern Africa 38.2 and 22.6 per 100 000; Western Africa 29.3 and 23.8 per 100 000; Middle Africa 28.0 and 23.0 per 100 000).\n\nAs in the majority of developing countries, organization of cervical cancer screening programs in Africa is difficult to manage, especially in rural areas. HPV prophylactic vaccination could therefore clearly and efficiently decrease the incidence of cervical cancer. The current study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine in female subjects enrolled from multiple countries in Africa.\n\nIdeally, HPV vaccination should be performed before onset of sexual activity, since studies have shown that acquisition of high-risk HPV occurs soon after sexual debut. This study will therefore be performed in subjects aged 10 to 25 years of age.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Seroconverted Subjects for Anti-human Papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and 18 Antibodies","timeFrame":"At Month 7","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix Group","deltaMin":130,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo Group","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Senegal","Tanzania"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23242542","23486859"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":450},"commonTop":["Pain","Headache","Pyrexia","Gastrointestinal disorder","Fatigue"]}}
