Planned PCI (including staged procedures) or CABG after the index procedure\n* Subject previously treated at any time with intravascular brachytherapy\n* Subject has a known allergy to contrast (that cannot be adequately premedicated) and/or the trial stent system or protocol-required concomitant medications (e.g., platinum, platinum-chromium alloy, stainless steel, everolimus or structurally related compounds, polymer or individual components, all P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, or ticagrelor), or aspirin)\n* Subject has one of the following (as assessed prior to the index procedure):\n\n  * Other serious medical illness (e.g., cancer, congestive heart failure) with estimated life expectancy of less than 24 months\n  * Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc.)\n  * Planned procedure that may cause non-compliance with the protocol or confound data interpretation\n* Subject is receiving chronic (≥72 hours) anticoagulation therapy (i.e., heparin, coumadin) for indications other than acute coronary syndrome\n* Subject has a platelet count \\<100,000 cells/mm3 or \\>700,000 cells/mm3\n* Subject has a white blood cell (WBC) count \\< 3,000 cells/mm3\n* Subject has documented or suspected liver disease, including laboratory evidence of hepatitis\n* Subject is on dialysis or has baseline serum creatinine level \\>2.0 mg/dL (177µmol/L)\n* Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions\n* Subject has had a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months\n* Subject has an active peptic ulcer or active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding\n* Subject has severe symptomatic heart failure (i.e., New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV)\n* Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device clinical trial that has not reached its primary endpoint\n* Subject intends to participate in another investigational drug or device clinical trial within 12 months after the index procedure\n* Subject with known intention to procreate within 12 months after the index procedure (women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active must agree to use a reliable method of contraception from the time of screening through 12 months after the index procedure)\n* Subject is a woman who is pregnant or nursing (a pregnancy test must be performed within 7 days prior to the index procedure in women of child-bearing potential)\n\nAngiographic Exclusion Criteria (visual estimate)\n\nPlanned treatment of more than 3 lesions\n\n* Planned treatment of lesions in more than 2 major epicardial vessels\n* Planned treatment of a single lesion with more than 1 stent\n* Subject has 2 target lesions in the same vessel that are separated by less than 15 mm (by visual estimate)\n* Target lesion(s) is located in the left main\n* Target lesion(s) is located within 3 mm of the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery or left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery by visual estimate.\n* Target lesion(s) is located within a saphenous vein graft or an arterial graft\n* Target lesion(s) will be accessed via a saphenous vein graft or arterial graft\n* Target lesion(s) with a TIMI flow 0 (total occlusion) or TIMI flow 1 prior to guide wire crossing\n* Target lesion(s) treated during the index procedure that involves a complex bifurcation (e.g., bifurcation lesion requiring treatment with more than 1 stent)\n* Target lesion(s) is restenotic from a previous stent implantation or study stent would overlap with a previous stent\n* Subject has unprotected left main coronary artery disease (\\>50% diameter stenosis)\n* Subject has been treated with any type of PCI (i.e., balloon angioplasty, stent, cutting balloon atherectomy) within 24 hours prior to the index procedure\n* Thrombus, or possible thrombus, present in the target vessel (by visual
