All subjects enrolled will treat up to 4 MILD migraines over a 6 month period. They will be required to have three office visits during the six months. All subjects will be randomized to either Treximet (85mg Imitrex/500mg Naproxen Sodium) or Placebo (sugar-pill) in four of the five treatment arms with a 3 to 1 ratio. A fifth treatment arm will treat all 4 migraines with active drug, Treximet. The hypothesis is that Treximet will prove to be a safe and effective treatment for this population, that has so few treatment for migraine. And Treximet will be superior over placebo for pain free endpoints at 2 and 24 hours.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With 2-hour Pain Free Active Study Drug","timeFrame":"3 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Migraine Attack 1","deltaMin":35,"sd":null},{"arm":"Migraine Attack 2","deltaMin":23,"sd":null},{"arm":"Migraine Attack 3","deltaMin":21,"sd":null},{"arm":"Migraine Attack 4","deltaMin":24,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.0038"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":20},"commonTop":["Neck Spasm/Tension","Throat tightness","Nausea","Drowsiness","Stiff Jaw"]}}
