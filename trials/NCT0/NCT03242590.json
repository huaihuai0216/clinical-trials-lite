Subjects should be diagnosed to be primary (congenital or acquired) or secondary hypogonadal (congenital or acquired).\n3. Naïve to androgen replacement or has discontinued current treatment and completed adequate washout of prior androgen therapy. Washout must be completed prior to collection of baseline serum T samples to determine study eligibility.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
