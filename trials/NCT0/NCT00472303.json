Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The changes in overall mean and in each of the mean sub-scores vary theoretically from -4 to +4 (where a change of +4 would indicate a change from not present to very severe symptom). If the changes in the overall or subscale mean scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation from the start to the end of the titration phase.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.062","spread":"0.6507"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.076","spread":"0.7242"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.059","spread":"0.6442"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.006","spread":"0.6736"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.02","spread":"0.812"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.13","spread":"0.870"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.003","spread":"0.5782"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.027","spread":"0.6154"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) During the Maintenance Phase","description":"The Constipation Assessment (PAC-SYM) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the severity of symptoms of constipation. Participants are asked \"How severe have each of these symptoms been in the last two weeks?\" e.g. \"Pain in your stomach\". There are 3 subscales: 4 questions on Abdominal symptoms, 3 questions on rectal symptoms and 5 questions on stool symptoms. Responses are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (absence of symptom) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The changes in overall mean and in each of the mean sub-scores vary theoretically from -4 to +4 (where a change of +4 would indicate a change from not present to very severe symptom). If the changes in the overall or subscale mean scores are positive then there is a worsening in symptoms associated with constipation from the start to the end of the maintenance phase.
