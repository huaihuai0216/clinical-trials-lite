The study will address the following specific aims:\n\n1. To expand the number of subjects included in the A07 (NCT00857415) trial correlation analysis (measuring the correlation between the global visual rating of brain amyloid plaque density on an independent blinded read of the florbetapir F 18 PET scan and the cortical amyloid plaque density at autopsy as assessed by histopathology for subjects in the autopsy cohort).\n2. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of an independent blinded visual read assessment of the florbetapir F 18 PET scan (Aβ+ or Aβ-) versus the final blinded neuropathological assessment made at autopsy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sensitivity Analysis in All Autopsy Population","timeFrame":"at autopsy within 24 months of florbetapir PET scan","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Subjects With Moderate or Frequent Plaques at Autopsy","deltaMin":36,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22749065"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
