Several chemotherapy (anti-cancer) drugs work well in treating KS, but there is no treatment that cures KSHV infection. One chemotherapy drug called etoposide (VePesid®, ET) has caused KS tumors to get smaller in some people.\n\nAntiretroviral therapy (anti-HIV drugs or ART) is a group of medicines taken together to treat HIV infection. These medicines help to stop HIV from growing in the body. When this happens, the immune system, which fights infection and some cancers like KS, gets stronger. For some people, limited stage KS often improves or stays the same when they take ART. However, in some people KS continues to get worse when taking ART. These people may need chemotherapy at a later date.\n\nThis study was done to find out if taking ART with immediate etoposide (ET) is better than taking ART alone or ART with delayed ET to treat limited stage KS. The study also tried to better understand KSHV and to see what kind of side effects are caused by ART and ET and how safe ART and ET are.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) Status at Week 48 Compared to Study Entry","timeFrame":"Entry through Week 48.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: ART Alone or With Delayed ET","deltaMin":43,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: ART With Immediate ET","deltaMin":47,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.911"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["Brazil","Kenya","Malawi","Peru","South Africa","Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["2671281","11773164","29365083","37368929","31520741"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":94},"commonTop":["Blood sodium decreased","Neutrophil count decreased","Blood albumin decreased","Pyrexia","Cough"]}}
