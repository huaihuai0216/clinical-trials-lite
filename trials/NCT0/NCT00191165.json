This assessment should be made by the central reader of bone ages, based on the x-ray taken at Visit 0.\n* Informed consent obtained from either both of the subject's parents or legal representative.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pubertal clinical stage less than 2 and greater than 3 according to Tanner score (for male subjects a volume of testicle greater than 15 mL).\n* Any evidence of active malignancy. In case of previous surgical removal of both diencephalic and hypophysial masses, an MRI, performed within six months before enrollment into the study, must exclude the growth of residual tumoral tissue.\n* Any known chronic disease such as diabetes mellitus, hepatic disease (defined by elevated liver enzymes 3-fold the upper limit of normal ranges), renal disease with creatinine levels greater than 130 micromol/L, or congestive heart failure.\n* Glucocorticoid therapy in supra physiological doses (inhaled corticoids will be accepted if below 3 puffs/day, for no more than 10 days consecutively).\n* Current or previous therapy with any therapy that may directly influence growth, including growth hormone releasing hormone, estrogens and anabolic steroids.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"14 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Height Velocity Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at 12-Month Endpoint","description":"Height velocity (difference between 2 height measurements, divided by years elapsed between measurements) SDS was derived by subtracting age and gender-matched population mean height velocity from patient's height velocity (based on measurements 12 months apart) then dividing this value by age and gender-matched population height velocity SD.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.83","spread":"0.91"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.38","spread":"1.41"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline to 12-Month and 24-Month Endpoints in Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS)","description":"This was derived by subtracting the age-and-gender-matched population 50th percentile height from the patient's height and then dividing this value by the age-and-gender-matched population height SD.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.49","spread":"0.12"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.34","spread":"0.13"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.88","spread":"0.17"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":"0.18"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Height Velocity Standard Deviation Score (SDS) at 24 Month Endpoint","description":"Height velocity (difference between 2 height measurements, divided by years elapsed between measurements) SDS was derived by subtracting age and gender-matched population mean height velocity from patient's height velocity (based on measurements 12 months apart) then dividing this value by age and gender-matched population height velocity SD.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.58","spread":"1.86"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.45","spread":"1.06"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Gynaecomastia","Melanocytic naevus","Headache","Influenza"]}}}
