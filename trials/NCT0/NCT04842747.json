If patient is on oxygen therapy at the time of presentation for screening and the SpO2 levels were ≤94% prior to introduction to oxygen therapy with proper documentation example EMT notes or ER/ED notes, then the patient is considered to have met this inclusion criterion. If patient is on oxygen therapy at the time of presentation for screening and the SpO2 levels prior to introduction to oxygen therapy are unknown, the patient may be considered to have met this inclusion criterion if oxygen therapy is removed and the SpO2 levels fall to ≤94%, then the patient is considered to have met this inclusion criterion. However, removal of the oxygen therapy should only be done if it is considered medically reasonable\n* Subjects must agree to follow doctor's recommendation for oxygen supplementation\n* Subjects must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception:\n\n  * If female of childbearing potential or a male subject's partner could become pregnant, use acceptable methods of contraception from the time of the first administration of study medication until 6months following administration of the last dose of study medication. Acceptable methods of contraception are as follows: Condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository \\[i.e., barrier method of contraception\\], surgical sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azospermia) and a barrier method {condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository}, the female partner uses oral contraceptives (combination estrogen/progesterone pills), injectable progesterone or subdermal implants and a barrier method (condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)\n  * If the female partner of a male subject has undergone documented tuballigation (female sterilization), a barrier method (condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)should also be used\n  * If female partner of a male subject has undergone documented placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS),a barrier method (condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)should also be used\n* Subject is willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol through the end of the study\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known hypersensitivity or allergy to colchicine\n* Pregnant or currently breast feeding\n* Participation in any other clinical trial of an experimental treatment for COVID- 19. Convalescent plasma, dexamethasone and remdesivir are allowed in this study.\n* Concurrent treatment with other experimental agents with actual or possible direct acting antiviral activity against COVID-19is prohibited \\<24 hours prior to study drug dosing(except standard of care). Remdesivir, dexamethasone and convalescent plasma are allowed in the study.\n* Requiring ventilation + additional organ support - pressors, RRT, ECMO(WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement - Score of 7). NOTE: short term (PRN) use of pressors is allowed\n* Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase(AST) \\>3X upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Total bilirubin \\> ULN\n* Creatinine clearance \\< 60 mL/min\n* Documented medical history of liver disease, including but not limited to, prior diagnosis of hepatitis of any etiology, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, or confirmed or suspected esophageal varices\n* Moderate to severe renal impairment\n* Hepatic impairment\n* History of hepatitis - (Hepatitis B and C) NOTE: treated and controlled hepatitis C is allowed\n* Any comorbid disease or condition (medical or surgical) which might compromise the hematologic, cardiovascular, endocrine, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or central nervous system; or other conditions that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drug, or would place the subject at increased risk\n* Participants must agree to refrain from prolonged exposure to the sun or agree to use at least SPF 50 on all exposed skin and protective clothing during prolonged sun exposure throughout participation in this study and/or treatment with VERU-111","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Efficacy of Sabizabulin in the Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Assessing Its Effect on the Proportion of Patients Who Died on Study.","description":"Efficacy of VERU-111 in the treatment of SARS-Cov- 2 Infection by assessing its effect on the proportion of patients who die on study (prior to Day 60).","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"27","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"The Proportion of Subjects That Are Alive Without Respiratory Failure at Day 15, Day 22 and Day 29.","description":"The proportion of subjects that are alive without respiratory failure at Day 15, Day 22 and Day 29.
