Suitable patients were randomly assigned to antibiotic treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or to a regimen of oral D Mannose for 24 weeks, and received the other intervention in the second phase of the study.\n\nOutcome measurements and statistical analysis- The time to recurrence of UTI, bladder pain (VAS p) and urinary urgency (VAS u) were evaluated at the end of antibiotic therapy and at the and of 24 weeks fo D Mannose. The results for quantitative variables were expressed as mean values and SD as they were all normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test). T-test for paired data was used to analyze differences of time of recurrence, VAS pain, Vas urgency and number of voidings between treatment. Data analysis was performed with STATA statistical package (release 11,1, 2010, Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Days","timeFrame":"168","effectByArm":[{"arm":"D Mannose First, Then Trimethoprim /Sulfamethoxazole","deltaMin":200,"sd":50.7},{"arm":"Trimethoprim /Sulfamethoxazole First, Then D Mannose","deltaMin":52.7,"sd":11.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"22 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["9822381","11402001","10922042","36041061"],"seeAlso":["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC34019/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":60},"commonTop":[]}}
