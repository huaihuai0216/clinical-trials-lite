Prior to receiving radiotherapy, it is recommended that patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer are pre-treated with hormone therapy (so-called neoadjuvant therapy) which is known to reduce the size of the prostate and thereby decrease the required radiation field and enable a more safe and effective treatment. In this trial, participants were randomly selected (like flipping a coin) to receive either degarelix given alone or a standard hormone therapy (combination of goserelin and bicalutamide. The treatment was given for three months and the prostate size was measured by ultra sound at the beginning and at the end of the trial. The participants were required to come to the clinic for 5 or 6 visits during the three months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Prostate Size Based on Trans Rectal Ultra Sound (TRUS) at Week 12 (Full Analysis Set)","timeFrame":"After treatment of 12 weeks compared to Baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Degarelix 240 mg/80 mg","deltaMin":-36,"sd":14.5},{"arm":"Goserelin (3.6 mg) + Bicalutamide (50 mg)","deltaMin":-35.3,"sd":16.7}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.8942"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":66,"countries":["United States","France","Germany","Greece","Netherlands","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34350976","23257248"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":181},"commonTop":["Hot flush","Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Erectile dysfunction","Asthenia"]}}
