It is composed of 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. The PCS score was derived based on the SF-36 V2 User's Manual. Scoring for PCS involves (a) recoding item response values, (b) summing recoded response values for all items in a given scale to obtain the scale raw score, (c) transforming scale raw score to a 0-100 score. The PCS score was computed by (a) multiplying each health domain z score by a scale-specific physical factor score coefficient, (b) summing the resulting products, (c) converting the product total to T score. The total score ranges from 0-100, higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.108","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.731","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE)","description":"AEs included infusion related reactions (IRRs) and serious multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses, but excluded non-serious MS relapses.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"53","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"99","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"59","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"167","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"215","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"462","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"148","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"354","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":58,"n":239},"commonTop":["INFUSION RELATED REACTION","URINARY TRACT INFECTION","NASOPHARYNGITIS","BACK PAIN","ARTHRALGIA"]}}}
