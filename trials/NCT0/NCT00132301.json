The standard of care is surveillance, with the addition of androgen deprivation at the time of biochemical relapse. This study will assess the effect of adding early chemotherapy to the standard of care on progression free survival in Veterans at high risk for progression after prostatectomy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Progression-Free Survival","timeFrame":"Up to 100 months (centralized follow-up)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1: Docetaxel and Prednisone","deltaMin":66,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2: Standard of Care","deltaMin":84,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.40"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31924316"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":47,"n":140},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Hyperglycaemia","Blood glucose increased","White blood cell count decreased","Syncope"]}}
