Patients with HPT often have high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and may have large parathyroid glands in the neck. Patients with HPT can develop bone disease (osteodystrophy). This bone disease can cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red blood cells. Other problems from HPT may include increases in blood levels of calcium (hypercalcemia) and low blood levels of phosphorus (hypophosphatemia). The high calcium levels may cause calcium to deposit in body tissues. Calcium deposits can cause arthritis (joint pain and swelling), muscle inflammation, itching, gangrene (death of soft tissue), heart and lung problems or kidney transplant dysfunction (worsening of kidney transplant function). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of cinacalcet (Sensipar/Mimpara) on high calcium levels in the blood in patients with HPT after a kidney transplant.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With a Mean Corrected Total Serum Calcium Value < 10.2 mg/dL (2.55 mmol/L) During the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP)","timeFrame":"Weeks 21 to 26 (EAP)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":3.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cinacalcet","deltaMin":78.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":51,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Poland","Spain","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.amgentrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":19,"n":57},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Oedema peripheral","Urinary tract infection","Nausea","Fatigue"]}}
