Subject must have a diagnosis of primary or secondary warm Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (wAIHA) as documented by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) specific for anti-IgG or anti-IgA.\n2. Have failed or not tolerated at least one prior wAIHA treatment regimen, including steroids, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, MMF, danazol, vincristine, ESA or splenectomy (folate, iron or other supplements do not fulfill this criterion).\n3. Have haptoglobin \\<LLN or total bilirubin \\>ULN or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) \\>ULN.\n4. At screening, subject's hemoglobin level must be ≤9 g/dL OR if hemoglobin value \\>9 g/dL and \\<10 g/dL, subject must be on an allowed wAIHA treatment AND the subject must have documented symptoms related to anemia (e.g., weakness, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain).\n5. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥70.\n6. Subject's concurrent treatment for wAIHA may consist of no more than two of any of the following agents: azathioprine, steroids, ESAs, mycophenolate mofetil, dapsone or danazol at a stable dose\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject with other types of Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) (e.g., cold antibody AIHA, cold agglutinin syndrome, mixed type AIHA, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria).\n2. Subject has AIHA secondary to autoimmune disease, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lymphoid malignancy if the underlying disease is not stable or is not well-controlled on current therapy, per investigator medical judgement.\n3. Subject has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥135 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg, whether or not the subject is receiving anti-hypertensive treatment.\n4. Subject has one or more of the following laboratory abnormalities at screening: neutrophil count of \\<1,000/μL or platelet count of \\<30,000/μL, unless due to Evans syndrome; transaminase levels (i.e., alanine aminotransferase \\[ALT\\] or aspartate aminotransferase \\[AST\\]) \\>1.5 x ULN.\n5. Has documented active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or HIV infection.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Durable Hemoglobin Response","description":"Proportion of subjects achieving a hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL with an increase from Baseline in hemoglobin level of ≥ 2 g/dL on 3 consecutive available visits during the 24-week treatment period.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"A Hemoglobin Response by Week 24","description":"Proportion of subjects with a hemoglobin response by Week 24.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin Level of 2 g/dL or Greater","description":"Proportion of subjects with change from baseline in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or greater.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Hemoglobin From Baseline to End of Treatment","description":"Change in mean hemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.99","spread":"2.095"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.99","spread":"2.468"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Use of Rescue Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) Regimens Use After Week 4","description":"Proportion of subjects free of rescue AIHA regimens used after Week 4.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)","description":"Change from Baseline to Week 24 in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue scale (FACIT-F).
