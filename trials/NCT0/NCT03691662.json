Subjects diagnosed with glaucoma or OHT who meet eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will washout of their current topical IOP-lowering medication(s), if any. After completing the required washout period, subjects will return for Visit 2 (Baseline, Day 1). Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at baseline will be randomized to receive double-masked treatment for 3 months.\n\nApproximately 400 adult subjects and up to 30 pediatric subjects with glaucoma or OHT who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either:\n\n* DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution once daily and Vehicle once daily, or\n* Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% twice daily. The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution compared with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% in subjects with glaucoma or OHT through Month 3.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Week 1","timeFrame":"08:00, 10:00 and 16:00 at Week 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution 0.002% QD (20:00) and Vehicle QD (08:00)","deltaMin":19.4,"sd":0.23},{"arm":"Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% BID (20:00 & 08:00)","deltaMin":19.7,"sd":0.23}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":34,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":204},"commonTop":["Instillation site pain","Conjunctival hyperaemia","Photophobia","Vision blurred","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
