Treatment medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide will be inhaled once daily at one dose level, fluticasone propionate will be inhaled twice daily at one dose level. The study duration consists of a baseline period (5 weeks) and a treatment period (5 weeks). The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"PC20 AMP (Post-treatment Compared to Baseline)","timeFrame":"Baseline and 5 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ciclesonide","deltaMin":4.9,"sd":3.7},{"arm":"Fluticasone","deltaMin":5.2,"sd":2.1}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Netherlands"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20595155"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":["Urticaria","Common cold","Pain armpit","Inflammation of the throat"]}}
