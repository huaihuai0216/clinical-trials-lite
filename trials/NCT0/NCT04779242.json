Response is determined programmatically using investigator's assessment of the CABP symptoms. The severity of the participant's CABP symptoms was evaluated on a 4-point scale (absent, mild, moderate, or severe) based upon the CABP Subject Symptom Severity Guidance Framework for Investigator Assessment. An indeterminate response is defined as one that could not be adequately inferred because the participant was not assessed because they withdrew consent, or other specified reason. Clinical failure is defined as no improvement by at least 1 level in 2CABP symptoms, worsening of CABP symptom, alternative antibacterial treatment for CABP, discontinuation due to adverse event requiring alternative antibacterial treatment, or death","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"89.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"87.7","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.3","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"3.0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response at the Post Therapy Evaluation (PTE) Visit","description":"At the PTE Visit, the investigator indicates one of the following outcomes relating to the primary infection under study: Clinical Success: survival after completion of a test article regimen without receiving any systemic antibacterial therapy other than test article, resolution of signs/symptoms of the infection present at Screening with no new symptoms/complications attributable to CABP and no need for further antibacterial therapy.
