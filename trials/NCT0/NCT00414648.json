It results in the uncontrolled growth of an unusual type of smooth muscle cell in the lung. These cells invade lung tissue, including the airways, blood vessels, and lymph vessels, and restrict the flow of air, blood, and lymph, respectively. Respiratory failure, lung collapse (pneumothorax), and pleural effusions (chylothorax) are hallmarks of the disease. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, in stabilizing or improving lung function in people with LAM.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Changes in Forced Expiratory Volume in One-second (FEV1) Slope in Milliliters Per Month","timeFrame":"Baseline to Month 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sirolimus","deltaMin":1,"sd":2},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-12,"sd":2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":18},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["United States","Canada","Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34461049","29940164","16210669","29140122","27628078","21410393","26799509","30846465","24159565","25979023","36927115","21180274"],"seeAlso":["https://dm.hiidatacenter.org"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":46},"commonTop":["\"Infections and infestations - Other, specify\"","\"Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders - Other, specify\"","Mucositis oral","Pain","Diarrhea"]}}
