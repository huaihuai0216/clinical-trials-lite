Two drugs are being tested in this study. Lomustine is an approved oral chemotherapy that belongs to the class of drugs called alkylating agents. Cediranib is a new drug that has not yet been approved for this disease. This study will compare the use of lomustine with cediranib, cediranib alone or lomustine with placebo (\"inactive substance\") to see whether the combination or cediranib alone will be more effective than the chemotherapy alone (lomustine) in preventing the growth of cancer cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression Free Survival (PFS)","timeFrame":"Baseline at 6 weeks and then every 6 weeks to discontinuation","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cediranib 30mg","deltaMin":92,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cediranib 20mg+ Lomustine 110mg","deltaMin":125,"sd":null},{"arm":"Lomustine 110mg","deltaMin":82,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":62,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Canada","Czechia","France","Germany","Netherlands","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23940216"],"seeAlso":["http://filehosting.pharmacm.com/DownloadService.ashx?client=CTR_MED_6111&studyid=425&filename=CSR-D8480C00055.pdf"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":55,"n":128},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Fatigue","Hypertension","Thrombocytopenia","Headache"]}}
