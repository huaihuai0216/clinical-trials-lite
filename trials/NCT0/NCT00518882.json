The aim of this trial is to compare the effect on glycaemic control of liraglutide or exenatide when added to subject's ongoing OAD (oral anti-diabetic drug) treatment of either metformin, sulphonylurea or a combination of both in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Two trial periods: A 26 week randomised, followed by a 52 week extension (14 + 38 weeks) where all subjects received liraglutide + OAD after previous randomisation to either liraglutide or exenatide, both combined with OAD treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycosylated A1c (HbA1c) at Week 26","timeFrame":"week 0, week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Liraglutide -> Liraglutide -> Liraglutide","deltaMin":-1.12,"sd":0.08},{"arm":"Exenatide -> Liraglutide -> Liraglutide","deltaMin":-0.79,"sd":0.08}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":125,"countries":["United States","Austria","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Ireland","North Macedonia","Norway","Poland","Puerto Rico","Romania","Slovenia","Spain","Sweden","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19245711","19491536","19515413","20332351","21388442","21450987","22018679","22055210","22193143","21883806","22862847","23010561","23186975","25504028","26936426","24561125"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":23,"n":235},"commonTop":["Nausea","Nasopharyngitis","Diarrhoea","Headache","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
