Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir (SOF)+ribavirin (RBV), or placebo to match SOF+placebo to match RBV. Randomization was stratified by presence/absence of cirrhosis. Approximately 20% of participants may have had evidence of cirrhosis at screening.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving SVR12","timeFrame":"Post-treatment Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SOF+RBV","deltaMin":78,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":63,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","New Zealand","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25040192","23607593"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":207},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Nausea","Headache","Insomnia","Pruritus"]}}
