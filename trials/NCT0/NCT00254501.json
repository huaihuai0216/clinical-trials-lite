Studies have shown that when people with diabetes manage their disease better, they stay healthier. Our goal in this study is to help those with diabetes better manage their disease (self-care). We will compare two types of health insurance benefits in this study. We want to see if one set of benefits improves self-care more than the other one.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Hemoglobin A-1C From Baseline","timeFrame":"baseline and 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Usual Care Plus Out-of-pocket Cost Waiver","deltaMin":-0.16,"sd":0.42},{"arm":"Pharmacists Consults Plus Out-of-pocket Cost Waiver","deltaMin":-0.5,"sd":0.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0757"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["21987530"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":31},"commonTop":[]}}
