Participants will either get oral semaglutide or sitagliptin - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will get 2 tablets a day to take first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Only 1 tablet has study medicine in it. The other tablet is a dummy medicine (placebo). After taking the semaglutide tablet, participants may not eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes, participants must take the sitagliptin tablet. Then participants can have their first meal of the day and take any other medicines they may need, including their metformin. The study will last for about 7 months (33 weeks). Participants will have 8 clinic visits and 1 phone call with the study doctor. At all 8 of the clinic visits, participants will have blood samples taken.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week 26 in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) (%)","timeFrame":"From baseline to week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 3 mg","deltaMin":-0.8,"sd":1},{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 7 mg","deltaMin":-1.3,"sd":1},{"arm":"Oral Semaglutide 14 mg","deltaMin":-1.6,"sd":1},{"arm":"Sitagliptin 100 mg","deltaMin":-0.7,"sd":1}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"0.0078"},{"comp":"OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":93,"countries":["Algeria","Brazil","China","Czechia","Hong Kong","Romania","Serbia","South Africa","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38985161"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":361},"commonTop":["Nausea","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Decreased appetite","Lipase increased"]}}
