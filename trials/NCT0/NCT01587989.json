Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks plus oral methotrexate 15-25 mg weekly for 12 weeks. Patients with a good/moderate EULAR response will then be randomized to receive either RoActemra/Actemra plus methotrexate or RoActemra/Actemra plus placebo for the following 12 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 months.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in DAS28","timeFrame":"Weeks 12 and 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group A: TCZ + MTX","deltaMin":0.17,"sd":0.83},{"arm":"Group B: TCZ + Placebo","deltaMin":-0.16,"sd":1.13}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.188"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.015"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.304"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":13,"countries":["Austria"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":32},"commonTop":["Alanine aminotransferase increased","Nausea","Leukopenia","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
