The testicular volume was measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes. The mean change from Day 1 in log-transformed testicular volume was analyzed using a mixed model with a fixed effect for time point and a random effect for the participant. For each time point, the mean change from Day 1 to that time point and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The geometric mean fold change in testicular volume and its 95% CI was obtained by exponentiation.","paramType":"GEOMETRIC_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.3","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Anti-Corifollitropin Alfa Antibodies","description":"Blood samples were collected for assessment of anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies in the pretreatment phase at Week -16 and Week -1; during the combined treatment phase at Weeks 4, 16, 28, 50, 52; and at the post-treatment follow-up visit, which could occur from Week 53 up to Week 57.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Induced Spermatogenesis Resulting in a Sperm Count ≥1x10^6/mL at or Before Week 52","description":"Semen samples were produced by masturbation after at least 48 hours of sexual abstinence and collected for evaluation in the pretreatment phase at Week -1, and during the combined treatment phase at Weeks 16, 28, 40, and 52.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"77.8","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Oestradiol increased","Headache","Blood testosterone increased","Blood testosterone decreased"]}}}
