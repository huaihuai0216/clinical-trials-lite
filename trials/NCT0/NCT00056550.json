This only applies to female surgical patients (not scheduled for cesarean section) of childbearing potential.\n* Are able to comply with the requirements of the study protocol.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have a diagnosis of hereditary APC resistance, Factor V Leiden, Protein S or C deficiency, prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A), or acquired (lupus anticoagulant) thrombophilic disorder.\n* Patients who are scheduled for a neurosurgical procedure or open-heart surgery.\n* Patients who have an underlying medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, could complicate the assessment of the incidence of DVT.\n* Patients who have a known allergy to goats or goat products.\n* Patients who have participated in a study employing an investigational drug within 30 days of the start of their participation in the current trial.\n* Patients using fondaparinux sodium, or are expected to be treated with fondaparinux sodium during the study period.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Incidence of Thromboembolic Events Acute Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) and/or Thromboembolic Events Other Than Acute Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).","description":"Observation for clinical signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events are evaluated for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using duplex ultrasonography and/or other imaging tests to confirm clinical signs/symptoms.
