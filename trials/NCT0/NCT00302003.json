Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving them together with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event Free Survival Without Receiving Radiation Therapy (EFSnoRT).","timeFrame":"At 60 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1","deltaMin":0.49,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":14,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37505794","35763667"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":278},"commonTop":["Febrile neutropenia","Infections and infestations - Other, specify","Nausea","Vomiting","Neutrophil count decreased"]}}
