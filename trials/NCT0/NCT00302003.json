This differs from traditional EFS in that relapse after AVPC\\* x3 therapy alone that does not place the patient in a higher risk category is not considered a treatment failure. In this definition, higher-risk relapse refers to relapse involving sites and extent of disease that place the patient in the current COG definition of intermediate or high-risk disease. If a patient with CR who experiences a LR relapse is not retreated with protocol-mandated chemotherapy and IFRT, subsequent disease relapses will nevertheless be counted in the analysis of the treatment strategy.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.89","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Event Free Survival (EFS)","description":"Survival is defined as the minimum time from study entry to a relapse of any kind, death from any cause, or occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm.
