The target population for intravenous selexipag includes those PAH patients who are hospitalized and are unable to swallow tablets of Uptravi.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess whether it is safe for patients with PAH to temporarily change from selexipag tablets (Uptravi®) to selexipag given directly into a vein (intravenous selexipag), and then switching back to the initial oral dose of selexipag.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE)","timeFrame":"From Day 1 to Day 37","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Selexipag","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33536021"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":20},"commonTop":["Headache","Nausea","Infusion Site Erythema","Oedema Peripheral","Flushing"]}}
