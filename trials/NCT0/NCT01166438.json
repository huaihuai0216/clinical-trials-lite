The patient may have tried other non-pharmacologic treatments for urge incontinence, such as supervised behavioral therapy, supervised physical therapy, unsupervised physical therapy, supervised biofeedback, and transvaginal electrical stimulation.\n* Subject has undergone 3-week washout period if subject were on anticholinergic therapy prior to enrollment.\n* Subject is able to complete all study related items and interviews.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any previous therapy with trospium chloride, solifenacin, or darifenacin\n* Failed three or more anticholinergic drugs.\n* Contraindication to anticholinergic therapy, specifically with solifenacin or trospium.\n* Current symptomatic urinary tract infection that has not resolved prior to randomization.\n* Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma\n* Gastric retention\n* Baseline need for intermittent self catheterization\n* PVR \\>150ml on 2 occasions with void(s) of greater than 150ml\n* Surgical treatment for stress incontinence (sling, Burch or urethral injection) or pelvic organ prolapse recommended or planned at enrollment by study investigator(s).\n* Any prior intra-detrusor botulinum toxin A injections\n* Previous or currently implanted neuromodulation (sacral or tibial).\n* Surgically altered detrusor muscle, such as augmentation cystoplasty.\n* Known allergy to botulinum toxin A.\n* Women with known neurologic disease believed to potentially affect urinary function (Multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, myasthenia gravis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease).\n* Known allergy to lidocaine.\n* Currently pregnant or lactating patients or patients planning pregnancy within the next year.\n* Sexually active premenopausal women with a uterus who have either not had a tubal ligation or are not on a medically approved form of contraception for at least 3 months prior to and throughout the duration of the study.\n* Cystoscopic findings that preclude injection, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Current or prior bladder malignancy.\n* In the opinion of the investigator, inability to understand diary instructions and complete 3-day voiding diary.\n* Subjects who are on anticoagulant therapy,excluding aspirin\n* Subject has been previously diagnosed with interstitial cystitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome.\n* Subjects with hematuria who have not undergone a clinically appropriate evaluation.\n* Subjects taking aminoglycosides at the time of injection.\n* Serum creatinine level greater than twice the upper limit of normal within the previous year.\n* Two or more hospitalizations for medical conditions in the previous year.\n* Plans to move out of area in the next 6 months.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"21 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Episodes","description":"Change from baseline in mean number of UUI episodes over 6 month double-blind period.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.13","spread":"0.2851"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.15","spread":"0.2761"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.32","spread":"0.2854"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.25","spread":"0.2762"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.22","spread":"0.2854"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.55","spread":"0.278"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.36","spread":"0.2857"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.40","spread":"0.2766"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.42","spread":"0.2881"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.49","spread":"0.2777"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.27","spread":"0.2864"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.33","spread":"0.2775"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Score on OABq-SF","description":"Values for the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form (OABq-SF) are changes from baseline in the adjusted mean scores for months 1 to 6.
