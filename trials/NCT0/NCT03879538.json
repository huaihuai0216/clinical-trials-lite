Both groups will undergo inhalation therapy for a duration of 2 hours via an FDA-approved mask breathing circuit. Vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate) will be monitored every 30 minutes. Pulse oximetry monitoring will be continuous. Patients will be monitored for side effects including nausea, vomiting, desaturation, sedation, respiratory depression, and dizziness. Patients and other involved providers will be blinded to the treatment type.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pain Score","timeFrame":"one-week and one-month follow-up time points","effectByArm":[{"arm":"The Nitrous Oxide Group","deltaMin":5.9,"sd":1.5},{"arm":"The Control Group","deltaMin":6,"sd":2.5}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.19"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":20},"commonTop":[]}}
