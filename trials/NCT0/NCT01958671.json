This trial consists of a run-in period of 3 to 11 weeks, a 26-week placebo-controlled treatment period (Phase A), and a 26-week active treatment period (Phase B). The primary hypotheses of the trial are that at Week 26, the mean reduction from baseline in hemoglobin A1c (A1C) for 15 mg ertugliflozin is greater than that for placebo and the mean reduction from baseline in A1C for 5 mg ertugliflozin is greater than that for placebo.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline In A1C at Week 26","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 5 mg","deltaMin":-0.79,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ertugliflozin 15 mg","deltaMin":-0.96,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["28116776","34213819","32700393","32648108","32372382","32324082","32324065","31797522","31064361","29419917"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":156},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Vulvovaginal mycotic infection"]}}
