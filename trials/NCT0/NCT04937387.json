Six attributes are measured with a patient-completed questionnaire, and the questions are designed to be self-completed by the participant. The six patient-reported questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The recall period is the past week. The seventh attribute of the ACQ-7 is lung function (FEV1%-predicted) which was assessed via study visit spirometry. All 7 items of ACQ have response on 0-6 ordinal scale (0=no impairment/limitation, 6=total impairment/limitation). The total score is calculated as the average of all non-missing item responses, ranges from 0 to 6.
