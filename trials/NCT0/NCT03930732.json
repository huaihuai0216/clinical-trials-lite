At least one exacerbation should have occurred while the patient was taking inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long acting beta agonist (LABA)/long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (or LABA/LAMA if ICS is contraindicated).

One of the two required moderate exacerbations had to require the use of systemic corticosteroids. Severe exacerbations were recorded by the investigator and defined as AECOPD requiring hospitalization or observation \\>24 hours in emergency department/urgent care facility.\n  * Background triple therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA) for 3 months prior to randomization with a stable dose of medication for ≥1 month prior to Visit 1; Double therapy (LABA + LAMA) allowed if ICS was contraindicated.\n* Evidence of Type 2 inflammation: Patients with blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/microliter at Visit 1.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\n* COPD diagnosis for less than 12 months prior to randomization.\n* A current diagnosis of asthma or history of asthma according to the 2018 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines or other accepted guidelines.\n* Significant pulmonary disease other than COPD (e.g., lung fibrosis, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiectasis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome etc) or another diagnosed pulmonary or systemic disease associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts.\n* Cor pulmonale, evidence of right cardiac failure.\n* Treatment with oxygen of more than 12 hours per day.\n* Hypercapnia requiring Bi-level ventilation.\n* AECOPD as defined in inclusion criteria within 4 weeks prior to screening, or during the screening period.\n* Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to screening, or during the screening period.\n* History of, or planned pneumonectomy or lung volume reduction surgery.
