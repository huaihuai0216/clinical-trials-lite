An LCI of 7.5 and below is normal; values greater than 7.5 are abnormal. LCI is able to detect abnormalities in lung function earlier than more traditional modalities such as spirometry.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.74","spread":"0.18"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.35","spread":"0.19"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":120},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Cough","Nasopharyngitis","Pyrexia","Headache"]}}}
