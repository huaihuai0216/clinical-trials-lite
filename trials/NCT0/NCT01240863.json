Withdrawal severity was classified, based on the total score, as follows:\n\n* 0 to 4=normal\n* 5 to 12=mild\n* 13 to 24=moderate\n* 25 to 36=moderately severe\n* \\>36=severe","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.5","spread":"0.90"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.5","spread":"0.90"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.8","spread":"1.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.7","spread":"1.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.5","spread":"0.92"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.8","spread":"1.58"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":"1.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7","spread":"1.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.6","spread":"1.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.5","spread":"0.92"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.8","spread":"1.76"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.7","spread":"1.13"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.1","spread":"2.02"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Addiction Behavior Checklist (ABC) Total Scores During Both the Open-Label Titration and Double-Blind Treatment Periods","description":"The ABC was a clinician rated scale that consisted of a brief (20 item) questionnaire designed to track behaviors characteristic of addiction related to prescription opioid medications in chronic pain populations.
