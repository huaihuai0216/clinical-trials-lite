UPDRS Part III has 14 items assessing motor skills including facial expression and speech, tremors, rigidity, posture, gait, and bradykinesia. Left and right sides (arms, legs, and hands) are assessed separately for seven of the functions. A summary score ranging from 0 to 108 is generated by adding the 14 specific motor function responses. The motor function (UPDRS part III) assessments are done by turning on the stimulation with and without taking PD medications (on/off) at each in-person visit. The higher score indicates that the condition is worse.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-12.3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.7","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":49,"n":121},"commonTop":["Fall","Dyskinesia","Gait disturbance","Tremor","Motor Dysfunction"]}}}
