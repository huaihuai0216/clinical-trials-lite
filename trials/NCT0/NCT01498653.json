Informed Consent: All subjects must be able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study\n2. Type of Subject: Outpatients, of Asian ancestry, 12 years of age or older at Visit 1 (or ≥18 years of age or older if local regulations or the regulatory status of study medication permit enrolment of adults only) with a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma \\[GINA, 2009\\] at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n3. Gender: Male or Eligible Female, defined as non-childbearing potential or childbearing potential using an acceptable method of birth control consistently and correctly\n4. Severity of Disease: A best FEV1 of 40%-90% of the predicted normal value at the Visit 1 Screening visit. Predicted values will be based upon NHANES III using the Asian adjustment\n5. Reversibility of Disease: Demonstrated ≥12% and ≥200mL reversibility of FEV1 within 10-40minutes following 2-4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (or one nebulized treatment with albuterol/salbutamol solution) at the Screening Visit.\n6. Current Anti-Asthma Therapy: All subjects must be using an ICS, with or without LABA, for at least 12 weeks prior to Visit 1.\n7. Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current short-acting beta2-agonists with albuterol/salbutamol inhaler at Visit 1 for use as needed for the duration of the study. Subjects must be able to withhold albuterol/salbutamol for at least 4 hours prior to study visits.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. History of Life-threatening asthma: Defined for this protocol as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory arrest or hypoxic seizures within the last 10 years.\n2. Respiratory Infection: Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear that is not resolved within 4 weeks of Visit 1 and led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate in the study.\n3. Asthma Exacerbation: Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 12 weeks of Visit 1 or that resulted in overnight hospitalization requiring additional treatment for asthma within 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n4. Concurrent Respiratory Disease: A subject must not have current evidence of pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pulmonary fibrotic disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or other respiratory abnormalities other than asthma.\n5. Other Concurrent Diseases/Abnormalities: A subjects must not have any clinically significant, uncontrolled condition or disease state that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through study participation or would confound the interpretation of the efficacy results if the condition/disease exacerbated during the study.\n6. Oropharyngeal Examination: A subject will not be eligible for the Run-in if he/she has clinical visual evidence of candidiasis at Visit 1.\n7. Allergies:\n\n   * Drug Allergy: Any adverse reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any beta2-agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any intranasal, inhaled, or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Known or suspected sensitivity to the constituents of the new powder inhaler\n   * Milk Protein Allergy: History of severe milk protein allergy.\n8. Concomitant Medications: Use of the protocol defined prohibited medications within the prohibited time intervals prior to Screening (Visit 1) or during the study.\n9. Tobacco Use: Current smoker or a smoking history of 10 pack years (e.g., 20 cigarettes/day for 10 years). A subject may not have used inhaled tobacco products within the past 3 months (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, smokeless or pipe tobacco).\n10. Affiliation with Investigator's Site: A subject will not be eligible for this study if he/she is an immediate family member of the participating Investigator, sub Investigator, study coordinator, or employee of the participating Investigator.\n11. Previous Participation: A subject may not have previously been randomized to treatment in another Phase III FF/VI combination product study\n12. Compliance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location which seems likely (in the opinion of the Investigator ) to impair compliance with any aspect of this study protocol, including visit schedule and completion of the daily diaries","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Change From Baseline (BL) in Daily Evening (PM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Averaged Over the 12-week Treatment Period","description":"Peak Expiratory Flow is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated.
