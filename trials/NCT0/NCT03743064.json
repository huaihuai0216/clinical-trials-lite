The main question it aimed to answer was as follows: Do patients who receive anamorelin HCl gain more body weight and show more improvement in anorexia symptoms than those who receive placebo.\n\nApproximately 316 patients were to be enrolled in the study. Of these patients, an equal number were to be assigned to each treatment group (anamorelin HCl or placebo). Participants were to take their assigned study drug by mouth once daily for a total of 24 weeks. During this treatment period, the patients were to visit the clinical study site every 3 weeks for health and other study-related assessments. Two weeks after the last treatment, patients were to receive a follow-up phone call.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change From Baseline in Body Weight Over 12 Weeks","timeFrame":"Mean change from baseline over 12 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"100 mg Anamorelin HCl","deltaMin":1.822,"sd":0.263},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":0.538,"sd":0.25}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":65,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Croatia","Poland","Romania","Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":44,"n":154},"commonTop":["Anaemia","Asthenia","Nausea","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Dyspnoea"]}}
