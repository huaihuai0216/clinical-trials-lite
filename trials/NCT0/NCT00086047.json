The purpose of this study is to determine whether coping skills training, when combined with usual medical care, can reduce pain and disability in adolescents with fibromyalgia.\n\nStudy hypotheses: 1) Adolescents who receive coping skills training combined with their usual medical care will show significantly greater reductions in functional disability, pain, and depressive symptoms at the end of the acute treatment phase than adolescents who receive fibromyalgia education with their usual medical care. 2) Adolescents who receive coping skills training with their usual medical care will show significantly lower levels of functional disability, pain, and depressive symptoms at the end of a six-month maintenance phase than adolescents who receive fibromyalgia education with their usual medical care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in FDI (Functional Disability Inventory) Scores at End of Study","timeFrame":"Baseline and 6 months (end of study)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Coping Skills Training","deltaMin":21.4,"sd":9.4},{"arm":"Fibromyalgia Education","deltaMin":19.2,"sd":8.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.007"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"11 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":3,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22108765","23686969"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":57},"commonTop":[]}}
