The knee with the PJR/TJR is not to be injected with CNTX-4975-05.\n\nFor subjects for bilateral knee injection, the index knee must have moderate to severe pain at screening associated with OA, and greater pain in the index knee than in the contralateral knee. Their pain must be stable for a minimum of 6 months prior to Screening, as assessed by the investigator. The index knee in these subjects is the one with the worst pain with walking. Where both knees have equal pain with walking, then the knee on the subject's dominant side will be designated the index knee.\n\nFor qualifying knee pain with walking, subjects will use an NPRS (0-10; 0=no pain, 10=worst possible pain) to rate their knee pain with walking (both knees, except knees with PJR/TJR). The PJR/TJR pain should be rated using the NPRS scale, but will not be a qualifying pain score.\n\n* Body mass index â‰¤45 kg/m\\^2.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Joint replacement surgery of the index knee at any time, or open surgery of the index knee in the past 24 months. Joint replacement of the contralateral knee is permitted for subjects who will not receive an injection in the contralateral (natural) knee.\n* Prior arthroscopic surgery of the index knee within 6 months of Screening.\n* Any painful conditions of the index knee due to joint disease other than OA. Radicular or referred pain involving the index knee or from joint disease other than OA involving the index knee, such as, but not restricted to chondromalacia patellae, inflammatory disease, metabolic diseases, gout/pseudogout, hemochromatosis, acromegaly, etc.\n* Periarticular pain from any cause, including referred pain, bursitis, tendonitis, soft tissue tenderness, or subacute/acute pain from injury.\n* Other chronic pain anywhere in the body that requires the use of chronic analgesic medications, including, but not limited to, local painful areas, myofascial pain syndromes, fibromyalgia, genetic, metabolic abnormalities, hematologic, or neuropathic pain.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","maximumAge":"95 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Determination of Optimal Procedure for Administering CNTX-4975-05 With Regards to Pain, Participant Satisfaction, and Investigator's Satisfaction","description":"A composite score was calculated for each of the 5 treatment regimens by summing the scores of three assessments: (1) procedure pain 30 minutes after injection of CNTX-4975-05 on a 0-4 scale, 0 was best indicating no procedure pain, 4 was worst indicating severe procedure pain; (2) assessment of subjects' satisfaction with the regimen on a scale of 1 (completely dissatisfied) to 7 (completely satisfied), 1 was worst and 7 was best; and (3) assessment of investigators' satisfaction with the regimen on a scale of 1 (completely dissatisfied) to 7 (completely satisfied), 1 was worst and 7 was best.\n\nThe procedure pain at 30 minutes was reversed to a 1-7 scale so 7 was best indicating no procedure pain and 1 was worst indicating severe procedure pain.
