The purpose of this study is to compare a 6-week course to a 6-month course of the drug valganciclovir in babies born with CMV to assess the safety and efficacy of this treatment. Participants will include 104 infants (30 days old or younger) born with CMV disease. All infants will take valganciclovir by mouth for 6 weeks. At the end of the 6 week period, subjects will be assigned by chance to receive either valganciclovir or placebo (inactive substance) to complete the 6 months of antiviral treatment. Patients will be followed for the study related evaluations of safety, changes to hearing, and developmental milestones for up to 2 years. Patients will be followed by telephone contact for an additional 3 years. Thus, participants may be involved in study related procedures for approximately 5 years.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Best Ear Hearing Assessments at 6 Months.","timeFrame":"Between baseline and 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo: 6 Wks Valganciclovir Followed by 18 Wks Placebo","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Valganciclovir: 24 Wks of Valganciclovir","deltaMin":5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["United States","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25738669"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":13},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Neutropenia","Otitis media","Diarrhoea","Rash"]}}
