It is estimated that about 5% of all patients with diabetes present a history of foot ulceration, while the lifetime risk of diabetic patients developing this complication is 15%. The majority (60-80%) of foot ulcers will heal, while 10-15% of them will remain active, and 5-24% of them will finally lead to limb amputation within a period of 6-18 months after the first evaluation , 2 out of 3 patients with a limb amputation could also be involved in a new amputation in the next year; higher or in the other leg , Eighty-five percent of lower-limb amputations in patients with diabetes are preceded by foot ulceration. The management of chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) suggests multi-disciplinary approaches including control of diabetes, orthotic shoe wear, off-loading device, wound care and surgery in selected cases. However, treatment of DFU remains challenging because of unsatisfactory results from surgical and non-surgical treatments. Many adjunctive therapies are designed to improve the care of DFU including negative pressure wound therapy , ultrasound, recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rPDGF-BB) Hyperbaric oxygen and acellular matrix product among others.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Biopsies","timeFrame":"75 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Active Comparator: Chitosan","deltaMin":2.46,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"Active Comparator: Isosorbide Dinitrate Spray","deltaMin":2.64,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"Combination: IDS and Chitosan","deltaMin":2.56,"sd":0.6},{"arm":"Placebo Comparator: Placebo","deltaMin":2.07,"sd":0.6}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["22529027","9777967","21135797","21873346","9142149","19338582","18456858","19043221","17073842","12610079","10354076"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":[]}}
