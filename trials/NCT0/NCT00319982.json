Please note that the total duration on treatment varied between study subjects to maximize time on treatment for the trial. Specifically, subjects that enrolled earliest had the longest duration of treatment; those who enrolled latest had the shortest duration of treatment with a minimum treatment duration of 1 year. All analyses examine the final study visit on treatment to the baseline visit.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.06","spread":"0.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.21","spread":"0.42"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Safety and Tolerability of Diltiazem Treatment","description":"Adverse events were compared between participants assigned to diltiazem and those assigned to placebo","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"10","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"12","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Impact of Diltiazem on Heart Rate","description":"Change in Value (Difference between Final and Baseline Visits)","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.9","spread":"2.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.0","spread":"2.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Left Ventricular Cavity Size","description":"Change in Left Ventricular End-Diastolic Diameter z-score (Final Value - Baseline Value)","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.60","spread":"0.17"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.53","spread":"0.16"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Development of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy","description":"The number of participants who developed overt left ventricular hypertrophy during the duration of the trial was analyzed","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Adherence to Study Medication","description":"Adherence to study medication was assessed by pill count","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"83","spread":"10.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"90","spread":"6.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Impact of Diltiazem on Systolic Blood Pressure","description":"Change in Value (Difference between Final and Baseline Visits)","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.4","spread":"1.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2.1","spread":"1.8"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":18},"commonTop":["Lightheadeness","Shortness of Breath","Nausea/GI distress","Chest Pain","Fatigue"]}}}
