Surgery often serves as the initial event for opioid-na√Øve patients to obtain a prescription for opioids and spiral into misuse and addiction. From the perspective of perioperative care clinicians, the answer to the opioid crisis may be using opioid-free analgesia. However, the number of comparative studies in this field is limited and existing small trials do not reflect current standards of care in North America. Lack of evidence means that the decision to prescribe opioids after outpatient surgery largely depends on surgeon preference and healthcare culture. Hence, there is an urgent need for a robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) to guide clinical decision-making. The feasibility and optimal design of this RCT should be informed by a pilot trial. The overarching goal of this pilot RCT is to investigate the feasibility of conducting a full-scale RCT to assess the comparative-effectiveness of opioid versus opioid-free analgesia after outpatient general surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Screened Participants Who Were Eligible to Participate in the Study","timeFrame":"4 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Total Number of Screened Patients","deltaMin":163,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":["35849399"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":39},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Constipation","Headache","Abdominal distention","Diarrhea"]}}
