This study demonstrates that PwH have an increased risk of fracture compared to the general population and that the issue of bone health will increase in importance as the PwH population ages.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Bone Biomarker Density (BMD)","timeFrame":"5 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Open Label","deltaMin":-0.74,"sd":1.22}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["16460432","19220727","19187193","17212729","15286254","8208906","18275434","16323100","24118364","22469061","23902277","16763463","14960673","214960"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":16},"commonTop":[]}}
