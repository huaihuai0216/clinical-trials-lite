The measure is the ratio of the sum of isovolumetric contraction time and isovolumetric relaxation time, divided by ventricular ejection time. A lower value is consistent with a more efficient ventricle (better function). A value of zero indicates that there is no isovolumetric contraction or relaxation and, while physiologically implausible, would be consistent with a perfectly efficient ventricle. The mean left ventricular MPI in healthy people without heart disease is approximately 0.35 while the mean right ventricular MPI is approximately 0.1 due to the reduced ventricular afterload of the pulmonary circulation. In general, a decrease in the MPI corresponds to more efficient (better) ventricular function, while an increase in MPI corresponds to less efficient (worse) ventricular function.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.02","spread":"0.112"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.01","spread":"0.132"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Log-transformed Reactive Hyperemia Index (InRH) From Baseline to Week 26","description":"Endothelial pulse amplitude tonometry (Endo-PAT) is a technique for the non-invasive assessment of peripheral vascular function.
