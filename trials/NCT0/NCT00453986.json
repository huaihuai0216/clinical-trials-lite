immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical examination.\n* A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, until the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.\n* History of reactions or allergic disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine.\n* Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.\n* Acute disease at the time of enrolment.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions.\n\nAdditional criteria for subjects receiving Fluarix™ co-administration:\n\n* History of hypersensitivity to a previous dose of influenza vaccine.\n* History of reactions
