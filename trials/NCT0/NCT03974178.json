The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Is the short-term fatality rate and failure rate associated with fexinidazole lower than those of melarsoprol in patients with stage 2 r-HAT?\n* Is the long-term failure rate associated with fexinidazole lower than that of melarsoprol in patients with stage 2 r-HAT?\n* Can fexinidazole in patients with stage 1 r-HAT replace the treatment with suramin?\n* Is fexinidazole treatment safe in patient with r-HAT, regardless of stage?\n\nParticipants will receive fexinidazole oral treatment for 10 days. Regular blood draws and lumbar punctures will be performed over 12 months to confirm the cure of the disease. Other assessments will include the recording of adverse events, signs and symptoms of the disease, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Evaluable Patients With Stage 2 r-HAT Who Died by the End of Hospitalization, Considering Only Deaths Possibly Related to r-HAT or Fexinidazole","timeFrame":"12 to 18 days after start of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Patients With Stage 2 r-HAT","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":"0.0488"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Malawi","Uganda"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40288400"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Vomiting","Electrocardiogram U-wave abnormality","Hypoalbuminaemia","Hypertension","Nausea"]}}
