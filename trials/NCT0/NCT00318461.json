This trial is designed to show the effect of treatment with liraglutide when adding to existing metformin therapy and to compare it with the effects of metformin monotherapy and combination therapy of metformin and glimepiride. Two trial periods: A 6 month (26 weeks) randomised, double-blinded period followed by an 18 months open-label extension, in total 2 years (104 weeks).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycosylated A1c (HbA1c) at Week 26","timeFrame":"week 0, week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lira 0.6 + Met","deltaMin":-0.69,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Lira 1.2 + Met","deltaMin":-0.97,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Lira 1.8 + Met","deltaMin":-1,"sd":0.07},{"arm":"Met Mono","deltaMin":0.09,"sd":0.09},{"arm":"Met + Glim","deltaMin":-0.98,"sd":0.07}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG004","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG004","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG004","p":"0.1026"},{"comp":"OG003 vs OG004","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":190,"countries":["Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Bulgaria","Croatia","Denmark","Germany","Hungary","India","Ireland","Italy","Netherlands","Norway","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","South Africa","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18931095","19245711","19491535","19491536","19878259","19930006","21450987","22055210","22193143","21883806","21883438","22985213","22862847","23010561","23186975","25504028","24561125","21209033"],"seeAlso":["http://novonordisk-trials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":36,"n":242},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Nausea","Headache","Diarrhoea","Back pain"]}}
