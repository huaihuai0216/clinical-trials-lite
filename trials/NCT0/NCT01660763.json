A pain intensity score of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain) is obtained before starting the study and throughout the 48 time period. The pain score at each assessment time is subtracted from the baseline pain score to provide the total sum score or SPID-48. A higher SPID-48 is better and indicates a reduction in pain intensity compared to the baseline score. Range of SPID48 scores were -239 to 417.\n\nTime-weighted SPID48 = ∑ \\[T(i) - T(i-1)\\] x PID(i), where T(0) = Time 0 (baseline), T(i) is the scheduled or unscheduled assessment time, and PID(i) is the PID score at time i for i=0 to 48 hours","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76.24","spread":"7.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-11.35","spread":"10.55"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":315},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Oxygen Saturation Decreased","Headache","Dizziness"]}}}
