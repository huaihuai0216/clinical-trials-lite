The subject has poor peripheral venous access.\n14. The subject has undergone whole blood collection of at least 200 mL within 4 weeks (28 days) or at least 400 mL within 12 weeks (84 days) prior to the start of study medication administration Period 1.\n15. The subject has undergone whole blood collection of at least 800 mL in total within 52 weeks (364 days) prior to the start of study medication administration in Period 1.\n16.

The subject has a screening or prior to the start of study medication administration on Day 1 in Period 1 hemoglobin level \\<12.5 g/dL.\n18. The subject has a screening or prior to the start of study medication administration on Day 1 in Period 1 abnormal (clinically significant) 12-lead ECG.\n19. Subject has abnormal screening or prior to the start of study medication administration on Day 1 in Period 1 laboratory values that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease or subject with the following lab abnormalities: ALT and/or AST \\>1.5 the upper limits of normal.\n20. Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"MALE","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"35 Years","stdAges":["ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"AUC (0-72): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 72 Hours Postdose for Unchanged SYR-322 (SYR-322Z)","description":"AUC (0-72) is measure of area under the curve from time 0 to 72 hours post dose.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1494.9","spread":"159.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1472.8","spread":"172.59"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"AUC (0-tlqc): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration for SYR-322Z","description":"AUC (0-tlqc) is a measure of total plasma exposure to the drug from Time 0 to Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC \\[0-tlqc\\]).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1494.9","spread":"159.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1472.8","spread":"172.59"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for SYR-322Z","description":"Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) is the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration, obtained directly from the plasma concentration-time curve.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"154.9","spread":"38.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"173.4","spread":"38.45"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for SYR-322Z","description":"Tmax: Time to reach the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), equal to time (hours) to Cmax.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.000","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.00","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"AUC (0-inf): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity for SYR-322Z","description":"AUC (0-inf) is a measure of total plasma exposure to the drug from time zero extrapolated to infinity.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1555.0","spread":"167.20"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1536.8","spread":"187.33"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Apparent Terminal Elimination Rate Constant (λz) for SYR-322Z","description":"Terminal elimination rate constant, calculated as the negative of the slope of the log-linear regression of the natural logarithm concentration-time curve during the terminal phase.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.03912","spread":"0.0046649"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.03673","spread":"0.0053316"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life (T1/2) for SYR-322Z","description":"Terminal phase elimination half-life (T1/2) is the time required for half of the drug to be eliminated from the plasma.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17.94","spread":"2.0527"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19.24","spread":"2.8931"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Apparent Clearance After Extra Vascular Administration (CL/F) for SYR-322Z","description":"CL/F is apparent clearance of the drug from the plasma, calculated as the drug dose divided AUC (0-inf), expressed in liter/hour (L/hr).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"16.24","spread":"1.6898"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.52","spread":"2.2647"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Mean Residence Time (MRT) for SYR-322Z","description":"Mean residence time (MRT) calculated as area under the first moment plasma concentration-time curve (AUMC \\[0-inf\\]) divided by AUC (0-inf).
