Treatment with valproate or hydroxyurea within 3-months of Screening. Any history of gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, or cell transplantation.\n* Ongoing medical condition that according to the Site Investigator would interfere with the conduct and assessments of the study. Examples are medical disability (e.g., wasting or cachexia, severe anemia, etc.) that would interfere with the assessment of safety or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study procedures.\n\nNOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"2 Years","maximumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale - Expanded (HFMSE) Score at Month 15","description":"The HFMSE consists of 33 scored activities used to assess motor function in children with SMA.
