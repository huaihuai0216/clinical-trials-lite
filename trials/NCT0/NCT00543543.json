The primary hypotheses tested in the study were 1) V503 administered to 16- to 26-year-old adolescents and young women is generally well-tolerated, 2) V503 reduces combined incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 31/33/45/52/58-related disease compared with GARDASIL, and 3) V503 induces non-inferior geometric mean titers for HPV Type 6/11/16/18 antibodies compared with GARDASIL.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Base Study: Combined Incidence of HPV Type 31/33/45/52/58-related Disease (Test of Hypothesis)","timeFrame":"From Day 1 until >=30 cases accumulate, up to Month 54 in the base study","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Mid-dose V503","deltaMin":0.5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gardasil","deltaMin":15.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["25912208","25693011","25278227","25749310","26366475","27422279","28886907","33326342","30982556","29767739","29269325","29211620","28789851"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":310},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site swelling","Injection site erythema","Headache","Nausea"]}}
