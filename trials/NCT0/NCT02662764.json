Male or female patients who were 18 years of age or older.\n2. Patients who were scheduled to undergo surgery under general or spinal anesthesia that does not include intrathecal opioids during the operation.\n3. Patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I - III (Appendix I).\n4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have been using an effective method of birth control at the time of screening visit and for 30 days following the end of the study period. Acceptable methods of birth control included oral or transdermal contraceptives, condom, spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), progestin implant or injection, abstinence, vaginal ring, or sterilization of partner. The reason for non-child bearing potential, such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or postmenopausal for \\> 1 year, was specified. Patients using hormonal forms of contraception were also willing to use a barrier method of contraception from screening through 30 days following the study period.\n5. Post-surgical patients who had been admitted to the PACU, and were expected to have acute pain requiring opioids for 24 - 72 hours after surgery.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients who had taken an opioid for more than 30 consecutive days, at a daily dose of 15 mg or more of morphine (or equivalent), within the past 3 months prior to surgery (e.g. more than 3 doses per day of Vicodin®, Norco®, Lortab® with 5 mg hydrocodone per tablet).\n2. Patients who were currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or had taken MAOIs within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n3. Patients with current sleep apnea that had been documented by a sleep laboratory study or were on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).\n4. Patients with an allergy or hypersensitivity to opioids.\n5. Patients who were currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or had taken MAOIs within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.\n6. Patients with current sleep apnea that had been documented by a sleep laboratory study or were on home continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).\n7. Patients who were receiving oxygen therapy at the time of screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
