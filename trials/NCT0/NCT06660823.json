(Majority of our patients falls in this age group 45-70 years, below these patients are relatively young and usually do not show delayed recovery or prolonged ventilation, while above 70 years are considered frail and more vulnerable to anesthetic medications, so we preferred to exclude them)\n\n  * Sex: Both sexes\n  * Elective, urgent and emergency open heart surgeries. (Most of urgent and emergency cases are either mechanical valve thrombosis or aortic dissection patients, and are more prone to prolonged mechanical ventilation and delayed recovery compared to elective patients)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* • Patients refuse to give informed consent.\n\n  * Patient younger than 45 years old, older than 70 years old.\n  * Off pump patients.\n  * Patients known hypothyroidism on levothyroxine supplementation.\n  * Patients known hyperthyroidism on Carbimazole.\n  * Those developing any form of arrhythmia L-Thyroxine will be stopped immediately and the patient will be excluded from the study.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"45 Years","maximumAge":"70 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) From Intervention Initiation to ICU Discharge (Δ)","description":"The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) assesses conscious level through three components:\n\nEye response (scored 1-4):\n\n4: Opens eyes spontaneously\n\n3: Opens eyes to verbal command\n\n2: Opens eyes to pain\n\n1: No eye opening\n\nVerbal response (scored 1-5):\n\n5: Oriented and converses\n\n4: Confused\n\n3: Inappropriate words\n\n2: Incomprehensible sounds\n\n1: No verbal response\n\nMotor response (scored 1-6):\n\n6: Obeys commands\n\n5: Localizes to pain\n\n4: Withdraws from pain\n\n3: Abnormal flexion (decorticate)\n\n2: Abnormal extension (decerebrate)\n\n1: No motor response\n\nThe total GCS score ranges from 3 (worst) to 15 (best), with higher scores indicating better neurological function.
