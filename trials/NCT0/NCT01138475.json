Subject has previously been on active vitamin D therapy (calcitriol, paricalcitol, doxercalciferol, alfacalcidol) within the 30-day washout period prior to the Treatment Period at doses greater than 1200 IU of vitamin D3 or equivalent.\n\n  2\\. Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to paricalcitol or to drugs similar to the study drug (i.e., vitamin D or vitamin D related compounds).\n\n  3\\. Pregnant (confirmed by screening pregnancy test) or lactating females. 4. Subject is expected to initiate renal replacement therapy within one year. 5. Known history of hypercalcemia (\\>10.5 mg/dl), hyperphosphatemia (\\>6 mg/dl) primary hyperparathyroidism, or history of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy.\n\n  6\\. Full remission from a malignancy for less than one year (except completely excised non-Melanoma skin cancer e.g., basal or squamous carcinoma) or any history of bone metastasis.\n\n  7\\. Subject has co-morbid conditions (e.g., advanced malignancy, advanced liver disease) with a life expectancy less than 1 year.\n\n  8\\. Subject has received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration or is currently enrolled in another clinical trial.\n\n  9\\. Subject has a history of active kidney stones within the 2 years prior to the Screening Period.\n\n  10\\. Subject has poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure \\> 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure \\> 110 mmHg at the Screening Visit (confirmed by repeat).\n\n  11\\. Subject has history of renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism or pheochromocytoma, 12. Subject is taking calcitonin, bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, glucocorticoids (except topical or inhaled glucocorticoids), or other drugs that may affect calcium or bone metabolism, other than aluminum, calcium and non-calcium containing phosphate binders or female subjects on stable (same dose and product for three months) estrogen and/or progestin therapy.\n\n  13\\. Subject is currently receiving immunosuppressant therapy and/or high doses (non-maintenance therapy) of glucocorticoids (\\> 5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent).\n\n  14\\. Subject has had acute renal failure within 12 weeks of the Screening Phase defined by an acute rise in serum Cr (of at least 0.5 mg/dL or 44 micromoles/L) to more than 4 g/dL (350 micromoles/L).\n\n  15\\. Subject is known to be HIV positive. 16. Use of known inhibitors (i.e., ketoconazole) or inducers (i.e., carbamazepine) of cytochrome P450 3 A (CYP3 A) within two weeks prior to study drug administration.\n\n  17\\. For any reason, subject is considered by the Investigator to be an unsuitable candidate to receive paricalcitol capsules or is put at risk by study procedures.\n\n  18\\. Subject has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within six months prior to screening.\n\n  19\\. Subject has had a liver or kidney transplant. 20.
