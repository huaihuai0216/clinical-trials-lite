The primary hypothesis is that the percentage of participants achieving SVR12 in the grazoprevir plus elbasvir treatment arm is non-inferior to that in the SOF plus PR treatment arm.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary: Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Virologic Response at 12 Weeks After the End of All Treatment (SVR12)","timeFrame":"12 weeks after end of all therapy (Study Week 24)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Grazoprevir + Elbasvir","deltaMin":99.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"SOF + PR","deltaMin":90.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["27542322","30587935","29461687","29404492","29344726"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":129},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Headache","Fatigue","Asthenia","Influenza like illness"]}}
