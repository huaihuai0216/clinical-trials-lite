Many of these smokers may benefit from prescription treatment alternatives, including Zyban or Chantix. In this study, the investigators propose to develop and evaluate a stepped-care treatment algorithm that would evaluate whether smokers who receive treatment with NRT should be supplemented with Zyban or switched to Chantix only based on: 1) their initial response to NRT; and 2) individual genetic factors found to predict smoking cessation in other studies evaluating these treatments. This study is a continuation of our previous studies showing that abstinence rates can be increased by starting nicotine patch therapy two weeks before the quit date. The investigators will provide pre-cessation NRT to all participants initially. Those who do not show a favorable response on early indicators of success (e.g., smoking in the first week after the target quit-smoking date) will receive \"rescue\" treatment by having their NRT treatment supplemented with Zyban , by being switched to treatment with Chantix or will remain on NRT (control).\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that \"Rescue\" treatment with Zyban in combination with NRT or Chantix will increase success rates over leaving subjects on NRT when they are NRT insufficient responders, i.e. they have shown an unfavorable response to NRT in the first week pre-quit or the first week post-quit.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Continuous 4-week Abstinence From Smoking Between Weeks 8-11 After the Quit Date (Through the End of Treatment)","timeFrame":"weeks 8-11 after quit date","effectByArm":[{"arm":"NRT Responder","deltaMin":59.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pre-Quit Randomization to Bupropion + NRT","deltaMin":28.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pre-Quit Randomization to Varenicline","deltaMin":23.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Pre-Quit Randomization to NRT","deltaMin":16,"sd":null},{"arm":"Post-Quit Randomization to Bupropion + NRT","deltaMin":26.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Post-Quit Randomized to Varenicline","deltaMin":37.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Post-Quit Randomized to NRT","deltaMin":26.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":35},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37230961","37142273","23640009","23128154"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":132},"commonTop":["VIVID DREAMS","ITCHING/BURNING AT PATCH SITE","INSOMNIA","THIRST","IRRITABILITY"]}}
