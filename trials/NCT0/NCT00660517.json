No investigational products are permitted for use during the conduct of this study\n* Presence of any hypersensitivity to drugs similar to azelastine hydrochloride or fluticasone propionate\n* Women who are pregnant or nursing\n* Women of childbearing potential who are not abstinent or not practicing a medically acceptable method of contraception\\* see section 6.1.1\n* Respiratory Tract Infections within 14 days prior to Day screening\n* Respiratory Tract Infections requiring antibiotic treatment 14 days prior to screening\n* Asthma (with the exception of mild, intermittent asthma). Subjects with mild, intermittent asthma who only require short-acting inhaled bronchodilators (not more often than twice per week) and who do not have nocturnal awakening as a result of asthma are eligible for enrollment\n* Significant pulmonary disease including COPD\n* Clinically significant arrhythmia or symptomatic cardiac conditions\n* A known history of alcohol or drug abuse within the last 2 years\n* Existence of any surgical or medical condition or physical or laboratory findings, which in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor's medical monitor, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug; that might significantly affect the subject's ability to complete this trial; or their safety in this trial.\n* Clinically relevant abnormal physical findings within 1 week of randomization which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the objectives of the study or that may preclude compliance with the study procedures","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change From Baseline in 12 Hour Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS)","description":"change from baseline in the 12 hour reflective total nasal symptoms score(rTNSS) consisting of nasal congestion,runny nose,itchy nose and sneezing scored twice daily( AM and PM) in diary cards for the entire 14 day study period The measurement scale is 0 to 24.A reduction in symptom severity score is indicated by a negative value.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-5.3","spread":"5.1"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.3","spread":"4.2"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.8","spread":"4.8"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-2.2","spread":"4.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in 12 Hour Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS)","description":"change from baseline in the 12 hour instantaneous total nasal symptoms score(iTNSS) consisting of nasal congestion,runny nose,itchy nose and sneezing scored twice daily( AM and PM) in diary cards for the entire 14 day study period.\n\nThe measurement scale is 0 to 24.A reduction in symptom severity score is indicated by a negative value.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.4","spread":"5.2"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.0","spread":"4.5"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-3.5","spread":"4.8"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-1.7","spread":"4.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Adult ( Greater Than 18 Years of Age) Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)at the End of 14 Days","description":"Change from Baseline in adult ( greater than 18 years of age) Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)at the end of 14 days The measurement scale is 0 to 24.
