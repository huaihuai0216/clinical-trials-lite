Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one chemotherapy drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen plus radiation therapy is more effective for endometrial cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Recurrence-Free Survival of Eligible Patients Who Received a Random Treatment Allocation.","timeFrame":"study entry up to 5 years post treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1","deltaMin":159,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2","deltaMin":175,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":22,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":10,"n":261},"commonTop":["Leukopenia","Neutropenia","Alopecia","Anemia","Constitutional"]}}
