Trastuzumab (Herceptin) will be administered as intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg (loading dose 8 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. The chemotherapy consists of a combination of 6 cycles of fluorouracil (800 mg/m2/day intravenous infusion every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks), or capecitabine (Xeloda, 1000 mg/m2 po twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) will continue until disease progression. The target sample size is 300-600 patients.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival (OS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event","timeFrame":"Baseline (BL), Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 43, 64, 85, 106, 127, and every 21 days until the end of study, 1 year after the cut-off date for the 2nd interim efficacy analysis","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fluoropyrimidine/Cisplatin (FP)","deltaMin":62.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Trastuzumab + Fluoropyrimidine/Cisplatin (FP + H)","deltaMin":56.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":142,"countries":["Australia","Belgium","Brazil","China","Costa Rica","Denmark","Finland","France","Germany","Guatemala","India","Italy","Japan","Mexico","Panama","Peru","Portugal","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25038874","24951609","22116464","20728210"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":81,"n":290},"commonTop":["Nausea","Neutropenia","Vomiting","Decreased appetite","Fatigue"]}}
