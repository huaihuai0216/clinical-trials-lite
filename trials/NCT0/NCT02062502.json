The primary hypotheses being tested are that antibody response rate and mean antibody titer induced at 6 weeks after a single vaccination by VARIVAX™ NSP are non-inferior to those induced by VARIVAX™ 2007 process, and that antibody response rate induced by VARIVAX™ NSP is acceptable.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Antibody Levels >=5 Glycoprotein Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (gpELISA) Units/mL","timeFrame":"6 weeks (43 days) after vaccination 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"VARIVAX™ New Seed Process + M-M-R II™","deltaMin":97.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"VARIVAX™ 2007 Process + M-M-R II™","deltaMin":97.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["29087781"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":6,"n":291},"commonTop":["Injection site pain","Injection site erythema","Injection site swelling","Pyrexia","Upper respiratory tract infection"]}}
