C7-T1;\n* Symptomatic at only one level from C3-C4 to C7-T1;\n* Unresponsive to non-operative treatment for six weeks, or has the presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord compression in the face of conservative treatment;\n* Baseline NDI score of ≥30/100;\n* Radiographically determined pathology at level to be treated correlating to primary symptoms, including at least one of the following: decreased disc height, degenerative spondylosis on CT or MRI, or disc herniation;\n* Appropriate for treatment using an anterior surgical approach, including having no more than one previous anterior surgical approach to the cervical spine;\n* Ability and willingness to comply with follow-up regimen; and\n* Written informed consent given by subject or subject's legally authorized representative.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Infection at the site of surgery;\n* History of, or anticipated treatment for, active systemic infection, including HIV infection or hepatitis C;\n* Prior attempted or completed cervical spine surgery, except (1) laminoforaminotomy with less than one-third facetectomy at any level, or (2) a successful single-level anterior cervical fusion;\n* More than one immobile vertebral level between C1-T1 from any cause, including but not limited to congenital abnormalities, osteoarthritic \"spontaneous\" fusions, and prior cervical spinal fusions;\n* Previous trauma to the C3-T1 levels resulting in significant bony or disco-ligamentous cervical spine injury;\n* Axial neck pain in the absence of other symptoms of radiculopathy or myelopathy justifying the need for surgical intervention;\n* Radiographic confirmation of severe facet joint disease or degeneration.\n* Osteoporosis:\n* Severe diabetes mellitus requiring daily insulin management;\n* Active malignancy: a history of any invasive malignancy (except non-melanoma skin cancer), unless the patient has been treated with curative intent and there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for at least 5 years;\n* Tumor as source of symptoms;\n* Symptomatic DDD or significant cervical spondylosis at two or more levels;\n* Known or suspected allergy to cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, or polyethylene;\n* Severe myelopathy to the extent that the patient is wheelchair bound;\n* Pregnant (verified in patients of childbearing potential by a negative urine pregnancy test when preadmission testing is obtained), or interested in becoming pregnant during the duration of the study;\n* Autoimmune disorders that impact the musculoskeletal system (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis; ankylosing spondylitis);\n* Spinal axis disease (thoracic or lumbar) to the extent that surgical consideration is likely anticipated within 6 months after the cervical randomized procedure;\n* Other degenerative joint disease (e.g. shoulder, hip, knee) to the extent that surgical consideration is likely anticipated within 6 months after the cervical randomized procedure;\n* Previous spine surgery within the 6 months preceding the cervical randomized procedure;\n* Current or recent history of substance abuse (drug or alcohol);\n* Morbid obesity, defined as body mass index (\"BMI\") \\> 40 or more than 100 lbs. over ideal body weight;\n* Currently using, or planning to use, bone growth stimulators in the cervical spine;\n* Use of any other investigational drug or medical device within the last 30 days prior to surgery\n* Currently a prisoner; or\n* Currently pursuing personal litigation related to the neck or cervical spine injury; however, involvement in worker's compensation related litigation is not a required exclusion.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65
