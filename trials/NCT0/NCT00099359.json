This study will assess the safety and efficacy of two different combinations of anti-HIV medications compared to a one drug standard regimen in preventing mother to baby transmission. The one drug standard treatment and two combinations to be studied are: 1) zidovudine, 2) zidovudine/nevirapine and 3) zidovudine/lamivudine/nelfinavir.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Infant HIV Infection Status","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ARM A (ZDV - Standard of Care)","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"ARM B (ZDV + NVP)","deltaMin":11,"sd":null},{"arm":"ARM C (ZDV +3TC+NFV)","deltaMin":12,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":".046"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":17,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Brazil","Puerto Rico","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":["21666540","18398973","22716975","30216294","29750766","29304083","28369278","26372927","25742089"],"seeAlso":["http://www.nichd.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":219,"n":581},"commonTop":["Aspartate Aminotransferase Increased","Anaemia NOS","neutropenia","oral candidiasis"]}}
