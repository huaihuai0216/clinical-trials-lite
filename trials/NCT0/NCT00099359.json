HIV-1 infection for the purposes of enrollment into this study is defined as: (a) Single positive HIV-1 rapid test in mother or her infant; or (b) Historical documentation of a positive HIV-1 diagnostic test confirmed by repeat diagnostic testing for HIV-1 according to country guidelines in mother (written documentation of test results must be present in the medical record).\n* Maternal written informed consent for study participation.\n* Mother has not received any antiretroviral therapy during the current pregnancy prior to the onset of labor and delivery; women may have received intravenous or oral ZDV during labor. Women may have received any antiretroviral therapy in previous pregnancies for prevention of vertical HIV-1 transmission.\n* Infant is \\<48 hours old. Infant may have received up to 48 hours of ZDV as standard care before study enrollment.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nInfants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:\n\n* Extreme prematurity (\\< 32 weeks of gestation).\n* Birth weight \\<1500 grams.\n* Presence of life-threatening conditions.\n* Inability to take oral medication throughout the first 48 hours of life (must be able to receive oral medication by age 48 hours).\n* Maternal inability to provide informed consent because of a lack of a conscious state, psychiatric conditions, or language barriers.\n* Mother received any antiretroviral therapy during labor and delivery other than intravenous or oral ZDV.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","maximumAge":"2 Days","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Infant HIV Infection Status","description":"Intrapartum HIV infection at 3 Months","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Participants With Serious Adverse Events","description":"Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class=Blood and lymphatic system disorders","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"86","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"59","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"110","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Infant HIV-1 Infection Status","description":"In utero HIV-1 infection rate","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"37","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"28","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Participant Deaths","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"17","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Clinical Covariates of HIV-1 Infection","description":"Compare HIV-1 RNA levels; CD4+ lymphocyte counts; and rates of genotypic and phenotypic resistance among the three treatment regimens.","paramType":null,"dispersionType":null,"classes":[]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"3TC and NFV Pharmacokinetics","description":"Descriptive study of 3TC and NFV pharmacokinetics during first two weeks of life using weight band dosing regimen in a subset of enrolled infants.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20.7","spread":"46.57"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25.5","spread":"13.10"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.0","spread":"4.50"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.9","spread":"4.12"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Risk Factors for Perinatal HIV-1 Transmission","description":"Risk factors to be assessed include maternal HIV-1 RNA levels at delivery, maternal syphilis and other infections, obstetrical factors such as duration of membrane rupture, and adherence to neonatal medication.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"516","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"523","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"505","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"130","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"NVP Pharmacokinetics","description":"Descriptive study of NVP pharmacokinetics during first two weeks of life using weight band dosing in a subset of enrolled infants.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"Full Range","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"362","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2286","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"459","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":219,"n":581},"commonTop":["Aspartate Aminotransferase Increased","Anaemia NOS","neutropenia","oral candidiasis"]}}}
