Treatment medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide will be inhaled once daily, using one of the two dose levels versus placebo together with other corticosteroids used as intermittent treatment. The study duration consists of a baseline period (3 to 4 weeks) and a treatment period (12 months). The study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Time to First Asthma Exacerbation","timeFrame":"Up to 12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ciclesonide 100 µg","deltaMin":225.1,"sd":14.73},{"arm":"Ciclesonide 200 µg","deltaMin":249.5,"sd":14.79},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":227.2,"sd":15.2}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.6625"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.7303"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"4 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["Canada","Hungary","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":79},"commonTop":["Asthma","Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Headache","Cough"]}}
