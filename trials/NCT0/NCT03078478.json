The aim of the trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec and insulin glargine 300 units/mL in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately treated with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. Due to change in glycaemic data collection process, this trial is amended to allow for a full 36 weeks (maintenance 2 period) of the use of the new process.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Severe or BG-confirmed Symptomatic Hypoglycaemic Episodes During Maintenance 2 (36 Weeks)","timeFrame":"36 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Degludec 200","deltaMin":216.8,"sd":null},{"arm":"Insulin Glargine U300","deltaMin":243.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.1715"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":229,"countries":["United States","Canada","Denmark","Estonia","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Norway","Poland","Puerto Rico","Romania","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30974986","31984443","32306247"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":167,"n":802},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Diarrhoea","Back pain","Arthralgia"]}}
