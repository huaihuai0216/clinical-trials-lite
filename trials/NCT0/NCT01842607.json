Subjects will be expected to continue controller therapy for the duration of the study.\n* Male or eligible female subjects:\n* To be eligible for entry into the study, females of childbearing potential must commit to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the trial and for 4 months after the last study drug administration.\n* A serum pregnancy test is required of all females at the initial Baseline Visit (Visit 1). In addition, a urine pregnancy test will be performed for all females prior to enrollment, during each scheduled study visit prior to the injection of investigational product, and during the Follow-up Visit.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction related to study medication during the MEA115588 or MEA115575 that led to patient withdrawal. Subjects who experienced a localized injection site reaction do not need to be excluded.\n* Health Status: Clinically significant change in health status during MEA115588 or MEA115575 which in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject unsuitable for participation in this long-term study.\n* Malignancy: A current malignancy or malignancy that developed during MEA115588 or MEA115575 (subjects that had localized carcinoma of the skin which was resected for cure will not be excluded). \\[Note for South Korea: Korean subjects with a diagnosis of malignancy within 5 years are excluded\\]\n* Prior SAE: A study related SAE in MEA115588 or MEA115575 that was assessed as possibly related to study medication by the investigator.\n* Pregnancy: Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
