The key advantages to inclusion of the SAQLI is that it is the only clinician-administered scale in the study and it contains a CPAP side effect scale that is one of the few valid measures of the frequency and amount of CPAP side effects.\n\n1.

The advantage of having a single, scaled score instead of multiple separate subscale domains is important for comparing interventions. The QWB-SA is a comprehensive measure of health-related quality of life that consists of 78-items and five sections: (I) acute and chronic symptoms; (II) self-care activities; (III) mobility; (IV) physical activity and performance of physical functioning; and (V) social activity. The level of functioning and the subjective symptom reports are then weighted by preference, or utility, on a scale that ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.0 (optimum function).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.56","spread":"0.13"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.59","spread":"014"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Self-Efficacy","description":"Social-cognitive theory (SCT) measure\n\n1= Disagree Completely 5= Agree Completely 6= Not applicable","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.9","spread":"1.04"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.3","spread":"0.8"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Outcome Expectation","description":"Social-cognitive theory (SCT) measure\n\n1= Not at all important 5= Extremely important 6= Not applicable","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.1","spread":"0.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"4.5","spread":"0.7"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (Short Form)","description":"The CES-D is a 10-item self-report measure of depression.
