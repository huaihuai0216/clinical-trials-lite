Randomization, blinding, and stratification were not applied in this open-label single-arm study.\n\nEligible subjects given open-label treatment and received treatment with lenalidomide plus high-dose dexamethasone in 28-day cycles.\n\nLenalidomide (hard capsules) was to be administered orally (PO) at a dose of 25 mg daily (QD) for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. According to the protocol, accrual of subjects to the study was to be terminated within 2 months of commercial availability of lenalidomide for this indication in Germany.\n\nUpon discontinuation from study, minimal information was collected in order to identify when disease progressed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kaplan Meier Estimate for Time to Disease Progression","timeFrame":"up to 827 days","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lenalidomide Plus Dexamethasone","deltaMin":214,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":11},"locations":{"siteCount":48,"countries":["Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":79,"n":144},"commonTop":["Muscle spasms","Fatigue","Leukopenia","Thromboyctopenia","Diarrhoea"]}}
