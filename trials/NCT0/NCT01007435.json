The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × √(TJC28)) + (0.28 × √(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(ESR)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints. GH = a patient's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity \\[symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms\\], right end = maximum disease activity \\[maximum arthritis disease activity\\]). When ESR equaled 0 mm/hr, it was set to 1 mm/hr. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"44.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"38.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With a Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) Remission Response at Week 52","description":null,"paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19.5","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"34.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"49.0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"39.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With an Improvement ≥ 20%, 50%, or 70% in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Score (ACR20/50/70) From Baseline to Weeks 24 and 52","description":"Improvement must be seen in tender (68) and swollen (66) joint counts.
