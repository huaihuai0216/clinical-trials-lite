History of anaphylaxis or Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to agalsidase alfa\n2. History of renal dialysis or transplantation\n3. History of acute kidney injury in the 12 months prior to screening, including specific kidney diseases (e.g., acute interstitial nephritis, acute glomerular and vasculitic renal diseases); non-specific conditions (e.g, ischemia, toxic injury); as well as extrarenal pathology (e.g., prerenal azotemia, and acute postrenal obstructive nephropathy)\n4. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy initiated or dose changed in the 4 weeks prior to screening\n5.
