Subject has taken aluminum-containing phosphate binders for greater than 3 weeks in the last 3 months prior to the Screening Phase, or requires such medications for greater than 3 weeks in the study.\n5. Subject has a current malignancy (with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), or clinically significant liver disease, in the opinion of the Investigator.\n6. Subject has a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the Screening Phase.\n7. Subject is known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.\n8.
