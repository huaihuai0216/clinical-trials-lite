Disease onset may have been systemic, polyarticular, or pauciarticular. If the disease was systemic onset, then the subjects must be free of any systemic JIA manifestations for at least 3 months before the time of qualification.\n* At the time of study screening, the subject must have continuing active disease defined as \\>= 5 swollen joints and \\>= 3 joints with limitation of motion (LOM). These joints are not mutually exclusive.\n* Subjects may be either naÃ¯ve to MTX, inadequate responders to MTX, or intolerant to MTX. Intolerance to MTX will be defined by the subject's physician. The MTX must be maintained at a dose of at least 10 mg/m2 body surface area/week for a minimum of 3 months, prior to screening.\n* Duration of disease is not limited, but must have been long enough for a subject to have been given an adequate trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n* Have not received other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, oral or injectable gold, cyclosporin; or intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig); or cytotoxic agents, for at least 4 weeks prior to receiving 1st dose of study drug. Subjects currently on one or more of these DMARDs must demonstrate active disease (defined above) prior to a minimum 4 weeks (28 days) washout of all DMARDs.\n* Subjects who are refractory to MTX after 3 months of treatment must demonstrate active disease (defined above) prior to enrollment in the open-label part of the trial.\n* Have not received an intra-articular glucocorticoid injection within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to enrollment into the study.\n* Have good venous access and stable hematocrit \\>= 24%.\n* All sexually active male and female study participants must be practicing adequate contraception. Post-pubertal females must have a negative serum pregnancy test no greater than 10 days prior to the first dose of study drug.\n* Parent or guardian has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), after the nature of the study has been explained and the subject's parent or legal guardian has had the opportunity to ask questions.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant or nursing female.\n* Functional class IV by ACR criteria.\n* Laboratory parameters outside limits established in the protocol.\n* Medical history, medical condition, or previous treatment not allowed by the protocol.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"4 Years","maximumAge":"17 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Subjects in the Non-MTX Stratum With Disease Flare During the Double-Blind Phase","description":"The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of adalimumab-treated subjects in the non-MTX stratum with disease flare during the Double-Blind Phase compared with the number of placebo-treated subjects in the non-MTX stratum with disease flare during the double-blind phase.
