One goal of this study is to look at the effects of taking a nasal spray containing oxytocin (a hormone made in the brain) on brain areas involved in emotion regulation while viewing pictures during a neuroimaging (fMRI) session. The investigators will also look at whether oxytocin improves premenstrual mood symptoms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Premenstrual Symptom Severity","timeFrame":"During the late luteal phase of two consecutive menstrual cycles (an average of 3-5 days of treatment)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Oxytocin","deltaMin":25.05,"sd":16.74},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":27.36,"sd":13.8}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":10},"commonTop":["Headache","Uterine cramps","Clogged nostril"]}}
