Prior adjuvant radiotherapy is allowed as part of the treatment of early breast cancer provided that last fraction of radiotherapy occurred at least 6 months prior to randomization. Radiotherapy administered solely for the relief of metastatic bone pain is allowed prior to study entry, providing that:\n\n   * no more than 30% of marrow-bearing bone was irradiated\n   * the last fraction of radiotherapy was administered ≥ 3 weeks prior to randomization.\n9.
