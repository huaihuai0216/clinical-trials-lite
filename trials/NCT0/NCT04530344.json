The scoring of each question is as follows: very much = 3; quite a lot = 2; only a little = 1; not at all = 0; question unanswered = 0. The total score ranges from 0 to 30; higher scores indicate higher quality of life. Change from Week 52 was calculated as the post-Week 52 value minus the Week 52 value.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.67","spread":"2.887"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1.00","spread":"0.632"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"1.25","spread":"1.893"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"2.32","spread":"3.872"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.00","spread":"2.646"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.17","spread":"0.753"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.00","spread":"0.816"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.36","spread":"1.989"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":"0.000"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.50","spread":"0.548"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.50","spread":"0.577"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.41","spread":"2.108"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.33","spread":"2.309"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.00","spread":"0.707"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.00","spread":"1.414"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.36","spread":"1.399"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.67","spread":"1.155"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.40","spread":"1.140"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"0.50","spread":"0.577"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.23","spread":"1.541"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-2.00","spread":"2.828"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.40","spread":"0.548"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.75","spread":"1.708"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.15","spread":"1.814"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":"NA"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.25","spread":"1.258"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.25","spread":"0.957"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"0.70","spread":"3.614"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.50","spread":"0.707"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.67","spread":"1.155"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-1.25","spread":"1.893"},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"-0.20","spread":"4.086"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)","description":"A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) reported for the first time or the worsening of a pre-existing event after the first application of study drug in this study. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related.

Results from the two parent studies indicated that steady state was reached at or before Week 4, and that, hence, the use of vehicle or ruxolitinib 1.5% in the first 52 weeks of treatment had no impact on the ruxolitinib plasma concentration at the Week 80 and Week 104 (End of Treatment) visits.
