An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. AEs severity were graded on a 3-point scale as: 1 = mild; discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity, 2 = moderate; discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity, and 3 = severe; inability to work or perform normal daily activity.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"79","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"86","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"60","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"68","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"31","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"29","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":184},"commonTop":["Akathisia","Headache"]}}}
