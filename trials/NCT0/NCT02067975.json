Studies with rodents indicate that levels of KYNA can impact levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine. One way to reliably increase KYNA levels is by ingesting the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is a normal part of the human diet. Tryptophan gets metabolized/changed to other chemicals in the body- including KYNA. By giving people 6 grams of tryptophan, the investigators will be able to increase the KYNA level in a controlled way. The investigators will then be able to study the effects of KYNA on neurotransmitters by using cognitive tests and magnetic resonance imaging techniques (measuring brain activity and brain chemistry using the MRI magnet). They will test people using tryptophan and also using a placebo to look for differences. The investigators will test healthy controls and people with schizophrenia to look for differences.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Verbal Memory Scores From Baseline to 4 Hours Post-Treatment","timeFrame":"The order in which participants received either the tryptophan or placebo was randomized. The HVLT was administered 90 minutes prior to treatment and 4 hours post treatment. There were at least two weeks between the challenge days.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Healthy Controls: Placebo","deltaMin":53.9,"sd":8.01},{"arm":"Schizophrenia Related Disorders: Placebo","deltaMin":40.49,"sd":11.27},{"arm":"Healthy Controls: Tryptophan","deltaMin":53.03,"sd":9.53},{"arm":"Schizophrenia Related Disorders: Tryptophan","deltaMin":38.49,"sd":10.77}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37118058"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":36},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Dizziness","Headache","Syncope"]}}
