The target population includes participants with CD who are refractory or intolerant to corticosteroids (CS) and/or immunosuppressant (IS) therapy and who have either not received prior anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy (TNF-naive) or who have had prior exposure to anti-TNF therapies and demonstrated inadequate responses or intolerance to anti-TNFs.\n\nThe study period will consist of a Screening Phase (up to 35 days) plus (+) a 14-week Induction Phase + a 52-week Maintenance Phase + a 12-week Safety Follow-up Phase. At Week 14 (end of Induction Phase), participants achieving a decrease from baseline of at least 70 points in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score (CDAI-70 response) without the use of rescue therapy will continue to the Maintenance Phase.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Induction Phase: Cohort 1: Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission at Week 14","timeFrame":"Week 14","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Induction Phase - Cohort 1 (Exploratory): Placebo","deltaMin":11.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Induction Phase - Cohort 1 (Exploratory): Etrolizumab 105 mg","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Induction Phase - Cohort 1 (Exploratory): Etrolizumab 210 mg","deltaMin":27.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":327,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Latvia","Lithuania","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Switzerland","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36240801","34467254","32464142","32445184"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":59},"commonTop":["Crohn's disease","Headache","Abdominal pain","Arthralgia","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
