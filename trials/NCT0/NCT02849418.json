After the first treatment, subjects who meet the re-treatment criteria between 12 to 36 weeks can enter an open-label Treatment phase 2 to receive a second treatment with GSK1358820 200 U. Subjects will be permitted to receive re-treatment up to 2 times, and there should be a gap of minimum of 12 weeks since the previous treatment. The duration of overall treatment phases is 48 weeks. The total duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including screening.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Treatment Phase 1 (Treatment Cycle 1)- Change From Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes at Week 6","timeFrame":"Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) and Week 6 in Treatment Cycle 1","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment Cycle 1: Placebo","deltaMin":-0.18,"sd":0.957},{"arm":"Treatment Cycle 1: GSK1358820 200U","deltaMin":-3.2,"sd":0.911}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"20 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":21},"locations":{"siteCount":9,"countries":["Japan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["34075630"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":10},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Decubitus ulcer","Pyrexia","Haematuria","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
