In addition:\n\n  1. Spinal cord injury subjects must have a stable neurological injury level C5 or below occurring \\>=6 months prior to screening.\n  2. Multiple sclerosis subjects must be clinically stable in the investigator's opinion, for \\>=3 months prior to screening and have an Expanded Disability Status Scale score \\<=6.5\n* Subject has NDO for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening, determined by documented subject history.

Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.\n\n     • Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive Potential (FRP) requirements from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication and until the study exit. This list of highly effective methods (approved in Japan) is provided below, and it does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis: Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP effectiveness criteria including a \\<1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the product label; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.\n\n     These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label.
