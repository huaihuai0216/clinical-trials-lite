women\n* Randomized to either denosumab or placebo in the 20050179 (NCT00293813) study and completed that study (ie, attended an end of study visit)\n* At least 12 months have elapsed since their end of 20050179 study visit\n* Provide signed informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects who failed to receive both doses of denosumab (or SQ \\[subcutaneous\\] placebo) during the 20050179 study\n* Subjects who were randomized to the alendronate arm during the 20050179 study\n* Subjects diagnosed with any of the following conditions following completion of the 20050179 study:\n* Hyperthyroidism\n* Hyperparathyroidism\n* Malignancy within the last 5 years (except cervical carcinoma in situ or basal cell carcinoma)\n* Any condition that required chronic (greater than three months cumulative and greater than 5 mg/day) glucocorticoid therapy\n* Other diseases which affect bone metabolism\n* Self-reported alcohol or drug abuse within the previous 12 months\n* Any disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed consent and/or comply with study procedures\n* Received any investigational product other than denosumab in two years before the screening visit.\n* Received \\> 3 months (or equivalent) of osteoporosis treatment since having completed the 20050179 study.\n* Current use of the following osteoporosis agents: bisphosphonates, calcitonin, fluoride, parathyroid hormone analogue, selective estrogen receptor modulators, systemic oral or transdermal estrogen (except vaginal preparations and estrogen creams which are acceptable), strontium or tibolone.\n* Currently enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 1 month since ending other investigational device or drug trial(s) (other than Amgen trial 20080287), or subject is receiving other investigational agent(s).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percent
