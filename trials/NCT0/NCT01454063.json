First, the AUC of the pupil diameter from surgical baseline to wound closure was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Second, the mean AUC was obtained by dividing the AUC by the total time of surgery. Third, the mean AUC of change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline pupil diameter from the mean AUC.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.41"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.5","spread":"0.58"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Area-under-the-Curve Analysis of Ocular Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score Within 12 Hours Postoperatively","description":"The primary analysis of the ocular pain VAS (where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain) was based on the mean area-under-the-curve (AUC).
