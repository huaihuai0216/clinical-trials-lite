A pain intensity score of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain) is obtained before starting the study and throughout the 48 time period. The pain score at each assessment time is subtracted from the baseline pain score to provide the total sum score or SPID-48. A higher SPID-48 is better and indicates a reduction in pain intensity compared to the baseline score. The range of SPID48 scores were -232 to 326.\n\nTime-weighted SPID48 = ∑ \\[T(i) - T(i-1)\\] x PID(i), where T(0) = Time 0 (baseline), T(i) is the scheduled or unscheduled assessment time, and PID(i) is the PID score at time i for i=0 to 48 hours.\n\nNote: Active group n=114 and placebo group n=58, instead of active n=115 and placebo n=57, due to one \"active\" patient receiving placebo inadvertently.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"105.60","spread":"10.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"55.58","spread":"13.11"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":114},"commonTop":["Nausea","Vomiting","Oxygen Saturation Decreased","Pruritus","Dizziness"]}}}
