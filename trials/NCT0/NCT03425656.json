The main objective is to verify the non-inferiority of AryoTrust (Aryogen trastuzumab) vs. Herceptin速 (Genentech/Roche trastuzumab), both given concomitantly with docetaxel after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in the neoadjuvant setting according to pathological complete response (pCR) as primary objective and objective response (cOR), clinical complete response (cCR), clinical partial response (cPR), clinical stable disease (cSD), clinical progressive disease (cPD), breast conservation rate as Secondary objectives of this study. Evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of AryoTrust vs. Herceptin速, are also the other secondary outcomes. This study has two arms and 108 subjects will participate with a 1:1 allocation and receive mentioned treatment randomly.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pathologic Complete Response","timeFrame":"week 23","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trastuzumab (AryoTrust)","deltaMin":18,"sd":null},{"arm":"Trastuzumab (Herceptin)","deltaMin":15,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.73"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["Iran"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":54},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Anaemia","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Neutropenia","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
