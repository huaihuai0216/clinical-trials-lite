Weighs ≥10 kg at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).\n4. Failure to control seizures despite appropriate trials of at least 1 ASM based on historical information, and is currently on an antiseizure therapy or other treatment options considered as standard of care (SOC).\n5. Artisanal cannabidiols are allowed at a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before the screening visit (Visit 1); the dosing regimen and manufacturer should remain constant throughout the study.
