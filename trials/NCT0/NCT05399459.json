Less than 15 days with headache (migraine or non-migraine) per month in each of the 3 months prior to Screening Visit and maintains this requirement during the Screening Period.\n7. Subjects on prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy if the dose has been stable for at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit, and if the dose is not expected to change during the course of the study.\n8.
