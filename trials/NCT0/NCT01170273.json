The total SPPB score is the sum of the scores of the 3 components and can range from 0 to 12, with 0 reflecting severe limitations and 12 minimal or no limitations. The ranges for each subscale are: balance (0-4), gait speed (0-4), sit-to-stand (0-4). In all the subscales, 0 reflects worse outcome and 4 best outcome.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.3","spread":"1.69"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.0","spread":"1.62"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":64},"commonTop":["fall","hypercalcemia"]}}}
