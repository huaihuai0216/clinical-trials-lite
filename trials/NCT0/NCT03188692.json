Those who are applicable of the following conditions must be carefully observed before the enrollment: infants with known underlying disease such as cardiovascular disease, renal disease, hepatic disease, blood dyscrasia, respiratory disease or developmental disorder. Infants who developed fever within 2 days after any previous vaccination. Infants with history of convulsions.\n* Written informed consent is obtained from a legal guardian (parent)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* With past diagnosis of immunodeficiency or currently under immunosuppressive treatment\n* Have close relatives (the third degree of kinship) diagnosed with congenital immunodeficiency\n* Possibility of anaphylaxis due to food or pharmaceuticals\n* With diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and/or coagulopathy or currently under treatment of the antiplatelet agents and/or anticoagulant agents.\n* With experience of Hib infection, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus or acute poliomyelitis\n* With experience of Hib, diphteria, pertussis, tetanus or polio vaccination.\n* Administered a live vaccine within 27 days before the first vaccination of the study drug, or inactivated vaccine or toxoid within 6 days before vaccination\n* Administered transfusion, immunosuppressant (excluding drugs for external use), or immunoglobulin formulation\n* Administered corticosteroid 2 mg/kg per day or more as prednisolone (excluding drugs for external use)\n* Participated in other studies within 12 weeks before obtaining consent\n* With the gestational age \\<37
