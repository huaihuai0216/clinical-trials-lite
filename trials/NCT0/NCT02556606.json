Criteria:\n\n* Male or female patients, 55 years of age,\n* Participants must fulfill DSM 5 criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (Unipolar), based on a structured diagnostic interview, the DSM 5 M.I.N.I. 7.0\n* Participants must have a history of at least one previous episode of depression prior to the current episode (recurrent MDD) or have chronic MDD (of at least two years' duration),\n* Participants have not responded to two or more adequate trials of FDA-approved antidepressants, determined by Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) criteria.\n* Participants must score 14 or greater on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR), and score 27 on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS),\n* Each participant must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and examinations required by the protocol and must sign an informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients currently on fluoxetine,\n* History of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or any psychotic disorder, or bipolar disorder,\n* Documented history of a psychotic disorder in a first-degree relative,\n* Current diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or eating disorder \\[bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa\\],\n* Alcohol or substance use \\[except nicotine\\] within the preceding 6 months,\n* Patients with any clinically significant personality disorder that would, in the investigator's judgment, preclude safe study participation,\n* Patients judged to be at serious and imminent suicidal or homicidal risk,\n* Serious, unstable medical illnesses including respiratory \\[obstructive sleep apnea, or history of difficulty with airway management during previous anesthetics\\], cardiovascular \\[including ischemic heart disease and uncontrolled hypertension\\], and neurologic \\[including history of severe head injury\\],\n* For study entry, patients must be reasonable medical candidates for ketamine or midazolam infusion, as determined by a board-certified physician co-investigator during study Screening,\n* Clinically significant abnormal findings of laboratory parameters \\[including urine toxicology screen for drugs of abuse\\], physical examination, or ECG,\n* Hypertension (systolic BP \\>160 mm Hg or diastolic BP \\>90 mm Hg),\n* Patients with one or more 11 seizures without a clear and resolved etiology,\n* Patients starting hormonal treatment (e.g., estrogen) in the 3 months prior to Screening,\n* Past intolerance or hypersensitivity to ketamine, or history of recreational use of phencyclidine (PCP) or ketamine,\n* Past intolerance or hypersensitivity to midazolam,\n* Age-related cognitive decline or mild dementia suggested by a score of \\< 25 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at Screening,\n* Patients taking medications with known activity at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) or AMPA glutamate receptor \\[e.g., riluzole, amantadine, lamotrigine, memantine, topiramate, dextromethorphan, D-cycloserine\\], or the muopioid receptor,\n* Patients taking any of the following medications: St John's Wort, theophylline, tramadol, metrizamide,\n* Patients who demonstrate \\> 25% decrease in depressive symptoms as reflected by the QIDS-SR score from Screening to Randomization,\n* Patients who have received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the past 6 months prior to Screening,\n* Patients currently receiving treatment with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) or repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"55
