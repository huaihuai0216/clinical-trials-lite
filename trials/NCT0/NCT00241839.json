Individuals on beta blockade or calcium channel blockade for coronary artery disease and/or arrhythmia will not be eligible for the study)\n* Random spot urine protein/creatinine ratio of less than 0.5 (approximates a 24-hour urinary protein excretion of 500 mg/day)\n* Calculated MDRD GFR of greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73/m\\^2\n* No allopurinol or probenecid intake for at least one month prior to study entry\n* Willing and able to cooperate with study procedures\n* Willing to travel to the GCRC at Shands Hospital for overnight inpatient stays on two separate occasions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of malignant or accelerated hypertension\n* Confirmed total white cell count of less than 2,500/mm\\^3, anemia, or thrombocytopenia\n* Known history of liver disease\n* Known secondary cause of hypertension\n* Known presence of diabetes or fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL\n* History of heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke or on a Î²-blocker or calcium channel blocker for cardiovascular indications other than for lowering blood pressure\n* Abnormal EKG requiring medical intervention\n* History of clinical or renal biopsy or evidence of renal parenchymal disease\n* Acute gout attack within 2 weeks of study entry\n* History of drug abuse in the last 2 years, including narcotics, cocaine, or alcohol (greater than 21 drinks/week)\n* Arm circumference of greater than 52 cm, which precludes measurement with a 'thigh' BP cuff\n* History of a reaction to allopurinol or chlorthalidone\n* Pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study, or breastfeeding\n* History of noncompliance, are unable to comply with the study requirements, or who are currently participating in another study\n* Not fasting prior to obtaining screening laboratory data. If a participant has clearly not fasted, we will exclude those individuals with casual blood glucose levels of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. In the event that a fasting blood sugar exceeds 126 mg/dL, it will be reconfirmed on a blood glucose measurement obtained on a subsequent day, per American Diabetes Association criteria","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Diastolic Blood Pressure by Cuff 8-10 Weeks Minus Baseline","description":"The Diastolic BP was taken at Baseline and after 8-10 weeks of treatment or placebo while on chlorthalidone and potassium chloride.
