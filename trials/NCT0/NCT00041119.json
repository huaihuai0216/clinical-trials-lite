Giving additional cancer treatment after surgery may help to lower the risk that the cancer will come back (adjuvant therapy). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether the standard adjuvant therapy of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride is more effective than paclitaxel in treating women with breast cancer","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Relapse Free Survival (RFS) 4 vs. 6 Cycles","timeFrame":"from baseline up to 4 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"4 Cycles (Arm I and Arm III Combined)","deltaMin":null,"sd":null},{"arm":"6 Cycles (Arm II and Arm IV Combined)","deltaMin":null,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":527,"countries":["United States","South Africa"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22843789","22826271","30409792","24934787"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":113,"n":1142},"commonTop":["Hemoglobin decreased","Peripheral sensory neuropathy","Leukocyte count decreased","Mucositis oral","Neutrophil count decreased"]}}
