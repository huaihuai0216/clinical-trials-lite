The study will have a 2 X 2 factorial design, which will allow us to investigate the effects of dietary protein intake and testosterone separately and together.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Lean Body Mass as Measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)","timeFrame":"6 months from baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo/Low Protein","deltaMin":0.14,"sd":0.31},{"arm":"Placebo/High Protein","deltaMin":0.74,"sd":0.33},{"arm":"Testosterone/Low Protein","deltaMin":4.43,"sd":0.48},{"arm":"Testosterone/High Protein","deltaMin":4.13,"sd":0.42}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"65 Years","sex":"MALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["33417663","30932132","29532075","29188864"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":24},"commonTop":["Back pain","Upper respiratory tract infection","Prostatic specific antigen abnormal","Arthralgia","Muscle strain"]}}
