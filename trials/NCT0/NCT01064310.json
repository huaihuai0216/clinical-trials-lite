Study weeks are approximate; participants could have crossed over from P 1 to P 2 at earlier time points than specified in the protocol.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.1","spread":"12.39"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-2.7","spread":"13.09"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.8","spread":"11.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-3.3","spread":"12.41"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-3.8","spread":"13.54"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.8","spread":"13.84"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":35,"n":148},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Fatigue","Hypertension","Decreased appetite"]}}}
