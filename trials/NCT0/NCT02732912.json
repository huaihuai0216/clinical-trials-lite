A Short Questionnaire of the Quality and Quantity of Sleep, and Use of Aids.","description":"SleepSure is a short questionnaire which asks the patient to rate their sleep using a 1-10 numerical rating scale for eight items covering the quality of their sleep (e.g. difficulty getting to sleep, interruptions). Two additional questions recorded the use of aids. It takes no more that 2-3 minutes to complete. The eight numerical rating scores are summed and divided by 8 to give a score from 1 (very good sleep) to 10 (very poor sleep).","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.09","spread":"2.05"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.33","spread":"2.13"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Length of Stay","description":"Time in days from admission to discharge from hospital (not from ward).
