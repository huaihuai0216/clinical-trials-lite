All patients will receive active treatment, but patients will be blinded to dose level. This will serve as an extension to the CVT-301-004 (NCT02240030) study for those patients who participated in that study and remain eligible for this study. In addition, patients who previously completed the CVT-301-003 (NCT01777555), CVT-301-009 (NCT02807675) and CVT-301-005 (NCT02352363) (observational arm completers), as well as CVT-301 na√Øve patients may be enrolled if they meet the CVT-301-004E eligibility criteria.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pulmonary Safety of CVT-301 Change From Baseline for FEV1.","timeFrame":"Change from baseline at 52 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CVT-301 DL1","deltaMin":2.957,"sd":0.6995},{"arm":"CVT-301 DL2","deltaMin":3.117,"sd":0.7735}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":74,"countries":["United States","Canada","Czechia","Poland","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://cvt301.acordatrials.com/en/patient/?src=clinicaltrialsgov004"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":153},"commonTop":["Cough","Fall","Upper respiratory tract infection","Dyskinesia","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
