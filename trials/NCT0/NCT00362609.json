The variance of oral bioavailability was assessed to determine if further PK assessment was appropriate. It would be considered highly variable if the square root of the sum of the standard deviation squares of the area under the concentration-time curves from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUCT) for group A and Group B divided by the sum of the mean AUCT for group A and Group B was \\>1.2.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.07","spread":"2.59"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.74","spread":"2.29"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC)","description":"AUC is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time.
