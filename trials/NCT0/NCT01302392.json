Other malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of a) adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; b) carcinoma in situ of the cervix, vulva, or breast; c) prostate cancer of Gleason Score 6 or less with stable prostate-specific antigen levels; or d) cancer considered cured by surgical resection or unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the study, such as localized transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, carcinoma in situ of the breast, or benign tumors of the adrenal or pancreas\n18. Significant neuropathy (Grades 3-4, or Grade 2 with pain) at the time of randomization\n19. Any other clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, may interfere with protocol adherence or a patient's ability to give informed consent\n20.
