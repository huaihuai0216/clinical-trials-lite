The objective of the study is to demonstrate that Crizotinib is superior to first-line chemotherapy pemetrexed/cisplatin or pemetrexed/carboplatin in prolonging Progression Free Survival (PFS) in East Asian patients with advanced Non-Squamous NSCLC whose tumors harbor a translocation or inversion event involving the ALK (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase) gene locus.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Based on IRR by Treatment Arm","timeFrame":"Randomization to objective progression, death or last tumor assessment without progression before any additional anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred first, assessed up to 33 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Crizotinib","deltaMin":11.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Chemotherapy","deltaMin":6.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":47,"countries":["China","Hong Kong","Malaysia","Taiwan","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["29966800"],"seeAlso":["https://trialinfoemail.pfizer.com/pages/landing.aspx?StudyID=A8081029&StudyName=A%20Study%20Of%20Crizotinib%20Versus%20Chemotherapy%20In%20Previously%20Untreated%20ALK%20Positive%20East%20Asian%20Non-Small%20Cell%20Lung%20Cancer%20Patients"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":46,"n":104},"commonTop":["Alanine aminotransferase increased","Vomiting","Nausea","White blood cell count decreased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
