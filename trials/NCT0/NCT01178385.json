Co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that caused by the autism diagnosis. Although effective interventions have been developed for typically developing youth with anxiety disorders, this approach needs to be adapted for children with autism. Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of CBT relative to treatment as usual (TAU) in 46 youth ages 7-11 with autism spectrum disorders and comorbid anxiety disorder(s).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (Measures the Severity of Anxiety Symptoms)","timeFrame":"After an average of 16 weeks (Post-treatment)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cognitive-behavioral Therapy","deltaMin":16.33,"sd":1.93},{"arm":"Treatment as Usual","deltaMin":17.62,"sd":2.04}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"7 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23357440"],"seeAlso":["http://health.usf.edu/medicine/pediatrics/rothman/index.htm"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":24},"commonTop":[]}}
