In addition, during the 12 months preceding the study, subjects were required not to have used isotretinoin (Accutane), or applied topical steroids to the site to be treated. Moreover, previous laser or topical medication at the to-be-treated site was not permitted.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percent Change From Baseline in Microtopographic Profilometry Ra Values (Skin Roughness).","description":"Phaseshift Rapid In vivo Measurement Of Skin (PRIMOS) readings.
