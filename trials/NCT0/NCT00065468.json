For each treatment group, it is the weighted sum of the mean durations of the health states Tox, Twist, and Relapse. Tox is defined as time with severe toxicity related to treatment; Twist: time without symptoms or toxic side effects; and Relapse: time after relapse/progression. The mean duration of each health state is calculated based on the area under the Kaplan Meier curve pertaining to that health state. There is no direct method for calculating the \"dispersion\" of Q-Twist, and it is typically done using bootstrap method for purposes of inference (see, e.g., Glasziou PP, Simes RJ, Gelber RD. Quality adjusted survival analysis. Stat Med 1990; 9: 1259-76). In practice, as apparently in the case with this study, the intermediate values resulting from the bootstrap exercise were not displayed.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.9083","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.3707","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.4821","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D) - Index Score","description":"EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value.
