The study consists of a two-year accrual period and five years of follow-up (7 years total) of 1700 patients across 20 centers. We have powered the study to detect a 21% reduction in the primary event rate. Additional study goals are to determine whether the expenditures, discomfort, and adverse effects associated with intensive intervention are justified in terms of their clinical benefits, considering both macrovascular and microvascular complications.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Primary Major Macrovascular Events","timeFrame":"Post baseline time to the first major macrovascular event up to 82 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm 1","deltaMin":264,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm 2","deltaMin":235,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.05"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":20},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19092145","19726779","19720420","19655124","18671796","18406632","16784922","16627388","16504835","16043738","14583175","11347758","21059830","21775749","33367811","31167051","30455335","27006510","26786575","26039600","25456099","25048382","23536583","20807873","19898642"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":144,"n":899},"commonTop":["Musculoskeletal","Infections","General Disorders","Nervous system","Gastrointestinal Disorders"]}}
