The investigators will also determine the effects of treatment on neural activity in cognitive and limbic brain regions involved in pain regulation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and examine its relationship to opioid use severity.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Average Daily Pain","timeFrame":"3 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"tDCS (Active)","deltaMin":5.41,"sd":0.33},{"arm":"tDCS (Sham)","deltaMin":5.96,"sd":0.38}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":65},"commonTop":["skin irritation","Car accident"]}}
