Patients currently receiving maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa will receive monthly injections of Mircera with a starting dose (120, 200 or 360 micrograms) derived from the dose of epoetin alfa they were receiving in the week preceding study start. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Maintaining Their Mean Hb Concentration Within Â±1.0 Gram/Deciliter of Their Reference Hb and Between 10.5 and 12.5 Gram/Deciliter","timeFrame":"EEP (Week 16 to 24)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"C.E.R.A","deltaMin":43.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":28,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","Chile","Colombia","Ecuador","Mexico","Peru","Uruguay","Venezuela"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26965694"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":53,"n":162},"commonTop":["Hypertension","Hypotension","Diarrhoea"]}}
