The primary hypothesis is that vaccination with V212 will reduce the incidence of HZ compared with placebo in adults with STM (lower bound of the 97.5% {one-sided Î±=0.0125} confidence interval \\[CI\\] for the estimated vaccine efficacy in adults with STM be \\>25%).\n\nParticipants with hematologic malignancy (HM) were also enrolled and were to be originally included in the primary and secondary objectives and analyses.
