Eligible subjects will be randomized to a sequence of UMEC 62.5 mcg, VI 25 mcg, and UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg such that all subjects will receive each treatment.\n\nSerial spirometry assessments will be conducted on Day 1 and Day 14 and trough spirometry will be conducted on Day 2 and Day 15 of each treatment period. On Day 1 and 14 of each treatment period vital signs will be assessed and adverse event (AE)s will be recorded throughout the total duration of the study (approximately 12 weeks).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Obtained Post-dose at Day 14 of Each Treatment Period (TP) by Response Type","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 14 of each treatment period (up to study day 85)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC 62.5 µg","deltaMin":0.155,"sd":0.0184},{"arm":"VI 25 µg","deltaMin":0.156,"sd":0.0185},{"arm":"UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg","deltaMin":0.263,"sd":0.0179}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.008"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["Slovakia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":202},"commonTop":["Headache"]}}
