Study treatment lasted until end of the therapeutic period; visits for Months 36 and 48 were optional since a child may have already finished the study at a prior visit. The Final Visit only occurred if the child did not end the study by a complete visit such as at Months 24, 36 or 48. Results are presented only for percentage of girls with regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage (n=34). Since only one boy was included in the study, results for this outcome measure were listed only and no statistical analysis was performed. Please also note additional post-hoc analysis for regression or stabilisation of Tanner breast pubertal stage which applied the variable Last Visit on Treatment instead of Final Visit.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"61.8","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.9","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Patients With a Suppressed Luteinizing Hormone (LH) Response to Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Test","description":"A suppressed LH response to the GnRH test was defined as a stimulated peak of LH ≤3 international units per litre (IU/L).
