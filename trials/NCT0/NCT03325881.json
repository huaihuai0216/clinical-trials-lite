Parents were asked to think of a recent \"typical\" week of their child's sleep and to indicate how often sleep disturbance behaviors occurred. A 3-point scale was used for rating: \"usually\" if the sleep behavior occurs 5 to 7 times per week, \"sometimes\" for 2 to 4 times per week, and \"rarely\" for once or not at all during the week. The TSD score, which is the sum of all responses, included all items of the 8 subscales, but consisted of only 33 items because two on the bedtime resistance and sleep anxiety subscales were identical (range: 0, 99).
