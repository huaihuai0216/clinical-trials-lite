Patients with persistent atrial fibrillation as defined by continuous atrial fibrillation for at least 6 months and controlled with a rate control strategy (i.e., beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, pacemaker placement, digoxin or ablation therapy) for at least 6 months may be considered for inclusion. In such patients, atrial fibrillation must be present at baseline and screening visits, with a resting ventricular rate \\< 100/min.\n\nPatients with Type I or uncontrolled Type II diabetes and patients with a history of blood glucose levels consistently outside the normal range Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction or moderate to severe renal impairment or urinary retention.\n\nPatients with a history of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5 years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Patients with non-melanoma skin carcinoma may be considered for the study.\n\nPatients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 40 kg/m2.
