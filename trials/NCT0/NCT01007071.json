It has been suggested that GH replacement in such patients leads to improvement in cognitive function. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of GH replacement in patients with GH deficiency on cognitive function using structural and functional neuroimaging and cognitive testing.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"BOLD Signal Measured by Functional MRI Scan to Functional Connectivity Measured by fMRI","timeFrame":"Baseline and 16 weeks","effectByArm":[],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":16},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":["chest pain"]}}
