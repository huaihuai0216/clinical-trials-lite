Many patients attempt to stop smoking after a heart attack, but relapse rates approach 66%. A variety of smoking cessation aids have been shown to be effective for the general population. However, bupropion is the only non-nicotine replacement therapy shown to improve abstinence rates in healthy young smokers. Furthermore, nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) are contraindicated in the immediate period following a heart attack because of the undesirable effects of nicotine. Although bupropion has been successfully used to reduce smoking rates in healthy young populations, its efficacy and safety in the setting of patients recovering from an ACS is unknown. These patients, if they continue to smoke, are at exceptionally high risk for recurrent cardiac events. If bupropion is effective in this population, it will have a major impact on secondary prevention of recurrent clinical events in patients who suffer a heart attack.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Smoking Abstinence","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":32,"sd":null},{"arm":"Bupropion","deltaMin":37.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":38,"countries":["United States","Bangladesh","Canada","India","Iran","Pakistan","Tunisia"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37230961","34611902","33687070","25326910","24440324"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":37,"n":200},"commonTop":["Insomnia","Dry mouth","Dizziness","Dysgeusia","Constipation"]}}
