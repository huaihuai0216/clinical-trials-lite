Patients are randomly assigned to receive standard of care or preoperative acetaminophen 1000 mg and Gatorade sports drinks 2 packets before surgery. Patients are then asked to rate their level of pain, anxiety, thirst, hunger, fatigue on a scale of 0-100 on day of surgery before surgery has started, after clearance of skin cancer, and at the end of the visit. Patients are contacted by phone 48 hours after their surgery to assess their maximum level of post-operative pain (rated from 0-100), usage of over the counter or prescribed pain medications, and presence of complications e.g. bleeding, infection, dehiscence. Differences in perioperative functional status and pain medication usage are compared between patients in control and intervention groups.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Maximum Pain Score","timeFrame":"Day of surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control","deltaMin":2.8,"sd":1.1},{"arm":"Intervention","deltaMin":1.2,"sd":0.6}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":45},"commonTop":[]}}
