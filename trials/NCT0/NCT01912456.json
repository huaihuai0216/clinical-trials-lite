The safety of C1-esterase inhibitor will also be assessed. Each subject will enter a run-in period of up to 8-weeks. Subjects who complete the run-in period and who are eligible will then enter the treatment phase which comprises two sequential treatment periods. In the treatment phase, subjects will be randomized to one of four arms consisting of treatment with low- or higher-volume C1-esterase inhibitor in one treatment period and treatment with low- or higher-volume placebo in the other treatment period. The study will measure the number of hereditary angioedema attacks that subjects experience while receiving each treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"The Time-normalized Number of Hereditary Angioedema Attacks","timeFrame":"During the treatment phase, up to 28 weeks.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"CSL830 (40)","deltaMin":0.04,"sd":0.011},{"arm":"CSL830 (60)","deltaMin":0.02,"sd":0.009},{"arm":"Placebo High","deltaMin":0.12,"sd":0.011},{"arm":"Placebo Low","deltaMin":0.13,"sd":0.009}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"< 0.001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"= 0.114"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":39,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Czechia","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Romania","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28328347","36326435","31485239"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":43},"commonTop":["Injection site erythema","Injection site pain","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Injection site bruising"]}}
