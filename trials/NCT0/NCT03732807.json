anxiety and depression over the past week. Items were rated on a 4-point severity scale. The HADS produces 2 scales, one for anxiety (HADS-A) and one for depression (HADS-D), differentiating the two states with established normal score cut-offs. The instrument have been validated for use by adolescents aged 12 and older. Each subscale comprised of 7 items and the participant responds as to how each item applies to him/her over the past week prior to baseline visit, on 4-point response scale. Separate scores were calculated for anxiety and depression with score ranges from 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score range was from 0 to 21 for depression subscale; higher score indicating greater severity of depression symptoms.
