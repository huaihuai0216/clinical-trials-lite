Liprotamase is stable in the stomach and can be formulated without enteric coating for administration either as a capsule or as a dosing solution dissolved in water or juice. The purpose of the present study is to provide efficacy and safety data for a new, soluble formulation of liprotamase, Liprotamase Powder for Oral Solution, in Cystic Fibrosis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Safety","timeFrame":"1 week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Part A","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Part B","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"28 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":21,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":15},"commonTop":["Infective exacerbation of cystic fibrosis","Aspartate aminotransferase increased"]}}
