Secondary objectives are 1)To compare the cost per SVR for each of the three study arms; 2) To compare adherence among persons across the three study arms; 3) To evaluate the safety, tolerability and acceptability of treatment in the three arms.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"SVR12","timeFrame":"12 weeks after treatment completion, 16 weeks for SOF+DAC+PEG and 24 weeks for SOF+DAC","effectByArm":[{"arm":"SOF+DAC+PEG","deltaMin":26,"sd":null},{"arm":"SOF+DAC, DOT","deltaMin":30,"sd":null},{"arm":"SOF+DAC, Standard","deltaMin":17,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["India"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":50},"commonTop":[]}}
