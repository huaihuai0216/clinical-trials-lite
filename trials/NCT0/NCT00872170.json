Severe kidney insufficiency, defined as use of hemodialysis or serum creatinine at levels greater than 2.5 mg/dL at the time of screening\n  2. Cardiac disease with adjustment of cardiac medications in the 60 days before study entry\n  3. Symptomatic coronary artery disease, as indicated by a history of chest pain, angina, claudication, or surgery to treat coronary artery disease in the 1 year before study entry\n  4. Stroke, defined as a new focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hours in the 45 days before study entry\n  5. New diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by ventilation-perfusion scan, angiography, or any other technique in the 90 days before study entry\n  6. History of retinal detachment or retinal hemorrhage in the 180 days before study entry\n  7. Use of nitrate-based vasodilators, prostacyclin (inhaled, subcutaneous, or intravenous), endothelin antagonists, or any other medication for pulmonary hypertension\n  8. Acute asthma exacerbation requiring use of prednisone in the 60 days before study entry\n  9. Initiation or dosage increase of calcium channel blockers in the 30 days before study entry\n  10. Initiation of any other cardiac or pulmonary medication in the 90 days before study entry\n* Presence of any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, would make the person unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with compliance in the study, including but not limited to alcohol or drug abuse\n* No measurable TRjet on Doppler echocardiography (i.e., presence of pulmonary hypertension cannot be confirmed or ruled out)","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"7 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT) Distance From Baseline to Week 12 Among Sildenafil Group","description":"Change in six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance was calculated as 6MWT at week 12 minus 6MWT at baseline.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.38","spread":"16.01"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Tricuspid Regurgitant Jet Velocity (TRV) From Baseline to Week 12 Among Sildenafil Group","description":"Change in tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) was calculated as TRV at week 12 minus TRV at baseline.
