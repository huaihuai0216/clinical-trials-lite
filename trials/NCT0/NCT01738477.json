For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone (≥ 20 mg/day (for adult subjects), or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol in the period starting 30 days before and ending 31 days after the dose of vaccine, with the exception of Influenza vaccine which is allowed throughout the study period.\n* Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n* Previous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis since the last dose received in the Study NCT00109330.\n* History of diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis diseases following the receipt of booster dose in the Study NCT00109330.\n* Severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) after previous administration of any tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis-antigen containing vaccines, or any component of Boostrix.\n* Hypersensitivity to latex.\n* Encephalopathy (e.g. coma, decreased level of consciousness, prolonged seizures) of unknown etiology occurring within 7 days following previous vaccination with pertussis-containing vaccine.\n* History of any neurological disorders or seizures.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).\n* Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n  * Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 100.4°F for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study will be oral.\n  * Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the booster dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n* Pregnant or lactating female.\n* Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions up to 1 month post-vaccination.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"19 Years","maximumAge":"30
