To address this need, we performed a randomized diagnostic trial (RDT) to determine whether integrating cardiac CT, along with the information it provides on coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular (LV) function, can improve the efficiency of the management of these patients (i.e. shorten length of hospital stay, increase direct discharge rates from the ED, decreasing healthcare costs and improving cost effectiveness while being safe).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Length of Hospital Stay","timeFrame":"Duration of stay in the hospital during the initial visit","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cardiac CT","deltaMin":23.2,"sd":37},{"arm":"Standard of Care","deltaMin":30.8,"sd":28}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38001050","33766254","30405295","30354493","29138794","28923845","28487318","27006119","26762723","26476506","25819865","25710925","25125300","23685743","22830462","22424002"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":501},"commonTop":["ALLERGIC REACTION","Nausea and vomiting","Nausea","RASH URTICARIAL","THROMBOSIS ARTERIAL"]}}
