Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy together with chemotherapy is more effective than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with cervical cancer.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) Rate at 3-years","timeFrame":"3 years from randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Radiation)","deltaMin":85.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Cisplatin + Radiation)","deltaMin":88.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0927"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":9},"locations":{"siteCount":719,"countries":["United States","Japan","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31912685"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":170},"commonTop":["White Blood Cell Decreased","Nausea","Anemia","Diarrhea","Neutrophil Count Decreased"]}}
