The study will also assess the effect of treatments on response, duration of response, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study will continue for 12 months following last patient enrolled.\n\nSee study AZA PH GL 2003 CL 001 E for information about the extension to this study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Median Time to Death From Any Cause","timeFrame":"Day 1 (randomization) to 42 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Azacitidine","deltaMin":24.46,"sd":null},{"arm":"Conventional Care","deltaMin":15.02,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0002"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":108,"countries":["United States","Australia","Bulgaria","Czechia","France","Germany","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Netherlands","Poland","Russia","Spain","Sweden","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20026804","20136825","20394651","20451404","19230772","23585522"],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01186939?term=NCT01186939&rank=1"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":114,"n":175},"commonTop":["Thrombocytopenia","Neutropenia","Anaemia","Nausea","Constipation"]}}
