Cells were incubated with 2% serum from each study subject diluted in culture medium and incubations were performed for a total of 4 hours. Cholesterol efflux was calculated as the percent of cholesterol removed from the cells and appearing in the culture medium normalized to a reference serum pool as described in detail by de la Llera-Moya et al (de la Llera-Moya M, Drazul-Schrader D, Asztalos BF, Cuchel M, Rader DJ, Rothblat GH. The ability to promote efflux via ABCA1 determines the capacity of serum specimens with similar high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to remove cholesterol from macrophages.
