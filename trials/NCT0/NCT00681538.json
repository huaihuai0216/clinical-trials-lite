Subject must be either: Currently established on a regular dose of anti-spasticity therapy or Previously tried and failed, or could not tolerate suitable anti-spasticity therapy.\n* Subject is currently receiving a stable regimen (for at least 30 days prior to study entry) of all medications that may have an effect on spasticity; and willing to maintain this for the duration of the study.
