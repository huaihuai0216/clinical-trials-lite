These evaluations will include specific measures of psychosis severity, delirium, dementia, cardiovascular condition, and pregnancy status. Patients may be excluded from the study based on these assessments (and specifically if it is determined that their baseline health and psychiatric condition do not meet all protocol-specified entry criteria).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"40 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Antipsychotic Efficacy","description":"Antipsychotic Efficacy was defined as a decrease in the severity and/or frequency of hallucinations and/or delusions.

The UPDRS Parts II+III score was analyzed by constructing 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the difference between the pimavanserin dose group and placebo mean change from baseline. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper limit of the CI was less than or equal to 5.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.69","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-1.40","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"NA","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.29","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":94},"commonTop":["Urinary tract infection","Fall","Nausea","Edema peripheral","Confusional state"]}}}
