Study visits occurred at 4 week intervals for 12 weeks (with an additional visit at Week 11) with the key measure of efficacy being the 6-minute walk test. Study procedures included routine blood tests, medical history, physical exams, disease evaluation, and exercise tests. Two optional substudies were also a part of FREEDOM-M at select centers - a hemodynamic substudy with a right heart catheterization at Baseline and Week 12 and a genetics and biomarkers substudy with blood samples collected at Baseline and Week 12.\n\nPatients who completed all assessments for 12 weeks were also eligible to enter an open-label, extension phase study (FREEDOM - EXT).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Six Minute Walk Distance (6MWD)","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":339,"sd":null},{"arm":"UT-15C (Oral Treprostinil)","deltaMin":350,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0125"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"12 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":77,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Canada","China","France","India","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Poland","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23307827"],"seeAlso":["http://www.pahstudy.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":77},"commonTop":["headache","nausea","diarrhea","vomiting","flushing"]}}
