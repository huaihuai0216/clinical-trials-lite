While on this study, participants will continue to take their usual, prescribed, stable regimen of Levodopa/Carbidopa or Levodopa/Benserazide therapy plus adjunct Parkinson's medications. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive either Istradefylline 20 mg per day, or Istradefylline 40 mg per day or an equivalent placebo. Patients will be treated for a 12 week period to demonstrate the effectiveness of Istradefylline in improving Parkinson's disease symptoms (referred to as improvement in patient OFF time) and that Istradefylline has an acceptable safety profile in this group.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in the Total Hours of Awake Time/Day Spent in the OFF State at Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline, Week 2, Week 6, Week 10 and Week 12.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":5.17,"sd":null},{"arm":"Istradefylline 20 mg/Day","deltaMin":5.33,"sd":null},{"arm":"Istradefylline 40 mg/Day","deltaMin":4.92,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"30 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":89,"countries":["United States","Canada","Czechia","Germany","Israel","Italy","Poland","Serbia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://foxtrialfinder.michaeljfox.org/trial/3633/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":7,"n":204},"commonTop":["Dyskinesia","Fall","Nausea","Insomnia","Dizziness"]}}
