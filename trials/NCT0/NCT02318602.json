Because adaptive behavior refers to an individual's typical performance of the day-to-day activities required for personal and social sufficiency, these scales assess what a person actually does, rather than what he or she is able to do.\n\nThe Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Survey Interview Form) is a measure of adaptive behavior in children, adolescents and adults. It yields an overall standard score (Adaptive Behavior Composite, ABC) and age standard scores in four domains. The 4 domains are Communication, Daily Living Skills, Motor Skills, and Maladaptive Behaviour Index. ABC scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (range = 20 to 160). Higher scores suggest a higher level of adaptive functioning. A rise in standard scores from Baseline indicates improvement.\n\nThe VABS will be completed for all participants.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.8","spread":"7.34"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"40.4","spread":"37.53"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"40.3","spread":"42.76"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.3","spread":"9.03"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"51.7","spread":"41.79"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"36.0","spread":"41.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.9","spread":"9.30"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"48.6","spread":"38.91"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"34.3","spread":"40.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.0","spread":"7.35"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.4","spread":"13.10"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"18.8","spread":"14.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.6","spread":"7.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21.1","spread":"13.15"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"15.7","spread":"15.95"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.5","spread":"8.73"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.6","spread":"13.15"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"16.8","spread":"14.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.00"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.2","spread":"13.47"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12.9","spread":"17.09"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.3","spread":"2.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.8","spread":"15.98"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"12.8","spread":"17.33"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.00"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.8","spread":"13.88"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10.5","spread":"17.15"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.4","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.8","spread":"18.62"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"19.1","spread":"26.03"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.6","spread":"1.51"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17.8","spread":"19.99"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"18.8","spread":"26.58"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1.0","spread":"2.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.6","spread":"21.29"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"18.8","spread":"29.07"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.4","spread":"1.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.1","spread":"11.85"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.7","spread":"15.70"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.9","spread":"2.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.6","spread":"12.45"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10.7","spread":"16.42"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.8","spread":"2.12"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.9","spread":"13.43"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.2","spread":"15.71"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.6","spread":"6.65"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"31.7","spread":"29.37"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"28.6","spread":"27.98"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.0","spread":"8.93"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"39.2","spread":"29.64"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"26.2","spread":"29.19"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.6","spread":"8.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"36.2","spread":"30.66"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"25.4","spread":"29.78"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.1","spread":"2.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"14.6","spread":"18.34"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"16.9","spread":"20.33"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"2.6","spread":"3.99"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.2","spread":"16.37"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"16.7","spread":"20.81"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3.1","spread":"4.32"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.0","spread":"17.08"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"15.9","spread":"20.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.4","spread":"10.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"28.9","spread":"22.93"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"31.1","spread":"25.41"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11.9","spread":"10.67"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"35.7","spread":"21.85"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"25.8","spread":"22.75"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"14.0","spread":"12.62"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"33.3","spread":"22.67"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"26.7","spread":"24.35"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.3","spread":"9.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20.5","spread":"20.11"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"19.7","spread":"20.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.6","spread":"10.55"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24.4","spread":"19.77"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"19.6","spread":"22.71"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{
