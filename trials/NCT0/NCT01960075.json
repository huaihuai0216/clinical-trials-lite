There are three active treatment arms being compared: fosphenytoin (FOS),levetiracetam (LEV), and valproic acid (VPA).\n\nThe second objective is comparison of three drugs with respect to secondary outcomes.\n\nThe final objective is to ensure that the trial is informative for treatment of established SE in children by describing the effectiveness, safety, and rate of adverse reactions of these drugs in children.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Clinical Cessation of Status Epilepticus - Intention to Treat","timeFrame":"Within 60 minutes after the start of study drug infusion","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Fosphenytoin (FOS)","deltaMin":53,"sd":null},{"arm":"Valproic Acid","deltaMin":56,"sd":null},{"arm":"Levetiracetam","deltaMin":68,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":65,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24001084","21967363","35718575","34032604","33742783","33567109","33336359","32446674","32203691","31774955","31161706"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":57,"n":125},"commonTop":["Convulsion","Hypotension","Pyrexia","Hypocalcaemia","Vomiting"]}}
