analogue scale (VAS) and is used to generate two scores: the utility score and the thermometer score. The utility score measures mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Responses to each of the 5 health states are measured on a 3-point scale (level 1 = no problem; level 2 = some or moderate problem(s) and level 3 = unable, or extreme problems). Responses are typically converted into health utilities or valuations on a scale ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). The thermometer score ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. A Negative health status describes health state worse than death.Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study drug dose date.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":"0.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.22"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":"0.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.24"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.26"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.22"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.0","spread":"0.23"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.24"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.0","spread":"0.34"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.21"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.1","spread":"0.19"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.1","spread":"0.28"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.1","spread":"17.68"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.6","spread":"17.64"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.6","spread":"20.73"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.9","spread":"22.83"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.7","spread":"19.92"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.6","spread":"20.88"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.2","spread":"18.84"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.1","spread":"19.08"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.1","spread":"18.33"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.9","spread":"20.59"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.0","spread":"21.93"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.3","spread":"21.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.0","spread":"17.52"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"13.1","spread":"21.06"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"9.4","spread":"17.86"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.1","spread":"25.40"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.1","spread":"16.42"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.3","spread":"24.16"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.8","spread":"19.50"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"15.2","spread":"21.88"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score","description":"EORTC QLQ-C30, a self-reported, cancer-specific instrument assessing 15 domains: physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning, pain,fatigue, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and dyspnea, financial difficulties and a global health status/quality of life (QOF).
