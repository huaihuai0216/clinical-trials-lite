Tanner Stages is a scale that defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics. It was used in this study to assess pubertal development with values ranging from Stage 1 (pre-pubertal characteristics) to Stage 5 (adult or mature characteristics). Results are presented for the following categories: 1) For female: breast development and pubic hair development, 2) For male: penis development and pubic hair development.
