Concomitant folic/folinic acid at a dose of at least 5 mg/week is to be taken during the study; patients can start treatment with folic/folinic acid at screening if not already receiving it.\n* If the patient is currently taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the patient must be on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study.\n* Patients who are ≥18 and ≤75 years of age at screening.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who are rated as Class IV according to the 1991 ACR revised criteria for classification of global functional status for RA.\n* Patients who have received disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), other than MTX, within a period prior to screening shorter than the washout period appropriate to the pharmacodynamic profile of the specific drug.\n* Patients who have received immunosuppressive drugs within 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients on a stable dose of oral corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for ≥4 weeks prior to screening are permitted.\n* Patients who have received intra-articular, intramuscular, intravenous, or epidural injection of corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* Patients who have received intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injections within 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* Patients who have received surgical therapy for RA such as synovectomy or arthroplasty within 6 months prior to screening.\n* Patients who have received arthrocentesis within 4 weeks prior to screening.\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with infliximab.\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with \\>1 biological drug or \\>1 protein kinase inhibitor for RA either as part of clinical management or during a clinical study.\n* Patients who have had prior treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors for RA who had lack of efficacy as per clinical judgment (primary failure).
