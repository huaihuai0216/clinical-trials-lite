Criteria:\n\nInclusion Criteria:\n\n* Masseter prominence at the Day 1 visit\n* BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2 using the calculation: BMI = weight (kg)/\\[height (m)\\]2\n* A female participant must be willing to minimize the risk of inducing pregnancy for the duration of the clinical study and follow-up periods\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any medical condition that may put the participant at increased medical risk with exposure to BOTOX, including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other condition that might interfere with neuromuscular function\n* An anticipated need for surgery or overnight hospitalization during the study\n* An anticipated need for treatment with botulinum toxin of any serotype for any indication during the study (other than study intervention)\n* History of dental or surgical procedure for lower facial shaping or masseter muscle reduction\n* Prior mid-facial and/or lower facial treatment with nonpermanent soft tissue fillers, synthetic implantations, autologous fat transplantation, fat-reducing injectables, and/or skin-tightening laser treatments within 6 months prior to Day 1\n* Prior exposure to botulinum toxin of any serotype to the masseter muscle or lower face at any time, or to any other part of the body within the 6 months prior to Day 1\n* History of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD)\n* Masseter prominence due to other etiologies (eg, parotid gland infection, parotiditis, malignancy)\n* Known allergy or sensitivity to any of the components of the study treatments or any materials used in the
