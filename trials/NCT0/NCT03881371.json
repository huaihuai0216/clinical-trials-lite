Eligible patients are required to meet the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria. The study involves a placebo group. Placebo will be added to the standard stabilized treatment as a control of the safinamide group, hence patients on placebo will have benefit from other ongoing anti-PD medication. A total of 306 patients will be randomised into this study (153 in the safinamide and 153 in the placebo groups).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Mean Total Daily \"OFF\" Time","timeFrame":"At baseline and Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Safinamide","deltaMin":-1.93,"sd":2.556},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.88,"sd":2.543}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":31,"countries":["China"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38565814","38070039","36346534"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":151},"commonTop":["Dyskinesia","Parkinson's disease","Dizziness","Back pain","Constipation"]}}
