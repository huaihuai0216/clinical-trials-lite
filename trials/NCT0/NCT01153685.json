(Acute disease is defined as the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or without fever). All vaccines can be administered to persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e. oral temperature \\<38.0°C.\n* Significant acute or chronic, uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness. \"Uncontrolled\" is defined as:\n\n  * Requiring institution of new medical or surgical treatment within one (1) month prior to study enrollment, or\n  * Requiring the re-institution of a previously discontinued medication or medical treatment within one month prior to study enrollment, or\n  * Requiring a change in medication dosage in the one month prior to study enrollment due to uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity (elective dosage adjustments in stable subjects are acceptable), or\n  * Hospitalization or an event fulfilling the definition of a SAE within one month prior to study enrollment.\n* Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition including:\n\n  * History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,\n  * Cancer or treatment for cancer, within 3 years of study enrollment. Persons with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for 3 years or more are eligible.\n* History of renal impairment.\n* History of hepatic dysfunction due to hepatitis B, C or toxins including alcohol.\n* Complicated insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\n* Unstable cardiopulmonary disease requiring chronic medical therapy or associated with functional impairment.\n* Presence of blood dyscrasias, including hemoglobinopathies and myelo- or lymphoproliferative disorder.\n* Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids (prednisone \\>= 20 mg/day for more than 14 consecutive days) within 1 month of study enrollment, or any cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs within six months of study enrollment. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.\n* A history of any demyelinating disease including Multiple Sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome.\n* Presence of an active neurological disorder.\n* History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse.\n* Any significant disorder of coagulation that increases the risk of intramuscular injections or treatment with coumadin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic antiplatelet medications, e.g. low-dose aspirin, and without a clinically-apparent bleeding tendency are eligible.\n* Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding the administration of the study vaccine or planned during the study.\n* Any known or suspected allergy to any constituent of Fluviral (egg protein, thimerosal) and/or a history of anaphylactic type reaction to consumption of eggs, and/or reactions to products containing mercury (such as thimerosal).\n* A history of severe adverse reaction to a previous influenza vaccination.\n* Pregnant and/or lactating/nursing female.\n* Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participation in the study.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
