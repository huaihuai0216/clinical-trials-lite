Results will be summarized descriptively with 95% confidence intervals. Determine rate of overall changes in management by comparing planned management strategy using conventional imaging with executed management strategy incorporating information from 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, regardless of treatment modality.\n\nAnalysis: The rate of change in management based on the incorporation of68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results will be expressed as the percentage of total patients imaged in which change in management occurred, regardless of treatment modality. The rate of change in management will also be estimated within each group (initial staging, biochemical recurrence, and pre/post treatment). 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be used to express precision of the estimates.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"12","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"22","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"21","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"7","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":39},"commonTop":[]}}}
