Willing to participate in all aspects of the study and to comply with study procedures, for up to 60 weeks, including:\n\n   * Be randomized\n   * Use study product as directed\n   * Adhere to follow-up schedule and willing to be contacted by site staff between study visits (by phone and/or in person)\n   * Use a study-approved effective non-barrier method of contraception for the duration of the study\n   * Take study product, as evidenced by swallowing a vitamin tablet that is similar in size to the study product at enrollment\n   * Provide contact information and agrees to some form of contact method throughout the study\n7. Not intending to relocate out of the area for the duration of the study participation and does not have a job or other obligations that may require long absences from the area ( \\> 1 month at a time)\n8. In general good health and have no condition (social or medical) which, in the opinion of the Site Investigator, would make study participation unsafe or complicate data interpretation\n9. Not pregnant or breastfeeding, and does not anticipate a desire for pregnancy during the 52 weeks of on-product participation\n10. Medically eligible at screening including:\n\n    * Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) of local range and creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault Creatinine Clearance Formula\n    * Adequate hepatic function (hepatic transaminases ALT and AST \\< 2x ULN \\[according to local normal ranges\\])\n    * HBsAg negative\n    * Serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of the local normal range (according to local normal ranges - grade 3 \\& 4 hypophosphatemia will be excluded even if within normal local ranges)\n11.

No clinical signs of liver disease (e.g., ascites, spider angiomata, hepatomegaly, jaundice)\n13. No definite evidence of glycosuria or proteinuria (i.e., no repeated positive \\[ ≥ + 1 \\] urine dipstick). If a urine dipstick is positive for either glucose and/or protein at the first test, a second urine sample will be tested.\n14. No history of pathological bone fractures\n15.
