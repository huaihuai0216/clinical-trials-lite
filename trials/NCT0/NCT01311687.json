The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 3 levels of response: No problem (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions into a single utility index score. EQ-5D index values range from -0.59 to 1.00 where an EQ-5D score of 1.00 equals \"perfect health\", a score of 0 equals \"death\" and a score of -0.59 equals worst imaginable health state. A positive change from Baseline score indicates improvement in health status. A negative change from Baseline score indicates worsening in health status. Negative scores represent the possible though unlikely situation that a patient's QOL is worse than death, i.e. they would rather be dead than living with that QOL","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.03","spread":"0.28"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.02","spread":"0.23"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.01","spread":"0.29"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.06","spread":"0.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.04","spread":"0.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.07","spread":"0.29"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.01","spread":"0.32"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.04","spread":"0.26"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.03","spread":"0.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.12","spread":"0.19"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Time to First Worsening of Quality of Life (QOL) Domains","description":"Time to worsening in quality of life domains was calculated as the time from Baseline to the first worsened minimally important difference (MID), defined as the smallest change in a QOL score considered important to patients that would lead the patient or clinician to consider a change in therapy.

Based on the MID, participants were classified as worsened according to the following: For the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status and functional scales and the EQ-5D health utility score, participants were classified as worsened if their change from Baseline score was less than -1 SEM. For the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scores (fatigue and pain) and EORTC QLQ-MY20 disease symptoms and side effects scales, participants were classified as worsened if their change from Baseline score was greater than 1 SEM.
