Sexually active males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking study treatment and for 3 days after stopping study (only for patients treated with asciminib). A condom is required for all sexually active male participants on asciminib treatment to prevent them from fathering a child AND to prevent delivery of study treatment via seminal fluid to their partner. In addition, these male participants must not donate sperm for the time period specified above.\n14.
