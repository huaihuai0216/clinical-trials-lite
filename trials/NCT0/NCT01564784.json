The EQ-5D descriptive system measures a participants' health state on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels, reflecting \"no problems\", \"some problems\", and \"extreme problems\". The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5.81","spread":"2.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.90","spread":"4.21"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.13","spread":"2.53"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19.67","spread":"17.80"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.13","spread":"3.37"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"44.00","spread":"NA"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.62","spread":"4.43"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":"NA"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"15.09","spread":"9.14"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"NA","spread":"NA"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.62","spread":"2.38"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.52","spread":"2.88"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Veno-Occlusive Liver Disease (VOD)/Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome (SOS) Following Post Study HSCT","description":"VOD/SOS was defined as the occurrence of 2 out of the following 3 clinical criteria: 1) total serum bilirubin level \\>34 micromoles per liter (μmol/L) (\\>2.0 milligrams per deciliter \\[mg/dL\\]), 2) an increase in liver size from baseline or development of right upper quadrant pain of liver origin and 3) sudden weight gain \\>2.5% (eg, within a 72 hour period) because of fluid accumulation in the weeks following infusion of study drug or chemotherapy, or HSCT conditioning/preparative therapy, or development of ascites not present at baseline following such exposures AND the absence of other explanations for these signs and symptoms, OR development of bilirubin elevation, weight gain, or hepatomegaly plus histologic abnormalities on liver biopsy demonstrating hepatocyte necrosis in zone 3 of the liver acinus, sinusoidal fibrosis, and centrilobular hemorrhage, with or without fibrosis of the terminal hepatic venules.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"22.8","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.6","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":85,"n":164},"commonTop":["Thrombocytopenia","Neutropenia","Anaemia","Nausea","Pyrexia"]}}}
