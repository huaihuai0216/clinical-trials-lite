In addition, cost savings using the cervical block are evaluated (due to reduced length of hospital stay).\n\nThe study is prospective, randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. The study is performed at the Department of Surgery, Cantonal Hospital of St. Gallen.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Post-operative Pain Measured by Visual Analogue Scale","timeFrame":"6 hours after surgery","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervivcal Block Before Surgery","deltaMin":2.15,"sd":2.17},{"arm":"Cervivcal Block After Surgery","deltaMin":2.02,"sd":2.06},{"arm":"Placebo Cervivcal Block Before Surgery","deltaMin":2.84,"sd":1.75},{"arm":"Placebo Cervivcal Block After Surgery","deltaMin":2.72,"sd":1.89}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002 vs OG003","p":".028"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":["20632263"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":41},"commonTop":[]}}
