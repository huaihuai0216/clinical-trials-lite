Patients received either secukinumab, placebo or abatacept (active comparator). The core study was completed. However, the extension study was prematurely terminated after the primary endpoint analysis of the core study at week 24 had demonstrated numerically higher efficacy for the active comparator abatacept compared to secukinumab.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving an American College of Rheumatology Response 20 (ACR20).","timeFrame":"week 24","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AIN457 10mg/kg - 75 mg","deltaMin":28.3,"sd":null},{"arm":"AIN457 10mg/kg - 150 mg","deltaMin":30.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":18.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Abatacept","deltaMin":42.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0458"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"0.0152"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":117,"countries":["United States","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","Colombia","Czechia","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Mexico","Romania","Russia","Slovakia","Spain"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31087226","28217871"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":30,"n":218},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Nasopharyngitis","Rheumatoid arthritis","Headache","Hypertension"]}}
