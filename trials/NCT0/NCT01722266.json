In addition, the time spent at glucose concentrations \\>150 and 200mg/dl and \\<70 and \\<40 mg/dl will also be compared.\n\nAim 1.2: To compare the postprandial glucose concentrations following a test meal before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg of liraglutide daily. Glucose concentrations will be measured as areas under the curve for the data obtained from the meal challenge.\n\nAim 1.3: To compare HbA1c levels(glycated hemoglobin) before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg of liraglutide daily Hypothesis 2: Treatment with Liraglutide in patients with type 1 diabetes decreases postprandial glucagon concentrations and increases postprandial C-peptide concentrations.\n\nAim 2.1: To compare fasting and postprandial glucagon and C-peptide concentrations following a test meal before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg of liraglutide daily.\n\nHypothesis 3: Treatment with Liraglutide in patients with type 1 diabetes delays gastric emptying.\n\nAim 3.1: To compare the gastric emptying as measured by acetaminophen absorption before and after 12 weeks of treatment with 0.6, 1.2 and 1.8 mg of liraglutide daily.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Mean Weekly Glucose Concentrations","timeFrame":"12 Weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1,"sd":0},{"arm":"Liraglutide 1.8mg","deltaMin":-10,"sd":1},{"arm":"Liraglutide 1.2mg","deltaMin":-10,"sd":2},{"arm":"Liraglutide 0.6 mg","deltaMin":-0.3,"sd":2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["23807520","21646283","20207828","19808924","17180352","18996824","17379054","20109994","21856595","20841306","20019672","20404854","27208343"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Transient Nausea"]}}
