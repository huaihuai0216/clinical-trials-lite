Males or females ≥18 years old\n2. Diagnosis of ABSSSI suspected or confirmed to be caused by a Gram-positive pathogen requiring at least 5 days of IV therapy\n3. An ABSSSI includes one of the following infections Wound infections, Cellulitis/erysipelas, Major cutaneous abscess\n4. ABSSSI must present with at least 2 signs and symptoms\n5. Able to give informed consent and willing to comply with all required study procedures\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following exclusion criteria apply prior to randomization:\n\n1. Prior systemic or topical antibacterial therapy with activity against suspected or proven Gram-positive pathogens within the preceding 14 days\n\n   * The causative Gram-positive pathogen(s) isolated from the ABSSSI site is resistant in vitro to the antibacterial(s) that was administered with documented clinical progression, or\n   * Documented failure to previous ABSSSI antibiotic therapy is available.
