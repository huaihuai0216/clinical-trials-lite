The purpose of this study is to assess the relative effectiveness of three HIV testing strategies on increasing receipt of test results: (1) on-site HIV rapid testing with brief, participant-tailored prevention counseling, (2) on-site HIV rapid testing with information only, and (3) referral for off-site HIV testing. The study will also assess the effectiveness of the three testing strategies in reducing HIV risk behaviors.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Self-Report Receipt of HIV Test Results","timeFrame":"One month post-randomization","effectByArm":[{"arm":"HIV Testing Referral","deltaMin":78,"sd":null},{"arm":"HIV Rapid Test & Counseling","deltaMin":338,"sd":null},{"arm":"HIV Rapid Test and Info","deltaMin":347,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001 vs OG002","p":"<0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":12,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22515871","22971593","25291977"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":429},"commonTop":[]}}
