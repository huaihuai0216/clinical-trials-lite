If subject has elevations only in total bilirubin that are \\>ULN and \\<1.5xULN, fractionate bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin \\<35%)\n\nFor randomized subjects with a Baseline result \\>ULN for ALT, AST, ALP, or total bilirubin, a Baseline diagnosis and/or the cause of any clinically meaningful elevation must be understood and recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).\n\nIf subject has \\>ULN ALT, AST, or ALP that does not meet the exclusion limit at screening, repeat the tests, if possible, prior to dosing to ensure there is no further ongoing clinically relevant increase. In case of a clinically relevant increase, inclusion of the subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor.\n\nTests that result in ALT, AST, or ALP up to 25% above the exclusion limit may be repeated once for confirmation. This includes re-screening.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"4 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Time to the Second Primary Generalized Tonic Clonic (PGTC) Seizure During the 24-week Treatment Period From Visit 2 (Week 0) to Visit 10 (Week 24)","description":"The primary efficacy variable was the time to the second primary generalized tonic clonic seizure (PGTCS) during the 24-week Treatment Period.
