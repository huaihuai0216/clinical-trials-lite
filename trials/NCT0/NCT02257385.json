A female is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of: Non-child bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile). Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Post-menopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate, \\> 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy.OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive methods used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of the physician for the duration of the study screening to follow-up contact): Abstinence, Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone, Injectable progestogen, Implants of levonorgestrel, Estrogenic vaginal ring, Percutaneous contraceptive patches, Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) effectiveness criteria as stated in the product label, Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject.
