Although MDD primarily involves mood disturbances, patients also usually present alterations in cognitive function (attention, memory, executive functioning and psychomotor speed). Even though antidepressants are suggested in the literature to potentially improve cognitive dysfunction in patients with MDD to some degree, there is a lack of adequate and well-controlled studies to investigate this effect. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a new antidepressant Vortioxetine versus placebo on cognitive dysfunction in adult patients with MDD.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline to Week 8 in DSST (Number of Correct Symbols) and RAVLT (Acquisition and Delayed Recall) Using the Composite Z-score Defined as the Weighted Sum of the Individual Patient Z-scores","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 8","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-0.235,"sd":0.053},{"arm":"Vortioxetine 10 mg","deltaMin":0.128,"sd":0.052},{"arm":"Vortioxetine 20 mg","deltaMin":0.095,"sd":0.051}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":31},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["33833401","27780334","24787143"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":196},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Nasopharyngitis"]}}
