Recipients of myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens are eligible.\n* Clinically suspected Grade II to IV aGVHD as per MAGIC criteria, occurring after allo-HSCT and any GVHD prophylaxis regimen.\n* Evidence of myeloid engraftment. Use of growth factor supplementation is allowed.\n* Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min measured or calculated by Cockroft Gault equation.\n* Willing to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.\n* Able to give written informed consent and comply with all study visits and procedures.\n* Able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has received more than 1 allo-HSCT.\n* Has received more than 2 days of systemic corticosteroids for aGVHD.\n* Presence of GVHD overlap syndrome.\n* Presence of an active uncontrolled infection.\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n* Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus infection that requires treatment or at risk for HBV reactivation.\n* Participants with evidence of relapsed primary disease, or participants who have been treated for relapse after the allo-HSCT was performed.\n* Any corticosteroid therapy for indications other than GVHD at doses \\> 1 mg/kg per day methylprednisolone (or prednisone equivalent) within 7 days of randomization.\n* Severe organ dysfunction unrelated to underlying GVHD, including:\n\n  * Cholestatic disorders or unresolved veno-occlusive disease of the liver.\n  * Clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease.\n  * Clinically significant respiratory disease that requires mechanical ventilation support or 50% oxygen.\n* Currently breast feeding.\n* Received JAK inhibitor therapy after allo-HSCT for any indication. Treatment with a JAK inhibitor before allo-HSCT is permitted.\n* Treatment with any other investigational agent, device, or procedure within 21 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is greater) of enrollment.\n* Any medical complications or conditions that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full participation in the study, including administration of study drug and attending required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with interpretation of study data.\n* Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to any of the study medications, excipients, or similar compounds.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
