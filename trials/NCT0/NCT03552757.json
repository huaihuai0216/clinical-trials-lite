IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 20-item questionnaire-based instrument used to assess the impact of body weight changes on participant's overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). All IWQOL-Lite-CT composite scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting better levels of functioning. This endpoint shows results for 'physical and psychosocial domains, and for total'. Results are based on the data from in-trial observation period which was defined as the uninterrupted time interval from the start of randomisation (week 0) to last trial-related subject-site contact.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.6","spread":"18.0"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11.0","spread":"19.6"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"4.4","spread":"19.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.6","spread":"15.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.6","spread":"16.7"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.6","spread":"16.5"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"8.2","spread":"14.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.1","spread":"15.9"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"5.2","spread":"15.5"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Participants Who Achieve (Yes/no): Responder Definition Value for SF-36 Physical Functioning Score","description":"The observed number of participants experiencing a meaningful within participant improvement in SF-36 Physical function after 68 weeks was determined based on two thresholds.
