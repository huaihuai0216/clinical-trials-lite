KCCQ was a 23-item, self-administered questionnaire that measure the participant's perception of their health status, including their heart failure (HF) symptoms, impact on physical and social function and how their HF impacts the quality of life. KCCQ quantifies 7 domains: physical limitations (6 items), symptom stability (1 item), symptom frequency (4 items), symptom burden (3 items), self-efficacy (2 items), quality of life (3 items) and social limitations (4 items). Scores were generated for each domain and scaled from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting the worst and 100 the best possible status. KCCQ-TSS was average of domains- symptom frequency and symptom burden, and transformed to a single score which ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (the best possible status), where the higher score reflected better health status.","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4.9","spread":"1.27"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.2","spread":"1.27"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Total Daily Step Count at Week 12","description":"Change from baseline in total daily step count at Week 12 was reported in this outcome measure.
