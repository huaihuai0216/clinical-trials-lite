Setting: University hospital IVF unit. Patients: 60 poor responder patients coming for IVF center for ICSI. Interventions: Minidose long protocol in which half the dose of agonist was administered from the mid luteal phase until the day of HCG administration was compared with microdose flare protocol in which half the dose of GnRH was administered from the second day of the cycle until the day of HCG administration. Both groups received Gn stimulation from the second day of the cycle (300-450 IU).\n\nMain outcome measures: Number of oocytes retrieved.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Oocytes Retrieved","timeFrame":"12 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Minidose Long Protocol","deltaMin":4,"sd":1},{"arm":"Microdose Flare Protocol","deltaMin":3.4,"sd":0.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"35 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":0},"commonTop":[]}}
