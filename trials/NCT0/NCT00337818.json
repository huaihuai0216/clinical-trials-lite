Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This study will evaluate the consistency of consecutive vaccine lots and the non-inferiority of modified manufacturing processes of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals HPV-16/18 vaccine and the vaccine safety, over 12 months, in young adolescents and women of 10-25 years of age at study start.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Titers of Anti-human Papilloma Virus 16 (Anti-HPV-16) and Anti-human Papilloma Virus 18 (Anti-HPV-18) Antibodies","timeFrame":"At months 18*, 24, 36 and 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cervarix New Process","deltaMin":1440.4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cervarix Old Process Group","deltaMin":1903.7,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cervarix Young","deltaMin":3861.7,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"10 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":2,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Estonia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00169494"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":186},"commonTop":[]}}
