The patients will be divided in two groups. In both groups a verbal and clear detailed information will be given on the intraoperative approach. The first group will receive topical tranexamic acid and the second group topical platelet rich plasma; both in the surgical site. Both groups will be assessed before and after the intervention with laboratory results (hemoglobin, hematocrit levels) and drainage drain.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Therapeutic Effect on Hemoglobin Level","timeFrame":"up to 3rd day post operative (Baseline, 24, 48 and 72hrs)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group 1 Tranexamic Acid","deltaMin":13.6,"sd":1.4},{"arm":"Group 2 Platelet Rich Plasma","deltaMin":13.6,"sd":1.5}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24860132","23541868","25007727","25458093","20554319","22241606","24768543","24034510","23906869","24726174","24196467","24971180","24851794","24114251","22035976","16816947"],"seeAlso":["http://labtestsonline.org/tests/hematocrit"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":19},"commonTop":[]}}
