throughout the duration of study treatment and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Life expectancy ≥ 1 year\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* A new acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening\n* Receiving drug treatment for hepatitis C, or anticipated to receive treatment for hepatitis C\n* Subjects experiencing decompensated cirrhosis\n* Females who are breastfeeding\n* Positive serum pregnancy test (female of childbearing potential)\n* Implanted defibrillator or pacemaker\n* Current

Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or resected, noninvasive cutaneous squamous carcinoma\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to baseline\n* Medications contraindicated for use with EVG, COBI, FTC, TDF, ATV, or ritonavir or subjects with any known allergies to the excipients of Stribild tablets, Truvada tablets, ATV capsules or ritonavir tablets\n* Participation in any other clinical trial without prior approval\n* Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the dosing requirements","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
