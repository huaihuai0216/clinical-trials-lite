Each of the 12 questions is assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time; 4 = all of the time) which is converted to a total score between 0-100. OSDI total scores of 0-12=normal (best), 13-22= mild ocular surface disease, 23-32 =moderate ocular surface disease, and 33-100=severe ocular surface disease (worst).

The average of 3 consecutive observations is reported for each participant. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. The eye with the shorter average TBUT at Baseline was used for analysis.
