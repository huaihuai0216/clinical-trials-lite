Subject requires a procedure involving a Class 1/clean wound (uninfected surgical wound in which no inflammation is encountered)\n\nIntra-Operative Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Subject's linear extent of durotomy is ≥2 cm\n* Subject's dural margins from the edges of bony defect are ≥3 mm throughout\n* Subject's CSF leak is present intra-operatively following completion of primary dural closure (with or without non-autologous duraplasty or autologous tissue), either spontaneously or upon Valsalva maneuver, at up to 20 cm H2O for up to five (5) seconds\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subject requires a procedure involving a translabyrinthine, transsphenoidal, transoral approach, or any procedure that penetrates the air sinus or mastoid air cells. Note: Superficial penetration of mastoid air cells is not an exclusion if cells are appropriately sealed (e.g. bone wax).\n* Subject has a CSF shunt such as; ventriculo-peritoneal, ventriculo-pleural, ventriculo-atrial or lumbo-peritoneal shunts.\n* Subject has an external ventricular or lumbar CSF drain that must be left in place after surgery.\n* Subject has had radiation treatment to the surgical site, or standard fractionated radiation therapy is planned within ten days post index-procedure. (Note: stereotactic radiosurgery prior to the planned index procedure is not an exclusion criterion).\n* Subject has a systemic infection or evidence of any infection near planned operative site.\n\nIntra-Operative Exclusion Criteria\n\n* Subject has an Incidental finding that meets any pre-operative exclusion criterion listed above.\n* Subject requires the intra-operative placement of a CSF diversion device (e.g. ventricular catheter, subdural catheter, lumbar drain, or other device designed to externally evacuate CSF) that will be left in place after the procedure. Note: Subgaleal drains used for acute post-operative management of the incision site are permitted.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Proportion of Treated Subjects Who Were Free of Intra-operative Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Leakage From Dural Repair During Valsalva Maneuver, CSF Leak / Pseudomeningocele, and Unplanned Retreatment of the Original Surgical Site","description":"The primary endpoint was a composite evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of Adherus for a cranial application.
