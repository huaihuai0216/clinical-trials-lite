Magnesium has hypotensive effect and probably reduce intraoperative blood loss. Whether or not magnesium sulphate can reduce intraoperative blood loss and improve postoperative cognitive function is still inconclusive. So the investigators conduct the randomized control trial to compare the effect of magnesium with placebo control in blood loss and cognitive function in meningioma patient undergoing craniotomy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Intraoperative Blood Loss","timeFrame":"Intraoperative period from skin was incised to the skin was closure, an average 5 hours.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Group NSS","deltaMin":510,"sd":null},{"arm":"Group Mg","deltaMin":500,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.315"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24137015","20821343","27599143","28283245","28584351","27803982","21364460","28494889","27840841","24649414","27123421","16670112","19199498","23562933","24105697","25824556","28930850"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":1,"n":38},"commonTop":["Minor neurological complication","Infection"]}}
