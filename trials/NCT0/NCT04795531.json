However, short term insulin treatment for a maximum of 14 days prior to the day of screening is allowed, as is prior insulin treatment for gestational diabetes.\n* Stable daily dose(s) greater than or equal to 90 days prior to the day of screening of any of the following anti-diabetic drug(s) or combination regimen(s):\n\n  a.) Any metformin formulations greater than or equal to 1500 mg or maximum tolerated or effective dose. b.) Any metformin combination formulations greater than or equal to 1500 mg or maximum tolerated or effective dose. c.) Any of the following oral anti-diabetic drug classes including combinations (greater than or equal to half of the maximum approved dose according to local label or maximum tolerated or effective dose).:Sulfonylureas - Meglitinides (glinides) - DPP-4 inhibitors - SGLT2 inhibitors - Thiazolidinediones - Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - Oral combination products (for the allowed individual Oral Anti-diabetic Drugs (OADs)) - Oral or injectable GLP-1-receptor agonists\n* Body mass index (BMI) below or equal to 40.0 kg/m\\^2.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any episodes (as declared by the subject or in the medical records) of diabetic ketoacidosis within 90 days prior to the day of screening.\n* Myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalisation for unstable angina pectoris or transient ischaemic attack within 180 days prior to the day of screening.\n* Chronic heart failure classified as being in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV at screening.\n* Anticipated initiation or change in concomitant medications (for more than 14 consecutive days) known to affect weight or glucose metabolism (e.g. treatment with orlistat, thyroid hormones, or corticosteroids).\n* Uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy. Verified by a fundus examination performed within the past 90 days prior to screening or in the period between screening and randomisation. Pharmacological pupil-dilation is a requirement unless using a digital fundus photography camera specified for non-dilated examination.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","description":"Change in HbA1c from baseline (week 0) to week 26 is presented.
