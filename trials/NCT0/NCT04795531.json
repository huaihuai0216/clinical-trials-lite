Participants will get a pen for weekly injection and one for daily injection. One will be icodec or degludec and the other will be dummy medicine. The treatment participants get is decided by chance. Participants and the study staff will not know which active medicine they get.\n\nThe insulin is injected with a needle in a skin fold in the thigh. The study could last for about 8 months. Participants will have 13 clinic visits and 17 phone calls with the study doctor. At 8 clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 4 clinic visits participants cannot eat or drink (except for water) for 8 hours before the visit.\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the study period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c)","timeFrame":"Baseline (Week 0), Week 26","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Insulin Icodec","deltaMin":-1.57,"sd":0.05},{"arm":"Insulin Degludec","deltaMin":-1.36,"sd":0.05}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":5},"locations":{"siteCount":93,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Austria","Brazil","Canada","China","Czechia","Denmark","France","Mexico","Puerto Rico","Taiwan"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36106652","40465144","40186685","40016570","37354562"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":293},"commonTop":["COVID-19","Influenza","Diabetic retinopathy"]}}
