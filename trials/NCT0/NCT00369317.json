Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Event-free Survival (EFS) at 3 Years","timeFrame":"Time from study entry to induction failure, relapse, or death assessed at 3 years.","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Treatment (Combination Chemotherapy)","deltaMin":90.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":97,"countries":["United States","Australia","Canada","Puerto Rico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28389462"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":204},"commonTop":["Infections and infestations - Other","Febrile neutropenia","Anorexia","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Catheter related infection"]}}
