The objective of the study is to demonstrate that netupitant and palonosetron are more effective than palonosetron alone, to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy after administration of repeated cycles of chemotherapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Patients With Complete Response (CR) Defined as no Emesis, no Rescue Medication, at Cycle 1","timeFrame":"25-120 hours","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Netupitant and Palonosetron Plus Dexamethasone","deltaMin":76.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Palonosetron Plus Dexamethasone","deltaMin":69.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":22},"locations":{"siteCount":172,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Belarus","Brazil","Bulgaria","Croatia","Germany","Hungary","India","Italy","Mexico","Poland","Romania","Russia","Ukraine"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30968588","28285236"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":725},"commonTop":["Neutropenia","Alopecia","Leukopenia","Asthenia","Headache"]}}
