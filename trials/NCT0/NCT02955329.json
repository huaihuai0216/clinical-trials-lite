The study is designed as a within-subjects single-blinded crossover study. Fourteen smokers of tobacco cigarettes and cannabis will switch between three conditions, namely: (a) vaping cannabis leaf, (b) vaping tobacco containing nicotine and (c) vaping a combination of cannabis leaf and tobacco containing nicotine. All participants will vape each product with the PAX loose-leaf vaporizer. The study will be conducted during three outpatient visits separated by at least 48 hours. The order of treatment (cannabis leaf, tobacco with nicotine, cannabis leaf \\& tobacco with nicotine) will be counterbalanced between subjects. Subjects will be blinded to the content of the vaporizer on the study day but will be told during screening that they will vape cannabis alone, tobacco alone, and cannabis plus tobacco with nicotine.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Delivered and Retained Doses","timeFrame":"Study Day 1-3","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tobacco Arm","deltaMin":0.016,"sd":0.003},{"arm":"Cannabis Arm","deltaMin":0.018,"sd":0.008},{"arm":"Combined Cannabis and Tobacco Arm","deltaMin":0.026,"sd":0.008}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25239961","25879896","26430813","28393086","26277652","26347431","19515745","14678065"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":8},"commonTop":[]}}
