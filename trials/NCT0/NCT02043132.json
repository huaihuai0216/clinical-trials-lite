We propose a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial comparing perioperative administration of TXA to placebo in the setting of RTSA. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of TXA in reducing overall blood loss and transfusion rates in patients undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Total Blood Loss","timeFrame":"Preoperative through Postoperative Days 1 and 2","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Tranexamic Acid","deltaMin":1122.4,"sd":411.6},{"arm":"Normal Saline","deltaMin":1472,"sd":475.4}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22938787","19119020","19664937","16757754","16337526","15239556","10400410","1373346","255562","6159375","18067499","8636182","16531440","11704449","12697586","9085968","10673876","20640094","20171048","16487712","11476309","12421192","21048170","18277670","17966532","11011672","16470437","15188109","11728069","11049894","16156456","14709457","15224162","22623147","22161917","21196541","19007970","21936146","9354828","15446520"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":53},"commonTop":["Skin Allergic Reaction","Syncopal fall"]}}
