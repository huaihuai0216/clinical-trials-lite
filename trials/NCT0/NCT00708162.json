Documented resistance or at least six months experience prior to screening with two or more different classes of antiretroviral agents\n* Stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 30 days prior to screening: however, participants may discontinue the antiretroviral regimen after screening and remain off therapy until baseline at the discretion of the investigator\n* Eligible to receive one of the fully-active ritonavir-boosted-PIs, and an allowed second agent\n* Normal ECG\n* Adequate renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula ≥ 60 mL/min)\n* Hepatic transaminases ≤ 5 × upper limit of normal\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, or normal direct bilirubin\n* Adequate hematologic function (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mm\\^3; platelets ≥ 50,000/mm\\^3; hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL)\n* Serum amylase \\< 1.5 × the upper limit of the normal range\n* Negative serum pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only)\n* Males and females of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraception methods\n* Age ≥ 18 years\n* Life expectancy ≥ 1 year\n* Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* New AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening\n* Prior treatment with any HIV-1 integrase inhibitor\n* Participants experiencing ascites\n* Participants experiencing encephalopathy\n* Females who are breastfeeding\n* Positive serum pregnancy test at any time during the study (female of childbearing potential)\n* Participants receiving ongoing therapy with any disallowed medication\n* Current alcohol or substance use judged by the investigator to potentially interfere with study compliance\n* Malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma or basal cell carcinoma\n* Active, serious infections (other than HIV-1 infection) requiring parenteral antibiotic or antifungal therapy within 30 days prior to baseline\n* Participation in any other clinical trial (except for the etravirine or maraviroc expanded access program), without prior approval from sponsor\n* Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that would make participants unsuitable for the study\n* Known hypersensitivity to study drug, metabolites or formulation excipients","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18
