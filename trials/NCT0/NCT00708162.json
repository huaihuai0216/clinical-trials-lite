Due to known drug interactions, participants in the Elvitegravir group receiving RTV-boosted atazanavir (ATV) or RTV-boosted lopinavir (LPV) as part of their background regimen will receive elvitegravir at a lower dose (85 mg).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving and Maintaining Confirmed HIV-1 RNA < 50 Copies/mL at Week 48","timeFrame":"Week 48","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Elvitegravir","deltaMin":59,"sd":null},{"arm":"Raltegravir","deltaMin":57.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":15,"exclusionCount":13},"locations":{"siteCount":180,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Canada","France","Germany","Italy","Mexico","Netherlands","Portugal","Puerto Rico","Spain","Switzerland","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["22015077"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":73,"n":354},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Upper respiratory tract infection","Cough","Headache","Nausea"]}}
