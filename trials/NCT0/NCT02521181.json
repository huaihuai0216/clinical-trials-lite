Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda, may help prevent kidney failure in people with chronic kidney disease. However, the dose to prescribe in order to test this possibility in a clinical trial is uncertain. The BASE pilot clinical trial will help determine the best dose of sodium bicarbonate to prescribe in a future study that will test the long-term safety and efficacy of sodium bicarbonate as a treatment to preserve kidney function in individuals with chronic kidney disease.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants in Each Dose Arm Prescribed (i) Full Randomized Sodium Bicarbonate Dose at End of 28 Weeks & (ii) at Least 25% of Randomized Sodium Bicarbonate Dose at End of 28 Weeks as a Proportion of the Number Randomized to That Group","timeFrame":"Baseline, 28 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Lower Dose Sodium Bicarbonate","deltaMin":50,"sd":null},{"arm":"Higher Dose Sodium Bicarbonate","deltaMin":78,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":45,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":7,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38170601"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":52},"commonTop":["Mild gastrointestinal symptoms","Moderate gastrointestinal symptoms","Severe gastrointestinal symptoms"]}}
