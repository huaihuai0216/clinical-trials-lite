Infection with the S. aureus bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics is a cause of SSTIs. Three oral antibiotics will be tested for off patent treatment. Patients will receive Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), placebo (substance containing no medication), clindamycin, or cephalexin or some combination of these. The study population will include 2,235 volunteers, children 13 years of age and over and adults presenting to 5 large urban Emergency Departments. Therapy for acute uncomplicated SSTIs, including abscess, infected wound, and cellulitis will start on the day of enrollment. Participants may be involved in study related procedures for about 9 weeks.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Clinical Cure as of the Test-of-Cure (TOC) Visit in the Per Protocol Population","timeFrame":"Days 14-21","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Abscess, Placebo","deltaMin":457,"sd":null},{"arm":"Abscess, TMP/SMX","deltaMin":487,"sd":null},{"arm":"Infected Wound, TMP/SMX","deltaMin":182,"sd":null},{"arm":"Infected Wound, Clindamycin","deltaMin":187,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cellulitis, Cephalexin and TMP/SMX","deltaMin":182,"sd":null},{"arm":"Cellulitis, Cephalexin","deltaMin":165,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"13 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":7,"exclusionCount":27},"locations":{"siteCount":5,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30926187","28987525","28535235","27025829","26962903"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":30,"n":617},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Nausea","Headache","Abscess","Vomiting"]}}
