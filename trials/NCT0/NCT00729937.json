Fever, leukocytosis, and lymphangitis will be noted, but are not enrollment criteria. SSTI with these local findings will be further categorized and defined as one of:\n\n  1. Abscess - a fluctuant and/or indurated lesion, or findings of a fluid-filled cavity on soft tissue ultrasound evaluation that, when opened reveals purulent material, receiving incision and drainage (I\\&D) (considered standard care for abscess) and having a minimum diameter (along any axis) of at least 2 cm (measured from the borders of induration, if a fluctuant lesion, or borders of the abscess cavity on ultrasound, if not fluctuant).\n\n     Note: Although I\\&D of an abscess is considered standard care (i.e., patients will receive I\\&D whether or not they are enrolled in the study), the procedure may be performed after enrollment into the study so that prior measurements of the area of erythema and swelling/induration can be obtained unless it is an occult abscess in which the I\\&D will be performed prior to enrollment to verify infection type and ensure correct classification of the subject.\n  2. Infected Wound - a wound (defined as any apparent break in the skin) with any apparent drainage limited in depth to only involving skin and subcutaneous tissue, including sutured cutaneous wounds not involving intra-abdominal surgeries contaminated with bacterial or bowel contents (e.g., colon surgery and empyema drainage), and\n  3. Cellulitis - an area of erythema without the presence of a wound with drainage or abscess; Cellulitis associated with an abscess will be categorized as an abscess. Cellulitis associated with an infected wound will be classified as an infected wound. Patients with cellulitis and an abscess less than 2 cm will be excluded. Infected wound associated with an abscess that may require I\\&D, will be classified as an infected wound.\n* Have the infected lesion for 7 days or less duration;\n* Are to receive outpatient treatment at enrollment/baseline;\n* Express willingness and ability to be contacted and return for re-evaluation according to the study protocol;\n* Provide written informed consent (and for subjects ages 13-17, consent from their guardian and assent);\n* Negative pregnancy test for subjects who are women of childbearing potential.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Severe allergy or reaction to study drug or drugs similar to the study drug relevant to whichever study sub-trial the subject would be assigned to (e.g., patients with severe or life-threatening penicillin allergies, allergy to any cephalosporin, clindamycin, or sulfonamides, or any other drug containing sulfur such as thiazides, furosemide, and oral sulfonylureas);\n* Concomitant treatment (i.e., while on study drug therapy) with coumadin, phenytoin, or methotrexate, or suspected G-6-PD or folic acid deficiency;\n* Expected inability to swallow or absorb the study drug (assessed by patient history);\n* Pregnancy, nursing, or expectation of becoming pregnant while on study drug;\n* Perirectal (within 5 cm of anus), perineal non-skin lesions (i.e., mucosal), or paronychial location of infection. Scrotal and labial abscesses will not be excluded.\n* An infection due to a mammalian bite;\n* Treatment with a study drug relevant to their infection type, or another systemic antibiotic in the previous 48 hours (i.e., before screening/baseline) unless associated with treatment failure which is defined as a patient who has been on prior (non study drug) antibiotics for at least 72 hours and failed.\n* Expected concurrent treatment with a topical antibiotic or another systemic antibiotic up to Test-of-Cure Visit (TOC) (note: if patient was using a topical antibiotic previously, they can still be enrolled if they agree to stop using it);\n* Immunodeficiency \\[e.g., absolute neutrophil count \\<500/mm\\^3, chronic immunosuppressive drugs, active chemotherapy, or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (CD4 count \\<200 or AIDS-defining illness within the last year) assessed by patient history\\]. Note: patients who had prior AIDS-defining illness or CD4 count \\<200 in the past may be enrolled if most recent CD4 count \\>200;\n* Burn or active chronic skin condition (e.g., including rash or eczema) related to the skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI) at screening/baseline;\n* Infection related to currently indwelling device (e.g., intravenous line), excepting sutures associated with qualifying infected wounds which will be removed upon enrollment;\n* Infection for which prior cultures reveal in vitro resistance of a pathogen to a study drug in the previous month prior to screening/baseline;\n* Known or suspected osteomyelitis or septic arthritis;\n* Infection related to diabetic foot, decubitus, or ischemic ulcer;\n* Known severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance \\< 50 mL/min) calculated by measurement of serum creatinine if patient provides this history or based on past studies at baseline/enrollment;\n* Prior enrollment in this study within 12 weeks;\n* Another active infection of another organ system (e.g., pneumonia) or more than one active (i.e., currently on antibiotic treatment and/or requiring I\\&D) SSTI site (e.g., a site noncontiguous with the infection under study). Note: Minor folliculitis at secondary site is not an exclusion;\n* Presence of an abscess that has completely drained, either spontaneously or by a healthcare provider prior to enrollment;\n* An infected wound or cellulitis that has been surgically explored (\\>1 cm incision) and does not reveal an abscess. Cellulitis that has been needled, minimally incised (less than or equal to 1 cm) or punch biopsied and no purulent drainage found can still be enrolled;\n* Currently incarcerated in a detention facility or in police custody (note: patients wearing a monitoring device can be enrolled) at baseline/screening;\n* For patients with an infected wound, history of C. difficile infection, pseudomembranous colitis, or active diarrhea at baseline/screening;\n* For patients with an infected wound, severe liver disease based on patient history;\n* An intravenous (IV) drug user in the last month with current presence of fever;\n* Current residence in a nursing home or other long term care facility at baseline/screening;\n* Expected use of other investigational drug or vaccine while on study drug;\n* For patients with an abscess, cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from endocarditis for which prophylaxis is reasonable, including patients with prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, history of previous infective endocarditis, congenital heart disease (excluding mitral valve prolapse), and history of cardiac transplantation recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy;\n* Presence of an organic foreign body, e.g., wood (note: subjects with embedded non-organic materials, e.g., metal or glass, that can be completely removed can still be enrolled if physician is certain there is no foreign body left).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"13 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants With Clinical Cure as of the TOC Visit in the Intent to Treat Population","description":"Clinical cure at TOC was defined as no failure on any previous visit up through the TOC, absence of fever, and resolution or minimal presence of all the following signs and symptoms from baseline based on clinician assessment of erythema, swelling, and tenderness.
