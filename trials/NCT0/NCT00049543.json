Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known if gefitinib may be an effective treatment in preventing tumors from returning after they have been removed by surgery.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"From randomization to the time of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm I (Gefitinib)","deltaMin":0.52,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm II (Placebo)","deltaMin":0.57,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.14"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":21,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Canada"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":34,"n":249},"commonTop":["Dyspnea","Fatigue","Rash","Diarrhea","Pain Chest/thorax NOS"]}}
