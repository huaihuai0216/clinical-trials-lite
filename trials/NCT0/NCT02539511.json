The pharmacological facilitation of behavioral treatment represents a promising strategy for addressing disordered drinking. Alcohol use disorders are recognized to be associated with various vulnerabilities that complicate the course of treatment and that may be amenable to glutamate modulators. The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, controlled trial is to test various glutamate modulators in conjunction with motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for alcohol use disorders.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Demonstrating Alcohol Abstinence in the Control (Midazolam) Group Versus the Active (Ketamine) Group","timeFrame":"21 days post-infusion","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Control Group: Midazolam+MET","deltaMin":68.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"Active Group: Ketamine+MET","deltaMin":98.6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"21 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31786934"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["Sedation","Headache","Mild agitation"]}}
