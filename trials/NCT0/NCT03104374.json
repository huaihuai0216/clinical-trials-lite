Period 1 was designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) and 30 mg QD versus placebo in participants with moderately to severely active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) who had an inadequate response to Biological Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (bDMARDs). Period 2 evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who completed Period 1.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response at Week 12","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 12","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":24.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Upadacitinib 15 mg","deltaMin":56.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Upadacitinib 30 mg","deltaMin":63.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":165,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","Czechia","France","Greece","Hungary","Italy","Japan","Netherlands","New Zealand","Portugal","Puerto Rico","South Korea","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["40875187","38683479","38331400","37982966","37945286","37404160","36754548","35606663","34970731","34864911","34661885","34464029","33913086","33272960"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":211},"commonTop":["NASOPHARYNGITIS","UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION","URINARY TRACT INFECTION","PSORIATIC ARTHROPATHY","BRONCHITIS"]}}
