It may also be used in the evaluation of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. IL-6 is a cytokine, a protein produced by immune cells that acts on other cells to help regulate and/or promote an immune response. It also stimulates the production of acute phase reactants, proteins that increase in the blood with conditions that cause inflammation or tissue injury. Circulating IL-6 can be found in the blood of normal individuals in the 1 pg/mL range, with slight elevations during the menstrual cycle, modest elevations in certain cancers (melanoma) (10 pg/mL), and large elevations after surgery (30-430 pg/mL).Units: pg/ml","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"107.9","spread":"124.8"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"89.1","spread":"138.2"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"81.8","spread":"97.4"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"88.6","spread":"85.2"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Interleukin-8 (IL-8) Levels From Admission Baseline at One Week.","description":"IL-8 is a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils, and T-cells, but not monocytes.
