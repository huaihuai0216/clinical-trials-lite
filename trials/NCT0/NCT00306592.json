SAEs: an event that results in death; an event that, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); an outcome that results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect diagnosed in a child of a participant; an event that requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization; an event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Treatment-emergent AEs: events in participants who had received at least 1 dose of study drug, regardless of relationship to study drug.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"826","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"487","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"66","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"161","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"61","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Hypersensitivity-related Adverse Events","description":"For purposes of this analysis, the terms 'hypersensitivity' and 'drug hypersensitivity' were categorized by their temporal relationship to study drug infusion (within 2 hours of the start of the infusion), and were considered equivalent.
