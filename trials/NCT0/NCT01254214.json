Participants will be randomly assigned to tMBSR or to a support group emphasizing communication skills and selecting resources. Both 8-week programs include an initial in-person meeting, 6 weekly teleconference calls, and conclude with an in-person meeting. Participants will complete questionnaires at 3 timepoints over 6 months, and if they receive a transplant, will complete additional questionnaires. Participants will complete sleep diaries and wear Actiwatches (similar to a wristwatch) for one week before programs start, and when programs end, to measure sleep. Participants will provide saliva samples, over 3 days before programs start, and again when programs end, to measure salivary cortisol, an indicator of stress. tMBSR participants will record daily home meditation practice.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"State-Trait Anxiety Inventory","timeFrame":"Baseline, 8 weeks, 26 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"tMBSR","deltaMin":42.1,"sd":12.7},{"arm":"Support Group","deltaMin":37.8,"sd":12.7}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":10,"exclusionCount":6},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19254938","15154154","16013466","19176898","37651553","28342990","25847578"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":27},"commonTop":[]}}
