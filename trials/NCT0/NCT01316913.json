Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will complete a 7 to10 day run-in period followed by a randomization visit (Visit 2) then a 24-week treatment period. There will be a total of 9 clinic study visits. A follow-up phone contact for adverse event assessment will be conducted approximately one week after the last study visit (Visit 9 or Early Withdrawal). The total duration of subject participation in the study will be approximately 26 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy is clinic visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on Treatment Day 169. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 169","timeFrame":"Baseline and Day 169","effectByArm":[{"arm":"UMEC 125 µg QD","deltaMin":0.186,"sd":0.0178},{"arm":"UMEC/VI 62.5/25 µg QD","deltaMin":0.208,"sd":0.018},{"arm":"UMEC/VI 125/25 QD","deltaMin":0.223,"sd":0.0179},{"arm":"TIO18 µg QD","deltaMin":0.149,"sd":0.0176}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.377"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG003","p":"0.018"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.142"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"0.003"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":8,"exclusionCount":29},"locations":{"siteCount":100,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Canada","Chile","Germany","Mexico","Romania","South Africa","South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27796912","24835833"],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":15,"n":222},"commonTop":["Headache","Nasopharyngitis","Upper respiratory tract infection","Back pain","Cough"]}}
