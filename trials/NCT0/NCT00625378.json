Patients were able to continue treatment until (i) the treating physician felt the patient was no longer benefiting from the treatment or (ii) the treatment becomes commercially available and reimbursed for the respective indication as applicable in the country in which the patient lived and the patient could obtain suitable amounts of drug for treatment through standard mechanisms of commercial availability (ie, there should be no interruption in the patient's treatment schedule when switching to commercially available product) or (iii) the patient could join a Post-Trial-Access Program, another study or can receive sorafenib through any other mechanism (e.g. local access program) in accordance with local legal and compliance rules, with no cost to the patient with respect to sorafenib.\n\nAn additional objective was the assessment of the safety of Nexavar or Nexavar combination treatment.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Sorafenib Treatment Duration Within STEP","timeFrame":"From the date of the first sorafenib dose until the date of the last sorafenib dose, with a mean duration of 25 months and max duraton of 153.8 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Sorafenib Monotherapy","deltaMin":15.69,"sd":null},{"arm":"Sorafenib+Erlotinib","deltaMin":40.13,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"16 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":9,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":74,"countries":["United States","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Bulgaria","Canada","China","Colombia","France","Germany","Hong Kong","Italy","New Zealand","Poland","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/","https://clinicaltrials.bayer.com/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":114,"n":203},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome","Fatigue","Hypertension","Decreased appetite"]}}
