Subjects aged 60-85 years old inclusively.\n2. Subjects with verified diagnosis of vascular dementia.\n3. Presence of all the vascular dementia criteria according to NINDS-AIREN:\n\n   A. Presence of dementia, which is defined as a decline in cognitive function relative to the previous level of functioning, manifested by impairments in memory and two or more cognitive domains (orientation, attention, language, visuospatial functions, executive functions, motor control and praxis), preferably established during a clinical trial and confirmed by neuropsychological testing.\n\n   The cognitive impairment must be so severe that it affects daily activity, reducing it independently of the physical consequences of the stroke.\n\n   B. The presence of cerebrovascular disease, confirmed by signs of focal damage on neurological examination, such as hemiparesis, lower facial weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit, hemianopsia or dysarthria associated with stroke (either a history of stroke or absence of such anamnestic information), and neuroimaging (CT or MRI) signs of cerebrovascular disease, including multiple infarcts in the territory of large vessels, or a single infarction in a strategically important area (angular gyrus, thalamus, basal ganglia, or the territory of the anterior or posterior cerebral arteries), as well as multiple lacunae in the region of the basal ganglia or white matter, or significant damage to the periventricular white matter, or a combination of the above lesions.\n\n   C. There is an association between dementia and cerebrovascular disease as follows:\n   1. onset of dementia within 3 months of stroke;\n   2. sharp deterioration of cognitive functions; or fluctuating, stepwise progression of cognitive impairment.\n4. Availability of permanent caregiver throughout the study (nurse or relatives).\n5. Total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score - 10-24.\n6. Total MoCA score \\<26.\n7. Total NPI-C aggression and agitation domain score ≥14.\n8. Аbsence of depression (total Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) score ≤10).\n9. Brain MRI confirming the diagnosis of vascular dementia within 1 year prior to enrollment (or brain MRI performed at enrollment visit).\n10.

Toxicity-related dementia (including drug-induced), multiorgan failure or metabolic and toxic disorders (chronic hypothyroidism, decompensated diabetes mellitus, avitaminoses, etc.).\n5. Other psychiatric diseases besides dementia: mental disorders and behavioral disorders due to use of psychoactive substances (F10-19) schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (F20-29).\n6. Mental retardation (F70-79).\n7. Inflammatory lesions of the brain with persistent neurological deficit.\n8. Malignant neoplasms.\n9. Previously diagnosed cardiovascular diseases with functional class IV (according to New York Heart Association, 1964).\n10. Unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke within the last 6 months.\n11. Female patients with childbearing potency.\n12. Allergy/intolerance of any of the study drugs components including secondary to lactase deficiency.\n13. Any conditions which, according to the investigator opinion, may interfere with the patient's participation in the study.\n14. History of treatment noncompliance, mental diseases, alcoholism or drug abuse which will prevent from following the study procedures, according to investigator's opinion.\n15. Participation in clinical trials for 3 months prior to enrollment in this study.\n16. Use of any medications specified in \"Prohibited concomitant medications\" within 1 month before enrollment.\n17. Patients who are related to any of the on-site research personnel directly involved in the conduct of the trial or are an immediate relative of the study investigator. 'Immediate relative' means husband, wife, parent, son, daughter, brother, or sister (regardless of whether they are natural or adopted).\n18. Patients who work for OOO \"NPF \"Materia Medica Holding\" (i.e. the company's employees, temporary contract workers, designated officials responsible for carrying out the research or any immediate relatives of the aforementioned).","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"60 Years","maximumAge":"85 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Change in Mean Montreal Сognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score","description":"MoCA is the test for assessment of cognitive impairment.
