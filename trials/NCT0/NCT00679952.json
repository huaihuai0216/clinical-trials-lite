We propose that active drainage of pancreatic juice using suction drainage might maximize the advantage of a stent and finally reduce pancreaticojejunal anastomosis leakage.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Patients With Pancreatic Fistula","timeFrame":"postoperative 1 week","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Closed Suction Drainage Group","deltaMin":9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Natural Drainage Group","deltaMin":8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"15 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["South Korea"]},"refs":{"pmids":["8284756","10460636","17717446","17879405"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":86},"commonTop":[]}}
