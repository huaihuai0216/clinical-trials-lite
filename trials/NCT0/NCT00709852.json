The purpose of this study is to look at the safety (what are the side effects) and efficacy (how well does it work) of gadobutrol when used for taking MR images of the brain and spine. The results of the MRI with gadobutrol Injection will be compared to the results of MR images taken without contrast and with the results of the MR images taken with ProHance.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Scores for Three Visualization Parameters (Contrast Enhancement, Border Delineation and Internal Morphology) for Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Compared to Unenhanced MRI by Blinded Reader 1 (BR1)","timeFrame":"Up to 2 hours after injection of gadobutrol","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Unenhanced","deltaMin":0.94,"sd":0.14},{"arm":"Combined Unenhanced/Gadobutrol-enhanced","deltaMin":2.21,"sd":0.57}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"< 0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":79,"countries":["United States","Australia","Austria","Colombia","Germany","India","Japan","Switzerland"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":399},"commonTop":["Nausea","Headache","Diarrhoea","Dizziness","Dysgeusia"]}}
