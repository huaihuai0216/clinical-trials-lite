CVC occlusion\n* Able to have fluids infused at the volume necessary to instill study drug into the CVC\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Able to have 3 mL of blood (patients weighing ≥ 10 kg) or 1 mL of blood (patients weighing \\< 10 kg) withdrawn from the selected CVC following patient repositioning\n* Selected study CVC inserted \\< 2 days prior to treatment\n* Selected study CVC implanted specifically for hemodialysis (HD) or internally coated with any therapeutic agent\n* Use of a power injector on the selected study CVC during study drug treatment\n* Evidence of mechanical, non-thrombotic occlusion of the selected study CVC (e.g., kink in the catheter or suture constricting the catheter)\n* Previously treated in this study or any tenecteplase catheter clearance trial\n* Use of any investigational drug or therapy within 28 days prior to treatment\n* Use of a fibrinolytic agent (e.g., alteplase, tenecteplase, reteplase, or urokinase) within 24 hours prior to treatment\n* Known to be pregnant or breastfeeding at screening\n* Known bacteremia or known or suspected infection in the CVC catheter\n* Known history of intracranial hemorrhage (within the previous 3 years), intracranial aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation\n* Use of heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) or any other anticoagulants within 24 hours prior to treatment, except heparin used for prophylaxis or intermittent or low-dose, continuous infusion of heparin to maintain catheter or vessel patency\n* Subjects treated with warfarin only: international normalized ratio (INR) ≥ 3.0 within 7 days prior to Visit 1, or a target INR range that allows for an INR ≥ 3.0\n* Initiation of or increase in dose of Plavix® (clopidogrel bisulfate) within 7 days prior to treatment\n* At high risk for bleeding events or embolic complications (i.e., recent pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis, endarterectomy, or clinically significant right-to-left shunt) in the opinion of the investigator, or with known condition for which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard\n* Known hypersensitivity to tenecteplase or any component of the
