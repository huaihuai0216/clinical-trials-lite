If they are entered into the trial due to being sensitive to rifampicin by rapid sputum based test, however on receipt of the rifampicin resistance testing using an indirect susceptibility test in liquid culture this shows they are rifampicin resistant, they will be:\n   * Excluded as late exclusions;\n   * Possibly replaced as determined by the sponsor.\n6. MDR-TB treatment arm subjects should be resistant to rifampicin by rapid sputum based test (may be sensitive or resistant to isoniazid).\n7.

On receipt of the result, if they are resistant, they will be:\n   * Excluded as late exclusions;\n   * Possibly replaced as determined by the sponsor. MDR-TB treatment arm subjects may not be entered prior to receipt of the rapid, sputum - based molecular pyrazinamide resistance screening test result showing they are sensitive to pyrazinamide.\n9.
