First 120 participants will be treated with subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab 600 milligrams (mg) vial (Cohort A) and the subsequent 120 participants will be treated with SC trastuzumab prefilled single use injection device (SID) (Cohort B). Participants from each cohort will receive neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin every 3 weeks (q3w) (1 cycle) for 4 cycles followed by paclitaxel weekly or docetaxel every 3 weeks (q3w) in combination with SC trastuzumab (600 mg) q3w for 4 cycles and a further 14 cycles of SC trastuzumab (600 mg) q3w alone. All participants will be followed up for 24 months after the last participant has received the last dose of study treatment, or earlier in case of withdrawal from the study, loss to follow-up or death.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"Day 1 up to 28 days after last dose of trastuzumab (up to approximately 1 year)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Trastuzumab (Vial): Adjuvant","deltaMin":98.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"Trastuzumab (Vial): Neoadjuvant","deltaMin":100,"sd":null},{"arm":"Trastuzumab (SID): Adjuvant","deltaMin":89.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Trastuzumab (SID): Neoadjuvant","deltaMin":95.2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":54,"countries":["Italy"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30396014"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":95},"commonTop":["Paraesthesia","Arthralgia","Asthenia","Diarrhoea","Erythema"]}}
