Participants will be enrolled in a 28 day TIS run-in phase, and will be eligible for randomization in the comparative phase if they have not received non-study oral antibiotics for a respiratory event, or IV or inhaled antibiotics for any indication between Visits 2 and 3, have not developed a condition requiring hospitalization or other change in clinical status which, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude their ability to continue in the study, and have demonstrated at least 50% TIS compliance. Participants enrolled in the comparative phase will be randomized to receive 3 cycles of treatment, each cycle consisting alternating regimens: AZLI or placebo for 28 days followed by TIS for 28 days.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Rate of Protocol-defined Exacerbations (PDE) From Baseline Through Week 24","timeFrame":"Baseline in the comparative phase to the end of study (average time on study during the Comparative Phase: 155.4 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"AZLI","deltaMin":1.309,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":1.762,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.25"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"6 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":71,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27233377"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":4,"n":107},"commonTop":["Cough","Sputum increased","Dyspnoea","Fatigue","Chest discomfort"]}}
