After surgery, participants will receive a further 10 cycles of SC or IV Herceptin as per randomization to complete 1 year of treatment. All cycles will be 21 days in length. After the end of study treatment, participants will be followed for safety and efficacy for up to 5 years or until disease recurrence, whichever is earlier.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Observed Serum Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Trastuzumab Prior to Surgery","timeFrame":"Pre-dose (0 hours) on Day 1 of Cycle 8 (cycle length of 21 days)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Herceptin IV + Chemotherapy","deltaMin":57.8,"sd":30.3},{"arm":"Herceptin SC + Chemotherapy","deltaMin":78.7,"sd":43.9}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":106,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","Canada","Colombia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Germany","Guatemala","Hong Kong","Hungary","Israel","Italy","Mexico","Panama","Peru","Poland","Russia","Slovakia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Thailand","Turkey (TÃ¼rkiye)"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30998824","22884505"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":45,"n":298},"commonTop":["Alopecia","Nausea","Neutropenia","Diarrhoea","Asthenia"]}}
