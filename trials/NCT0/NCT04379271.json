In this study we plan to investigate if an experimental drug called IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) can improve your symptoms, prevent worsening that would initiate further treatments such as ventilation, and can lower your virus number if given in addition to your doctor's choice of standard therapy. We will also test if IMU-838 has any side effects and measure the level of IMU 838 in your blood.\n\nExperimental drug means that it is not yet authorized for marketing in your country. To date approximately 600 individuals have received IMU-838 (or a drug similar to IMU-838 that contains the same active substance as IMU-838) in research studies.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Proportion of Patients Without Any Need for INV Until EoS","timeFrame":"Throughout the Study (Day 0 to Day 28)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"IMU-838","deltaMin":98,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":101,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":4,"countries":["Bulgaria","Germany"]},"refs":{"pmids":["36242741"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":110},"commonTop":["Hypertriglyceridaemia","Glycosylated haemoglobin increased","Hyperglycaemia","Headache","Bradycardia"]}}
