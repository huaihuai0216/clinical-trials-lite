This was measured by whether the study participant still had OC or sores in his/her mouth after 14 days of treatment. Also, safety and tolerability of GV and nystatin in the treatment of OC were assessed.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Clinical Efficacy","timeFrame":"After 14 days of treatment","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A: Topical GV Solution","deltaMin":76,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B: Nystatin Oral Suspension","deltaMin":73,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":15},"locations":{"siteCount":10,"countries":["Botswana","India","Kenya","Malawi","South Africa","Uganda","Zimbabwe"]},"refs":{"pmids":["27677161"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":18,"n":110},"commonTop":["Blood albumin decreased","Blood calcium decreased","Blood sodium decreased","Haemoglobin decreased","Oral candidiasis"]}}
