Participants with documented angular chelitis and/or erythematous candidiasis without pseudomembranous candidiasis were not eligible to enroll in the study.\n* If on an antiretroviral therapy (ART), initiation of regimen at least 12 weeks prior to study entry, and willingness of participant to remain on current ART regimen until the study-defined 14-day treatment period was complete. NOTE: Participants who were not ART-na√Øve and not on ART were eligible to participate in the study if they did not intend to initiate ART during the study- defined 14-day treatment period.\n* CD4+ cell count obtained within 30 days prior to study entry at a DAIDS-approved laboratory.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Documented or presumptive signs or symptoms of esophageal candidiasis (e.g., dysphagia) during the screening period unless endoscopic examination of the esophagus was performed, and fungal esophagitis were excluded.\n* Use of any investigational drug currently or within 30 days prior to study entry. NOTE: For purposes of this study, drugs available under an FDA-authorized expanded access program was NOT considered investigational.\n* Concurrent vaginal candidiasis within 21 days prior to study entry.\n* Use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids within 14 days prior to study entry.\n* Use of any antifungal agents within 30 days prior to study entry.\n* Anticipated need for systemic or oral/topical antifungal agents for other diagnoses within the study-defined 14-day treatment period.\n* Intend to initiate ART during the screening period, at study entry, or within the study-defined 14-day treatment period.\n* Intend to use any additional oral topical treatments within the study- defined 14-day treatment period.\n* Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or their formulation.\n* Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.\n* Serious illness, in the opinion of the site investigator, requiring systemic treatment.\n* Hospitalization within 30 days prior to study entry for HIV or HIV-related conditions.\n* Previous or current history of porphyria.\n* Presence of oral warts during the screening period or at the study entry visit before randomization.\n* Current wearing of full dentures or a maxillary partial denture at study entry","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants With Clinical Efficacy","description":"The primary endpoint is clinical efficacy defined as cure (absence of lesions) or improvement (a decrease in severity of lesions) after 14 days of treatment. The oral cavity will be split arbitrarily into 6 sites: left lower and upper labial mucosa and buccal mucosa, right lower and upper labial mucosa and buccal mucosa, hard palate, soft palate, tongue (dorsum, lateral, and ventral), and floor of mouth. Severity is scored using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0 corresponds to absence of lesions, and 3 corresponds to presence of extensive confluent lesions) which leads to a composite severity score ranging from 0 to 18 after adding up the scores from all 6 sites. Complete success is assigned if the composite score after treatment equals to 0. Improved/partial response is assigned if the composite score after treatment is less than the baseline score. The blinded evaluator scores the severity of lesions by examining different lesion characteristics.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"76","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"73","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participant With Symptom","description":"Symptoms were assessed using a visual analog scale where the level of discomfort and pain were recorded and quantified using a scoring system from 0 to 3. 0=no discomfort/pain; 1=mild discomfort/pain; 2=Moderate discomfort/pain; 3=Severe discomfort/pain.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"106","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"111","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"102","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"102","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"106","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"111","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"102","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"102","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Quantitative Yeast Colony Counts","description":"If quantitative yeast culture yielding \\< 20 CFU/mL of Candida spp., then we call this mycological success","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7.2497","spread":"2.2382"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"7.0037","spread":"2.0584"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.9374","spread":"2.1438"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"5.8888","spread":"2.3970"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6.7388","spread":"2.3469"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6.5929","spread":"2.3668"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Tolerance","description":"The investigators will measure tolerance using a scale from 0 to 3 (0=No side effects experienced, no changes in treatment; 1=Some side effects experienced, but not enough to modify treatment; 2=Some side effects experienced, resulted in treatment interruption; 3=Side effects experienced, resulted in treatment discontinuation.)","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"100","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"98","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"3","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Were Adherent.","description":"Adherence was reported as a dichotomous variable (adherence vs. non-adherence).
