All patients will receive a behavioral intervention, termed Medical Management/Medication Coaching or MM/MC. MM/MC incorporates the behavioral platform Medical Management (MM) from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)-funded COMBINE Study to reduce heavy alcohol use with Medication Coaching (MC), a manualized treatment designed to improve HAART medication adherence in HIV-infected patients with substance use disorders.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"HAART Adherence","timeFrame":"One year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Placebo + MM/MC","deltaMin":7,"sd":null},{"arm":"NTX + MM/MC","deltaMin":4,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["30073637"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":3,"n":26},"commonTop":["Fall Related Injury"]}}
