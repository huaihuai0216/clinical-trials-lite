If it is found to be safe, it will pave the way for use in routine vaccination programs. The hypothesis is that children who receive JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine and measles vaccine at the same time are protected against these diseases at the same level as those who receive the vaccines at different intervals.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants With Seroprotection for Measles 4 Weeks After Vaccination","timeFrame":"Day 0 (before vaccination) and Day 28 (4 weeks after measles vaccination)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LJEV Then MV","deltaMin":1.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"LJEV and MV","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"MV Then LJEV","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"8 Months","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":19},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["Philippines"]},"refs":{"pmids":["18394765"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":100},"commonTop":["Upper respiratory tract infection","Acute gastroenteritis","Acute rhinitis","Acute bronchitis","Systemic viral infection"]}}
