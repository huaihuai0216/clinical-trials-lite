A total of three questions are asked: 1) \"How often do you snore, 2) \"How long do you snore\", and 3) How audible is your snoring. Answers for each of these questions are summed for a total SSS score. A score of '0' would indicate no snoring at all, while a score of '9' would indicate the most severe snoring as measured by the SSS.\n\nOutcome measure reported as change with use of the device over pre-trial. In this case, a negative ('-') would represent improvement in snoring symptoms, while a positive ('+') number would indicate an increase in snoring severity.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-4.1","spread":"0.082"}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Visual-Analogue Scale, Self-Reported Snoring Habits","description":"Quantitative assessment on 1-10 scale.
