It includes questions on both physical and mental health. Higher scores indicate a better QOL. The VEINES-QOL is a venous-disease specific QOL measure that consists of 25 items that quantify venous disease effect on QOL, and an embedded symptom sub-questionnaire (VEINES-Sym) with 10 items that measures venous symptoms. Higher scores are associated with better QOL.\n\nThe VEINES-QOL/Sym and SF-36 use the standard method for scoring questionnaires with items with different response scales that is now routinely used. Raw scores are first transformed to z score equivalents (mean, 0; standard deviation, 1), which then are transformed to T scores (mean, 50; standard deviation, 10) to give an easily understood range of scores. A person-specific estimate is imputed for any missing item in cases where the patient answered at least 50% of the items in the scale.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"46.7","spread":"10.7"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"47.5","spread":"10.2"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"52.7","spread":"9.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"52.5","spread":"8.8"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"56.6","spread":"5.3"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"57.4","spread":"5.3"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":409},"commonTop":["Rash/Itching"]}}}
