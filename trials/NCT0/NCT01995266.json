Positive anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA or positive HCV genotype test at least 6 months prior to screening\n\n     or\n  2. Liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection (evidence of fibrosis and/or inflammation)\n* Subjects who are intolerant to previous therapy with Interferon Alfa (IFNα) either with or without Ribavirin (RBV) (I±R)(independent of previous response to therapy) or ineligible for I±R and who meet one of the criteria below:\n\n  1. Anemia: the I±R intolerants are subjects who were previously treated with IFNα/RBV therapy and had a decline in hemoglobin to \\< 8.5 g/dL during therapy (documented); the I±R ineligibles are subjects who have a screening hemoglobin \\< 10.0 g/dL and ≥ 8.5 g/dL\n\n     OR\n  2. Neutropenia: the I±R intolerants are subjects who were previously treated with IFNα/RBV therapy and had a decline in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to \\< 0.5 x 10(9) during therapy (documented); the I±R ineligibles are subjects who have a screening ANC \\< 1.5 x 10(9) cells/L and ≥ 0.5 x 10(9) cells/L\n\n     OR\n  3. Thrombocytopenia: the I±R intolerants are subjects who were previously treated with IFNα/RBV therapy and had a decline in platelet counts \\< 25,000 cells/mm3 during therapy (documented); the I±R ineligibles are subjects who have a screening platelet count of \\< 90 x 10(9) cells/L and ≥ 50 x 10(9) cells/L\n* HCV RNA ≥ 10,000 IU/mL\n* Seronegative for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)\n* Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18 to 35 kg/m2, inclusive. BMI = weight (kg)/ \\[height(m)\\]2 at screening\n* Subjects with compensated cirrhosis are permitted (compensated cirrhotics are capped at approximately 40%). If a subject does not have cirrhosis, a liver biopsy within three years prior to enrollment is required to demonstrate the absence of cirrhosis. If cirrhosis is present, any prior liver biopsy is sufficient. For countries where liver biopsy is not required prior to treatment and where noninvasive imaging tests (Fibroscan® ultrasound) are approved for staging of liver disease, non-invasive imaging test results may be used to assess the extent of liver disease\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Prior treatment with HCV direct acting antiviral (DAA)\n* Evidence of a medical condition contributing to chronic liver disease other than HCV\n* Evidence of decompensated liver disease including, but not limited to, a history or presence of ascites, bleeding varices, or hepatic encephalopathy\n* Diagnosed or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma or other malignancies\n* Uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension\n* History of moderate to severe depression. Well-controlled mild depression is allowed\n* Total bilirubin ≥ 34 µmol/L (or ≥ 2 mg/dL) unless subject has a documented history of Gilbert's disease\n* Confirmed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Confirmed albumin \\< 3.5 g/dL (35 g/L)\n* Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) \\> 100 ng/mL OR ≥ 50 and ≤ 100 ng/mL requires a liver ultrasound and subjects with findings suspicious of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are excluded\n* Confirmed hemoglobin \\< 8.5 g/dL\n* Confirmed ANC \\< 0.5 x 10(9) cells/L\n* Confirmed platelet count \\< 50,000 cells/mm3","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) at Post-Treatment Follow-up Week 24 (SVR24)","description":"SVR was defined as Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) \\< lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) target detected (TD) or not detected (TND) at post-treatment follow-up Week 24.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"91.2","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) at Post-Treatment Follow-up Week 12 (SVR12)","description":"SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA \\< LLOQ target detected or not detected at post-treatment follow-up Week 12.
