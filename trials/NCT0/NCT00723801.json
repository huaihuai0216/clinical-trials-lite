With the patient lying supine in a quiet environment, a handheld micromanometer-tipped probe was applied to the skin surface over the carotid and femoral arteries, compressing the vessel wall so that transmural forces within the vessel wall were perpendicular to the arterial surface. The distance from the sternal notch to the sites of carotid and femoral pulse acquisition were measured and inputted into the device to represent the relative distance from the carotid to femoral artery. The calculation of distance divided by time of pulse upstroke relative to the upstroke of the QRS on a 3 lead surface EKG was used by the device to calculate velocity. All recorded measurements met the manufacturer's quality control standards integrated into the software package.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-1.15","spread":"1.68"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.22","spread":".59"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Diastolic Function - Ejection Fraction","description":"Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed using a 3.0 MHz transducer (General Electric VIVID 7).
