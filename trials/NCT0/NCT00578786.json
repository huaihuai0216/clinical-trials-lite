In addition, this study continued the efficacy assessments of the previous studies, examined long-term AMB treatment success, and compared long-term survival of subjects treated with AMB to the NIH registry of patients with PAH.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Frequently Reported (15% or More Overall) Adverse Events by Severity","timeFrame":"Baseline to Week 295","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ambrisentan 2.5 mg","deltaMin":1,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ambrisentan 5 mg","deltaMin":20,"sd":null},{"arm":"Ambrisentan 10 mg","deltaMin":36,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":1},"locations":{"siteCount":22,"countries":["Argentina","Brazil","Chile","Mexico"]},"refs":{"pmids":["19909879"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":26,"n":43},"commonTop":["Oedema peripheal","Headache","Cough","Upper respiratory tract infection","Dizziness"]}}
