The scores range from 0 (minimum, best possible health status) to 100 (maximum, worst possible health status). The SGRQ contains 76 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, activity and impacts). Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the SGRQ total score at that visit minus Baseline.
