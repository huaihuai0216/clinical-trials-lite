Two different mipomersen dosing regimens will be studied: subcutaneous (SC) mipomersen 200 mg once weekly versus placebo, and SC mipomersen 70 mg thrice weekly versus placebo.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* Determine whether there are qualitative differences between the safety profiles of the 2 dosing regimens and placebo in Cohort 1, patients with HeFH with LDL-C levels ≥160 mg/dL and \\<200 mg/dL plus the presence of CHD/risk equivalents (referred to as Cohort 2), and the overall study population\n* Determine whether there are qualitative differences between the tolerability of the 2 dosing regimens and placebo in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and the overall study population\n* Further characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the 2 dosing regimens in Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and the overall study population\n* Determine whether the 2 mipomersen dosing regimens significantly reduce atherogenic lipid levels in Cohort 2 compared to placebo\n* Obtain additional data regarding ongoing safety and efficacy of mipomersen in patients with FH and inadequately controlled LDL-C who complete the primary efficacy assessment visit (PET) in the Blinded Treatment Period and continue treatment in Open-Label Continuation Period","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline To Primary Endpoint Visit (PET) In LDL-C In Cohort 1","timeFrame":"Baseline and Week 61","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Regimen A: Mipomersen, 200 mg, Once Weekly","deltaMin":-27.17,"sd":5.653},{"arm":"Regimen A: Placebo, Once Weekly","deltaMin":-6.77,"sd":6.749},{"arm":"Regimen B: Mipomersen, 70 mg, Thrice Weekly","deltaMin":-22.96,"sd":5.362},{"arm":"Regimen B: Placebo, Thrice Weekly","deltaMin":-10.62,"sd":5.765}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":2},"locations":{"siteCount":113,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Croatia","Czechia","Denmark","Germany","Greece","Hong Kong","Hungary","India","Israel","Italy","Malaysia","Netherlands","New Zealand","Norway","Poland","Russia","South Africa","South Korea","Spain","Sweden","Taiwan","Turkey (Türkiye)","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26946290"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":17,"n":104},"commonTop":["Influenza like illness","Alanine aminotransferase increased","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Nasopharyngitis","Injection site erythema"]}}
