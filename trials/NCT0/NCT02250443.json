This study is designed to confirm the efficacy, safety and tolerability of BYM338 in sIBM with long-term dosing. However due to lack of efficacy in patients with sIBM, the study was terminated early.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability","timeFrame":"Up to 29 month","effectByArm":[{"arm":"BYM338","deltaMin":0,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"40 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32690797"],"seeAlso":["https://www.novctrd.com/ctrdweb/patientsummary/patientsummaries?patientSummaryId=184"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":2,"n":10},"commonTop":["Fall","Muscle spasms","Diarrhoea","Skin abrasion","Acne"]}}
