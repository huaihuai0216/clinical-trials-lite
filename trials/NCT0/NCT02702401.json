The primary hypotheses of this study are: 1) pembrolizumab plus BSC prolongs PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review compared to placebo plus BSC, and 2) pembrolizumab plus BSC improves OS compared with placebo plus BSC.\n\nEffective with Amendment 4: Upon study completion, participants are discontinued and may be enrolled in a pembrolizumab extension study, if available.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)","timeFrame":"Through database cutoff date of 26-Mar-2018 (Up to approximately 21 months)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Pembrolizumab + Best Supportive Care","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo + Best Supportive Care","deltaMin":2.8,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0186"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":11,"exclusionCount":25},"locations":{"siteCount":0,"countries":[]},"refs":{"pmids":["31790344","40486134","34616489"],"seeAlso":["http://merckoncologyclinicaltrials.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":106,"n":279},"commonTop":["Fatigue","Aspartate aminotransferase increased","Pruritus","Diarrhoea","Decreased appetite"]}}
