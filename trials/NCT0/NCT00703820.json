In addition, we will investigate the efficacy of clofarabine + cytarabine (Clo/AraC) in newly diagnosed patients with AML and attempt to optimize outcome through the use of MRD-adapted therapy and further improvements in supportive care.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Day 22 Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Measured by Flow Cytometry","timeFrame":"Day 22 MRD measurement after one course of therapy","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Cytarabine+Daunorubicin+Etoposide","deltaMin":42,"sd":null},{"arm":"Clofarabine+Cytarabine","deltaMin":57,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.035"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":12},"locations":{"siteCount":8,"countries":["United States","Singapore"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31246522","30894213"],"seeAlso":["http://www.stjude.org","http://www.stjude.org/protocols"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":127,"n":133},"commonTop":["Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever)"]}}
