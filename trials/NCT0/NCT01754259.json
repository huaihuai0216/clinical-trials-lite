Diabetic patients without known CAD with impaired coronary vascular function show a risk of cardiac death comparable to, and possibly higher, than that for non-diabetic patients with known CAD10. In the setting of increased oxygen demand, coronary vasodilator dysfunction can upset the supply-demand relationship and lead to myocardial ischemia, subclinical left ventricular dysfunction (diastolic and systolic), and symptoms.\n\nThe significance of microvascular coronary dysfunction is increasingly recognized as invasive and non-invasive (PET) methods of quantifying CFR become available.\n\nImportantly, current treatment strategies for obstructive CAD, such as percutaneous coronary intervention with angioplasty and stenting, are not helpful in microvascular disease. Similarly, mortality-altering treatments for systolic heart failure, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, have not been beneficial in treating diastolic dysfunction.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Change in Post-exercise Coronary Vasodilator Reserve","timeFrame":"4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Ranolazine","deltaMin":-4,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":2,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["28473401"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":23},"commonTop":["Nausea and Dizziness","Hypoglycemia","Renal abnormality","Transaminitis","Hematuria"]}}
