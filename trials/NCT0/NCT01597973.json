Analysis will include subjects with bloodstream infection (BSI) or pneumonia due to at least one of the following gram-negative bacilli organisms: Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp. and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa that demonstrates in vitro non-susceptibility defined as extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (XDR-GNB) which includes XDR-AB, XDR-PA and CRE. If a subject has both BSI and pneumonia at the time of study enrollment, they will be included as a subject with pneumonia.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary:\n\n•Determine whether the treatment regimen of Colistimethate sodium (colistin) combined with a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) is associated with a decreased risk for mortality compared to colistin alone for subjects with bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or pneumonia due to XDR-GNB.\n\nSecondary:\n\n•Determine what treatment regimen (colistin monotherapy or colistin combined with a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) is more likely to reduce the emergence of colistin resistance among XDR-GNB isolates during therapy.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mortality","timeFrame":"participants will be followed daily for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Colistin and Placebo","deltaMin":92,"sd":null},{"arm":"Colistin and a Carbapenem","deltaMin":78,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.21"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":10},"locations":{"siteCount":19,"countries":["United States","Bulgaria","Greece","Israel","Italy","Taiwan","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":["37538951"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":230},"commonTop":["Acute kidney injury","Creatinine increased","Sepsis","Aspartate aminotransferase increase","Blood bilirubin increased"]}}
