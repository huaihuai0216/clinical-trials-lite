Currently available dementia medications do not alter the disease course. Therefore, it is critically important to identify effective strategies for helping older Veterans living with dementia to enhance their functional status and quality of life. The investigators have developed a novel, integrative group movement program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE) that incorporates elements from Eastern and Western exercise modalities and is designed to build and maintain the capacity to perform basic functional movements while increasing mindful body awareness and enhancing social connection. Pilot study results suggested that PLIE is associated with meaningful improvements in physical function, cognitive function and quality of life as well as reduced caregiver burden. The goal of the current study is to perform a full-scale randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of PLIE in older Veterans with dementia.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD)","timeFrame":"4 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Immediate Start","deltaMin":38.8,"sd":6.2},{"arm":"Delayed Start","deltaMin":40,"sd":4.3}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.14"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.03"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":null,"sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":4,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["25671576","25022459"],"seeAlso":["https://www.facebook.com/plie4dementia","http://www.osher.ucsf.edu/research/current-research/preventing-loss-of-independence-through-exercise-plie/","http://www.sanfrancisco.va.gov/research/study.asp"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":8,"n":44},"commonTop":["Not serious","Other AE","Procedures"]}}
