We will decrease DA activity in the kidney by inhibiting DA synthesis via carbidopa administration. We want to compare findings in normal volunteers and in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We will test the null hypothesis (Ho) that the effects of oral carbidopa administration on urinary sodium excretion will not differ between patients with POTS and healthy volunteers.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"24 Hour Urinary Sodium Excretion During Treatment Normalized to Creatinine","timeFrame":"Immediately before the 1st dose of placebo or carbidopa to immediately before the 5th dose (approximately 24 hours)","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Healthy Participants Who Received Placebo as Treatment A or Treatment B","deltaMin":140,"sd":29},{"arm":"Healthy Participants Who Received Carbidopa as Treatment A or Treatment B","deltaMin":132,"sd":38},{"arm":"Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Participants Who Received Placebo as Treatment A or Treatment B","deltaMin":137,"sd":30},{"arm":"Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Patients Who Received Carbidopa as Treatment A or Treatment B","deltaMin":154,"sd":31}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":5,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["11566894","2498027","10981146","710137","9222944","9274896"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":17},"commonTop":["Head rush","Lightheadedness","Vertigo","Nausea"]}}
