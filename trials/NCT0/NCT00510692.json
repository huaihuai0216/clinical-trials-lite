Sexually active males must agree to use an accepted method of contraception.\n* Rectal polyp status: the subject has an endoscopically assessable rectal segment.\n* Subjects must show a willingness to abstain from regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication for the duration of the study. A cardioprotective dose of aspirin (75mg) will be permitted.\n* Subjects must have provided written informed consent to participate.\n* Subjects must have assessable rectal polyps post baseline flexible sigmoidoscopy.\n* Subjects must have the following rectal polyp burden at the conclusion of the baseline endoscopy:\n* Rectum - 3 or more quantifiable polyps â‰¥2mm diameter\n* In the rectum quantifiable polyps are defined as being within a composite \"cloverleaf\" photograph that includes a tattoo.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Subjects who are due to undergo an anticipated colectomy within 8 months of randomisation\n* History of invasive carcinoma in the past 5 years other than resected Dukes' A/B1 colon cancer or resected non-melanomatous skin cancer\n* Partial or complete colectomy within 12 months prior to enrolment.\n* History of pelvic radiation\n* Subjects who are allergic to fish\n* Subjects who have diabetes mellitus\n* Subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding\n* Subjects taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on a regular basis other than low dose (75 mg) cardioprotective dose.\n* Subjects who have aspirin-sensitive asthma\n* Subjects suffering from haemorrhagic disorders\n* Subjects who are taking warfarin or other anticoagulants\n* Subjects who have significant abnormalities on their screening blood tests\n* Subjects taking lipid lowering medication\n* Subjects with gastrointestinal malabsorptive disease\n* Subjects with known or prior coagulopathy\n* Subjects with uncontrolled hypercholesterolaemia\n* Subjects who are taking other fish-oil supplements (e.g. cod liver oil) who are unwilling to stop them for the duration of the study. Subjects previously taking fish oil must have a washout period of 1 month prior to study enrolment.\n* Subjects who are deemed mentally incompetent, or have a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia\n* Subjects with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, including laxative abuse which would render the subject unreliable.\n* Subjects considered by their physician unlikely to be able to comply with the protocol.\n* Subjects who have taken part in an experimental drug study in the preceding 3 months.\n* Subjects who have a positive pregnancy test within 14 days prior to baseline visit.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Absolute Change in the Number of Polyps Measured in a Focal Area of the Rectum.","description":"Absolute change in the number of polyps measured in a defined focal area of the rectum.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.5","spread":"0.9"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.5","spread":"1.4"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Percentage Change in the Number of Polyps Measured in the Defined Focal Area of the Rectum.","description":"Percentage change in the number of polyps measured in the defined focal area of the rectum in subjects treated with EPA compared to subjects receiving placebo.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-12.6","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9.7","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change in Global Rectal Polyp Burden.","description":"Change in global rectal polyp burden in subjects treated with Eicosapentanoic Acid (EPA) compared to subjects receiving placebo.
