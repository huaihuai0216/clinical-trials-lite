Subjects in the LCS12 arm will be offered continued use of LCS12 for the full, intended duration of use (up to 3 years) by continuing in a optional, extension phase. Safety data only will be collected during the extension phase of the study.\n\nSecondary objectives are to observe the tolerability, discontinuation rates, adverse event profiles, occurrences of unintended pregnancies (including calculation of Pearl Index \\[PI\\]), and bleeding profiles with the two birth-control methods. Additionally, data on missed tablets in the combined oral contraceptive (COC) group, and intrauterine delivery system (IUS) expulsions in the LCS12 group will be recorded. In the LCS12 group, physician satisfaction with the IUS inserter, evaluation of the visibility and texture of the removal threads, and evaluation of the visibility of the LCS12 on ultrasound (in a subset of subjects) will be collected. Finally, in the COC group, information will be collected on the psychosocial impact of missed or delayed pill intake.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Satisfaction Rate at 18 Months (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF)","timeFrame":"At 18 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"LCS12 (Skyla, BAY86-5028)","deltaMin":82.1,"sd":null},{"arm":"EE30/DRSP (Yasmin, BAY86-5131)","deltaMin":81.9,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":6,"exclusionCount":8},"locations":{"siteCount":94,"countries":["United States","Austria","Belgium","Germany","Russia"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["http://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":22,"n":279},"commonTop":["Dysmenorrhoea","Dysmenorrhoea","Headache","Headache","Cervical dysplasia"]}}
