The secondary objectives of this study are to determine whether peginterferon beta-1a, at 1 year when compared with placebo, is effective in reducing the total number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, reducing the proportion of participants who relapse, and slowing the progression of disability.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) at 1 Year","timeFrame":"1 Year","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Year 1: Placebo","deltaMin":0.397,"sd":null},{"arm":"Year 1: Peginterferon Beta-1a Q4W","deltaMin":0.288,"sd":null},{"arm":"Year 1: Peginterferon Beta-1a Q2W","deltaMin":0.256,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.0114"},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"0.0007"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":3},"locations":{"siteCount":178,"countries":["United States","Belgium","Bulgaria","Canada","Chile","Colombia","Croatia","Czechia","Estonia","France","Georgia","Germany","Greece","India","Latvia","Mexico","Netherlands","New Zealand","Peru","Poland","Romania","Russia","Serbia","Spain","Ukraine","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["24794721","37652990","33307998","29104758","28607743","28450894","28183276","26195056","25551571","25432952","25265472"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":76,"n":499},"commonTop":["Injection Site Erythema","Influenza Like Illness","Headache","Pyrexia","Multiple Sclerosis Relapse"]}}
