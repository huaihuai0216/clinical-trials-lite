The BDI will be measured after 9 months of growth hormone treatment and 3 months without treatment (total 12 months) in PASC subjects only.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG002","value":"10.7","spread":"8.1"}]}]}]},{"type":"OTHER_PRE_SPECIFIED","title":"Walking Distance at 25% Perceptual Effort as Measured by Walking Test at Baseline","description":"Walking performance will be assessed in mTBI and PASC patients during 6 minutes of walking in long corridor hallways.
