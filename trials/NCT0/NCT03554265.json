Testing of cognition, exercise, fatigue, brain activation and morphology, body composition and measurements of quality of life will be performed before and after the treatment period. Fecal sampling for characterization of the GI microbiome will occur monthly over the treatment period. Control subjects will be enrolled and will provide fecal samples monthly for 6 months. GI microbiomes will be compared between mTBI patients, PASC patients and controls at baseline as well as over the treatment period.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Lean Body Mass as Measured by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) at Baseline","timeFrame":"baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"mTBI Subjects","deltaMin":49.9,"sd":11.8},{"arm":"PASC Subjects","deltaMin":49.6,"sd":13.2}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38894576"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":28},"commonTop":["Joint pain","Muscle soreness","Injection site reactions","Tingling, numbness or prickling","Swelling"]}}
