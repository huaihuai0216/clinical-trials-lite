The study drug was instilled approximately 15 minutes after conducting the 9AM IOP measurement. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye, and only data for the study eye were used for the efficacy analysis. A higher IOP can be a greater risk factor for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage).","paramType":"LEAST_SQUARES_MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Error","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-7.9","spread":"0.22"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-6.5","spread":"0.23"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-6.4","spread":"0.24"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":193},"commonTop":["Ocular hyperaemia","Dry Mouth","Dysgeusia","Conjunctivitis","Vision Blurred"]}}}
