The study will evaluate avatrombopag in the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with liver disease prior to an elective procedure to reduce the need for platelet transfusions or any rescue procedure for bleeding due to procedural and post-procedural bleeding complications. Participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts according to mean baseline platelet count and, within each baseline platelet count cohort will be further stratified by risk of bleeding associated with the elective procedure (low, moderate, or high) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) status (Yes or No).","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Who Did Not Require a Platelet Transfusion or Any Rescue Procedure for Bleeding After Randomization Following a Scheduled Procedure","timeFrame":"Baseline (Visit 2) up to 7 days following a scheduled procedure","effectByArm":[{"arm":"60 mg Placebo (Lower Baseline Platelet Count)","deltaMin":22.9,"sd":null},{"arm":"60 mg Avatrombopag, (Lower Baseline Platelet Count)","deltaMin":65.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"40 mg Placebo (Higher Baseline Platelet Count)","deltaMin":38.2,"sd":null},{"arm":"40 mg Avatrombopag (Higher Baseline Platelet Count)","deltaMin":88.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"<0.0001"},{"comp":"OG002 vs OG003","p":"<0.0001"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":109,"countries":["United States","Argentina","Australia","Austria","Belgium","Brazil","Canada","Chile","China","France","Germany","Hungary","Italy","Poland","Portugal","South Korea","Spain","Taiwan","Thailand","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["32047671","29778606"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":11,"n":48},"commonTop":["Abdominal pain","Pyrexia","Headache","Nausea","Fatigue"]}}
