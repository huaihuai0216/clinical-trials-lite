The blinded phase only will be described in this record. Participants will receive 1 of 2 doses of GWP42003-P or matching placebo. The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will be a difference between GWP42003-P and placebo in their effect on seizure frequency.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Percent Change From Baseline in the Number of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)-Associated Seizures During the Treatment Period (Maintenance and Titration)","timeFrame":"Baseline; up to Week 16","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GWP42003-P 25 mg/kg/Day","deltaMin":-43.36,"sd":null},{"arm":"GWP42003-P 50 mg/kg/Day","deltaMin":-36.55,"sd":null},{"arm":"Placebo","deltaMin":-20.08,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000","p":null},{"comp":"OG001","p":null},{"comp":"OG002","p":null},{"comp":"OG000 vs OG002","p":"=0.0009"},{"comp":"OG001 vs OG002","p":"=0.0018"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"1 Year","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":3,"exclusionCount":14},"locations":{"siteCount":44,"countries":["United States","Australia","Netherlands","Poland","Spain","United Kingdom"]},"refs":{"pmids":["38441854","35175622","34957550","33346789"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":16,"n":75},"commonTop":["Diarrhoea","Decreased appetite","Somnolence","Nasopharyngitis","Vomiting"]}}
