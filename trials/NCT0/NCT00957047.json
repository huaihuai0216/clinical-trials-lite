The primary efficacy variable is the ln transformation of the seizure frequency per 4 weeks. Seizure frequency was compared between each active treatment group and the placebo group using an ANCOVA that models seizure frequency as a function of baseline seizure frequency and treatment.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"8.7","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"7.1","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"9.8","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"PART II - NÂº of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)","description":"Safety assessments were based primarily on AEs (Number of patients who experienced at least one AEs), and on whether these were related to the study medication, were serious, led to permanent discontinuation of study participation, or led to death.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"270","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"151","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"240","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG003","value":"194","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG004","value":"37","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG005","value":"28","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG006","value":"3","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":100},"commonTop":["Dizziness","Somnolence","Headache","Diplopia","Coordination abnormal"]}}}
