In the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP) booster phase, subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix-HepB/Hiberix (active control) at 15 to 18 or 24 months in a single-blind manner so that the subjects' parents will not know which vaccine was administered to their child. In the Mencevax ACWY phase at 24-30 months, a dose of Mencevax ACWY will be given in an open manner to only those subjects who received less than 4 doses of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC. No blood samples will be taken in this safety study.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Subjects With Fever >39Â°C (Rectal Route).","timeFrame":"During the 4-day (Day 0-3) follow-up period after booster vaccination","effectByArm":[{"arm":"ACAC_Thailand Group","deltaMin":22,"sd":null},{"arm":"ACHibPS_Thailand Group","deltaMin":8,"sd":null},{"arm":"HibACPS_Thailand Group","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"HibHibPS_Thailand Group","deltaMin":3,"sd":null},{"arm":"ACAC_Philippines Group","deltaMin":40,"sd":null},{"arm":"ACHibPS_Philippines Group","deltaMin":24,"sd":null},{"arm":"HibACPS_Philippines Group","deltaMin":17,"sd":null},{"arm":"HibHibPS_Philippines Group","deltaMin":6,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"427 Days","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":true,"inclusionCount":1,"exclusionCount":4},"locations":{"siteCount":2,"countries":["Philippines","Thailand"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":["https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":5,"n":398},"commonTop":["Pain","Pyrexia","Irritability","Somnolence","Decreased appetite"]}}
