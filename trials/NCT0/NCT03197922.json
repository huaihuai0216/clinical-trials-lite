An incontinent day is a day with an incontinent bowel movement regardless of whether a continent bowel movement also occurs).\n* Medication free or on stable medication (no changes in past 6 weeks and no planned changes for the next 6 months).\n* Urine continent - Over half of the voids are continent when the child is with the parent and when the child is on a typical toileting routine.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Presence of a known medical condition in the child (based on medical history or physical examination) that would interfere with child's ability to control his/her anus. These include: history of any anal surgery, spinal dysraphism (e.g., spina bifida), other neurologic disorder affecting anal function, and prolonged/recurrent gastrointestinal infectious disease (e.g. Clostridium difficile colitis). In addition, the following may constitute exclusions following evaluation by a physician: inflammatory bowel disease, short gut syndrome, chronic diarrhea, or history of intestinal/abdominal surgery.\n* Presence of a current serious behavioral problem or psychiatric condition that would require another treatment (e.g., psychotic disorder, major depression, moderate or greater aggression, severe disruptive behavior), based on information collected at screening and the Behavior Problems Inventory-01 (BPI-01).\n* Currently receiving and caregiver refusal to discontinue ongoing behavioral or alternative medical intervention for encopresis.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"5 Years","maximumAge":"12 Years","stdAges":["CHILD"]},"locations":{"multicenter":false},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Percentage of Continent Bowel Movements","description":"The percentage to continent bowel movements, based on parent report during the prior 7 day period, are reported for Baseline and the end of treatment at Week 8.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"27.33","spread":"29.72"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"16.99","spread":"28.48"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"20.70","spread":"25.80"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"55.50","spread":"33.18"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"79.69","spread":"29.51"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"37.74","spread":"35.92"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Number of Children Responding to Treatment as Rated by the Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) Score","description":"The Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) is a single item asking clinicians to indicate the degree of improvement following treatment on a 7-point scale.
