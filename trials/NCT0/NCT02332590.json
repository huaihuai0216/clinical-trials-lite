Entire TEAE period: last OLE dose - first DB dose date + 6 weeks (follow-up), regardless of unplanned intermittent discontinuations.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"11","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"DB Period: Pharmacokinetics: Serum Trough (Pre-dose) Concentrations of Functional Sarilumab","description":"Data for this outcome measure was not planned to be collected and analyzed for \"Adalimumab 40 mg/Sarilumab 200 mg\" arm.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.00","spread":"0.00"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5566.03","spread":"4843.57"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"11209.64","spread":"8202.70"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21355.19","spread":"14805.63"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23143.39","spread":"16508.71"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"25252.43","spread":"17319.04"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"24233.10","spread":"17581.72"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"OLE Period: Pharmacokinetics: Serum Trough (Pre-dose) Concentrations of Functional Sarilumab","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"109.38","spread":"1237.44"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24403.72","spread":"17588.31"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18952.69","spread":"15125.86"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"26006.07","spread":"19194.79"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21911.87","spread":"17926.01"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"25571.16","spread":"18958.00"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"21583.82","spread":"17594.87"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"24005.78","spread":"18541.46"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23230.92","spread":"18274.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"23873.23","spread":"19794.57"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20405.02","spread":"15553.02"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21023.55","spread":"17792.89"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"20814.89","spread":"17848.70"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"20021.53","spread":"18580.91"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"23604.11","spread":"19660.31"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"22423.29","spread":"18757.11"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"18611.01","spread":"16417.46"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"21856.85","spread":"18612.43"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"17982.66","spread":"16640.61"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18244.96","spread":"16383.47"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19451.40","spread":"17694.09"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"18315.19","spread":"17525.62"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19663.10","spread":"16020.11"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"19224.47","spread":"16964.41"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"19071.00","spread":"18425.13"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"17014.75","spread":"16207.18"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"9260.00","spread":"8683.27"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1237.01","spread":"2856.88"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"2280.98","spread":"7909.71"}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":13,"n":184},"commonTop":["Nasopharyngitis","Neutropenia","Bronchitis","Accidental overdose","Injection site erythema"]}}}
