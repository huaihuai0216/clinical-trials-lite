Lower ratings indicate better sleep quality and more refreshing/restorative quality of sleep.","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.4","spread":"0.07"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.5","spread":"0.07"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.7","spread":"0.07"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"-0.5","spread":"0.08"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"-0.3","spread":"0.09"},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"-0.5","spread":"0.09"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Change From Baseline in Core Consensus Sleep Diary Parameter: Number of Participants With Subjective Sleep Quality (sSQ) Response","description":"The Core Consensus Sleep Diary collected subjective sleep parameters, including sleep quality (sSQ).

It covers eight health dimensions including four physical health status domains (physical functioning, role participation with physical health problems, bodily pain, and general health) and four mental health status domains (vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional health problems, and mental health). Two summary scores, physical component summary (PCS), and mental component summary (MCS) were produced by taking a weighted linear combination of the eight individual domains. The score range for PCS and MCS is 0 to 100 (100=highest level of functioning). Higher scores indicate a better state of health.
