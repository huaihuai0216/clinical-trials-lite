Venous thromboembolism is a condition in which a blood clot forms in a vein and then breaks off and moves through the bloodstream. Patients with cancer are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Apixaban and dalteparin are drugs used to prevent blood clots from forming or to treat blood clots that have formed. It is not yet known whether apixaban or dalteparin is more effective in reducing blood clots in patients with cancer related venous thromboembolism.\n\nADAM-VTE","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"6 Month Bleeding Rate","timeFrame":"Up to 6 months","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Arm A (Apixaban)","deltaMin":0,"sd":null},{"arm":"Arm B (Dalteparin)","deltaMin":2.1,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":12,"exclusionCount":17},"locations":{"siteCount":18,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["31630479","28837207"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":62,"n":148},"commonTop":["Platelet count decreased","Bleeding","Injection site reaction","Anemia","Lymphocyte count decreased"]}}
