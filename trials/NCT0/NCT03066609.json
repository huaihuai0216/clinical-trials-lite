Moderate to severe psoriasis as defined at Baseline by:\n\n   * PASI score of 12 or greater, and\n   * IGA mod 2011 score of 3 or greater (based on a static scale of 0 - 4), and\n   * Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by plaque-type psoriasis of 10% or greater.\n5. Candidate for systemic therapy. This is defined as a subject having moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis that is inadequately controlled by\n\n   * topical treatment and/or,\n   * phototherapy and/or,\n   * previous systemic therapy.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque-type (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and guttate psoriasis) at Screening or Baseline.\n2. Drug-induced psoriasis.\n3. Ongoing use of prohibited treatments.\n4. Previous exposure to secukinumab (AIN457) or any other biologic drug directly targeting IL-17 or the IL-17 receptor.\n5. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 5 half-lives of enrollment, or within 30 days until the expected pharmacodynamic effect has returned to baseline, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local regulations.\n6.
