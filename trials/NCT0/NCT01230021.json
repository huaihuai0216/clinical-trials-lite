Normal blood clots generally remain stable for 24 hours or more, while clots in which fibrin molecules have not been cross-linked are soluble within minutes. The outcome of the test is normal (FXIII present; a clot is observed in the test tube) or abnormal (FXIII absent or very low level; no clot in test tube).","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"4","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Vital Signs - Pulse","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"95.3","spread":"14.3"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"113.2","spread":"10.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Vital Signs - Blood Pressure (Systolic and Diastolic)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"98.5","spread":"10.9"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"107.0","spread":"13.7"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"59.8","spread":"12.1"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"64.0","spread":"7.6"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Physical Examination (Evaluated as Normal/Abnormal)","description":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"6","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"5","spread":null}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"1","spread":null}]}]}]}],"adverseEventsModule":{"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":6},"commonTop":["Pyrexia","Pain In Extremity"]}}}
