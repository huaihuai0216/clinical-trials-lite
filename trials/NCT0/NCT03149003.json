Multifocal disease is defined as discrete sites of disease without contiguous T2/FLAIR abnormality that require distinct radiotherapy ports.

(Patients with bundle branch block and a prolonged QTc interval should be reviewed by the Medical Monitor for potential inclusion.)\n* Patient has dyspnea at rest (CTCAE ≥ Grade 3) or has required supplemental oxygen within 2 weeks of study enrollment.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"locations":{"multicenter":true},"periods":[],"outcomeMeasures":[{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity","description":"The number of participants with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) who were enrolled into Part 1 - the safety set.","paramType":"COUNT_OF_PARTICIPANTS","dispersionType":null,"classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"PRIMARY","title":"Overall Survival (OS) of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Treated With DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion Plus Bevacizumab (BEV) Versus BEV Alone","description":"The effect of DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion plus BEV versus BEV alone on the OS of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy.","paramType":"MEDIAN","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"10.2","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"9.4","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Overall Survival (OS) of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Treated With DSP-7888 Dosing Emulsion Plus Bevacizumab (BEV) Versus BEV Alone at 12 Months","description":"The effect of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus BEV versus BEV alone on the OS of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy.","paramType":"NUMBER","dispersionType":"95% Confidence Interval","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG001","value":"37.9","spread":null},{"groupId":"OG002","value":"31.6","spread":null}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Progression Free Survival (PFS) of Patients With Recurrent or Progressive GBM","description":"The effect of DSP-7888 dosing emulsion plus Bevacizumab (BEV) versus BEV alone on the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients with recurrent or progressive GBM following treatment with first line therapy consisting of surgery and radiation with or without chemotherapy.
