The endpoint was totaled through Week 24, divided by the number of days on treatment for each participant, then multiplied by 30 days to get the number of visits per 30 days.","paramType":"MEAN","dispersionType":"Standard Deviation","classes":[{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.726","spread":"1.472"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.779","spread":"1.690"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.279","spread":"0.718"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.312","spread":"0.656"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.402","spread":"2.273"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.562","spread":"2.187"}]}]},{"categories":[{"measurements":[{"groupId":"OG000","value":"0.037","spread":"0.156"},{"groupId":"OG001","value":"0.067","spread":"0.195"}]}]}]},{"type":"SECONDARY","title":"Mean Number of Laboratory Visits, Radiology Visits, Home Healthcare Visits, and Medical Procedures at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4","description":"The number of non-study laboratory visits (NSLVs), non-study radiology visits (NSRVs), and home healthcare visits (HHVs) were each collected as a single question on the eCRF.
