Sargramostim may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether yeast derived sargramostim and vaccine therapy are more effective alone or together in preventing recurrence of melanoma.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Overall Survival","timeFrame":"assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry and every 6 months if patient is 2-5 years from study entry, and annually if >5 years, up to year 15","effectByArm":[{"arm":"GM-CSF","deltaMin":69.6,"sd":null},{"arm":"GM-CSF Placebo","deltaMin":59.3,"sd":null}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.528"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":29,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":148,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["26351350"],"seeAlso":["https://nctn-data-archive.nci.nih.gov/"]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":12,"n":104},"commonTop":["Injection site reaction","Fatigue","Myalgia","Headache","Arthralgia"]}}
