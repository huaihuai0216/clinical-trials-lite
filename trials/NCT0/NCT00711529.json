The resulting symptoms, most notably hot flashes, can cause significant detriment to a patient's quality of life. Treatment for menopausal symptoms with the gold standard of hormone replacement therapy is not done routinely as it is unclear whether it can increase risk of tumor recurrence. In addition, many medical oncologists feel it is contraindicated in this population, especially among women whose breast cancers have estrogen receptors. This has lead to an increased interest in options other than estrogen replacement in the treatment of hot flashes, though most investigations of alternative medications have shown a suboptimal response.\n\nRecent studies have suggested that non-drug treatments using alternative or complementary therapies may be effective. Specifically, hypnosis has been promoted as a means to control hot flashes, though it has not been tested in a randomized fashion. In accordance with the National Cancer Institute's recent initiatives to expand the goals of clinical trials to include symptom management studies, our purpose is to evaluate the role of complementary and alternative therapies for improvement of symptoms in women with breast cancer. Specifically, we plan to evaluate the use of hypnotherapy for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. We intend to recruit 60 women into a pilot feasibility trial comparing hypnotherapy to the drug gabapentin (NeurontinÂ®) for the treatment of therapy-induced hot flashes in eligible women who are receiving care at the Breast Health Center. We have chosen gabapentin based on recent studies showing it may be an effective non-estrogen treatment for this indication.\n\nWe will identify patients who are experiencing at least one daily hot flash as a result of the treatment they received for their breast cancer for participation. When enrolled, they will be randomized into either the treatment arm, in which they will receive daily gabapentin, or the experimental arm, in which they will undergo weekly hypnotherapy.\n\nOur study hypothesis is that hypnotherapy will be more effective than gabapentin in the control of hot flashes in this population.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Number of Daily Hot Flashes","timeFrame":"Baseline","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Hypnotherapy","deltaMin":5,"sd":null},{"arm":"Gabapentin","deltaMin":4.5,"sd":null}],"pValues":[]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"18 Years","sex":"FEMALE","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":17,"exclusionCount":7},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":["2261364","15803359","8622093","9131274","7595732","12488406","14679153","7999463","9469334","14615446","15908646","9576289","11145492","17227907","15632378","16816054","17146104","14997058","16139656","17048223","15376607","12732444","16821087","6646795","9610214","11738160","9179103","9440735","8874337","8997794","8800609","11731510","24022390"],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":13},"commonTop":[]}}
