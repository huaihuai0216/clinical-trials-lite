The goal of this study is to detect changes in PROs and caregiver burden during treatment for atopic dermatitis of moderate or less severity. The study design will allow us to correlate PROs and caregiver burden with treatment response and disease improvement in children.","primaryOutcome":{"measure":"Mean Change in Children's PROMIS Pediatric Itch Short-Form","timeFrame":"baseline to 12 weeks","effectByArm":[{"arm":"Crisaborole","deltaMin":-0.3,"sd":0.8},{"arm":"Tacrolimus 0.03%","deltaMin":-0.4,"sd":0.8}],"pValues":[{"comp":"OG000 vs OG001","p":"0.433"}]},"eligibility":{"minAge":"2 Years","sex":"ALL","healthyVolunteers":false,"inclusionCount":null,"exclusionCount":null},"locations":{"siteCount":1,"countries":["United States"]},"refs":{"pmids":[],"seeAlso":[]},"adverseEventsSummary":{"seriousAny":{"events":0,"n":16},"commonTop":["atopic dermatitis flare","molluscum","lacerations and bruising","nose bleed"]}}
